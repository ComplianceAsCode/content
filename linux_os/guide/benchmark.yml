title: Guide to the Secure Configuration of {{{ full_name }}}

status: draft

description: |
    This guide presents a catalog of security-relevant
    configuration settings for {{{ full_name }}}. It is a rendering of
    content structured in the eXtensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF)
    in order to support security automation.  The SCAP content is
    is available in the <tt>scap-security-guide</tt> package which is developed at
    {{{ weblink(link="https://www.open-scap.org/security-policies/scap-security-guide") }}}.
    <br/><br/>
    Providing system administrators with such guidance informs them how to securely
    configure systems under their control in a variety of network roles. Policy
    makers and baseline creators can use this catalog of settings, with its
    associated references to higher-level security control catalogs, in order to
    assist them in security baseline creation. This guide is a <em>catalog, not a
    checklist</em>, and satisfaction of every item is not likely to be possible or
    sensible in many operational scenarios. However, the XCCDF format enables
    granular selection and adjustment of settings, and their association with OVAL
    and OCIL content provides an automated checking capability. Transformations of
    this document, and its associated automated checking content, are capable of
    providing baselines that meet a diverse set of policy objectives. Some example
    XCCDF <em>Profiles</em>, which are selections of items that form checklists and
    can be used as baselines, are available with this guide. They can be
    processed, in an automated fashion, with tools that support the Security
    Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). The DISA STIG, which provides required
    settings for US Department of Defense systems, is one example of a baseline
    created from this guidance.
