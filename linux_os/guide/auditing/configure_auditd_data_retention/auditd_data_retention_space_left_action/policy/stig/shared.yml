srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must notify the System Administrator (SA) and Information System Security Officer (ISSO) (at a minimum) when allocated audit record storage volume 75 percent utilization.

vuldiscussion: |-
    If security personnel are not notified immediately when storage volume reaches 75 percent utilization, they are unable to plan for audit record storage capacity expansion.

checktext: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} notifies the SA and ISSO (at a minimum) when allocated audit record storage volume reaches 75 percent of the repository maximum audit record storage capacity with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -w space_left_action /etc/audit/auditd.conf

    space_left_action = email

    If the value of the "space_left_action" is not set to "email", or if the line is commented out, ask the System Administrator to indicate how the system is providing real-time alerts to the SA and ISSO.

    If there is no evidence that real-time alerts are configured on the system, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to initiate an action to notify the SA and ISSO (at a minimum) when allocated audit record storage volume reaches 75 percent of the repository maximum audit record storage capacity by adding/modifying the following line in the /etc/audit/auditd.conf file.

    space_left_action = email
