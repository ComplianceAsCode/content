    {{{ full_name }}} must label all off-loaded audit logs before sending them to the central log server.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Enriched logging is needed to determine who, what, and when events occur on a system.  Without this, determining root cause of an event will be much more difficult.

    When audit logs are not labeled before they are sent to a central log server, the audit data will not be able to be analyzed and tied back to the correct system.

checktext: |-
    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} Audit Daemon is configured to label all off-loaded audit logs, with the following command:

    $ sudo grep name_format /etc/audit/auditd.conf

    name_format = hostname

    If the "name_format" option is not "hostname", "fqd", or "numeric", or the line is commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Edit the /etc/audit/auditd.conf file and add or update the "name_format" option:

    name_format = hostname

    The audit daemon must be restarted for changes to take effect.
