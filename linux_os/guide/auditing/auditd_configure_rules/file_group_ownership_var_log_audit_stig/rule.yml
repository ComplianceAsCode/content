title: 'System Audit Logs Must Be Group Owned By Root'

# This rule is specific to STIG, which has stricted requirements for group ownership
# For CIS, use rule "file_group_ownership_var_log_audit"

description: |-
    All audit logs must be group owned by root user.

    Determine where the audit logs are stored with the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep -iw log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf
    log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log</pre>

    Using the path of the directory containing the audit logs, determine if the audit log files
    are owned by the "root" group by using the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo stat -c "%n %G" /var/log/audit/*
    /var/log/audit/audit.log root</pre>
    If the audit log files are owned by a group other than "root", this is a finding.

    To remediate, configure the audit log directory and its underlying files to be owned by "root"
    group.

    Set the "log_group" parameter of the audit configuration file to the "root" value so when a
    new log file is created, its group owner is properly set:
    <pre>$ sudo sed -i '/^log_group/D' /etc/audit/auditd.conf
    $ sudo sed -i /^log_file/a'log_group = root' /etc/audit/auditd.conf</pre>

    Last, signal the audit daemon to reload the configuration file to update the group owners
    of existing files:
    <pre>$ sudo systemctl kill auditd -s SIGHUP</pre>

rationale: |-
    Unauthorized disclosure of audit records can reveal system and configuration data to
    attackers, thus compromising its confidentiality.
