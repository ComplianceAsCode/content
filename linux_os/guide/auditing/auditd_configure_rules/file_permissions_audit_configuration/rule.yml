title: 'Audit Configuration Files Permissions are 640 or More Restrictive'

description: |-
    All audit configuration files permissions must be 640 or more restrictive.
    <pre>chmod 0640 /etc/audit/audit*.{rules,conf} /etc/audit/rules.d/*</pre>

rationale: |-
    Without the capability to restrict which roles and individuals can
    select which events are audited, unauthorized personnel may be able
    to prevent the auditing of critical events.
    Misconfigured audits may degrade the system's performance by
    overwhelming the audit log. Misconfigured audits may also make it more
    difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating
    to an incident or identify those responsible for one.
