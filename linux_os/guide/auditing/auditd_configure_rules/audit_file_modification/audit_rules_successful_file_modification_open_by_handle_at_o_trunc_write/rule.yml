title: 'Record Successful Creation Attempts to Files - open_by_handle_at O_TRUNC_WRITE'


description: |-
    The audit system should collect detailed file access records for
    all users and root. The <tt>open_by_handle_at</tt> syscall can be used to modify
    files if called for write operation with the O_TRUNC_WRITE flag.

    The following audit rules will assure that successful attempts to create a
    file via <tt>open_by_handle_at</tt> syscall are collected.

    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>augenrules</tt>
    program to read audit rules during daemon startup (the default), add the
    rules below to a file with suffix <tt>.rules</tt> in the directory
    <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>.

    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>
    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the rules below to
    <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file.

    <pre>
    -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S open_by_handle_at -F a2&amp;01003 -F success=1 -F auid>={{{ auid }}} -F auid!=unset -F key=successful-modification
    </pre>

    If the system is 64 bit then also add the following lines:
    <pre>
    -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S open_by_handle_at -F a2&amp;01003 -F success=1 -F auid>={{{ auid }}} -F auid!=unset -F key=successful-modification
    </pre>

rationale: |-
    Successful attempts to access files could be an indicator of malicious activity on a system. Auditing
    these events could serve as evidence of potential system compromise.

warnings:
    - general: |-
        Note that these rules can be configured in a
        number of ways while still achieving the desired effect. Here the system calls
        have been placed independent of other system calls. Grouping system calls related
        to the same event is more efficient. See the following example:
        <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S open,open_by_handle_at -F a2&amp;01003 -F success=1 -F auid>={{{ auid }}} -F auid!=unset -F key=successful-modification</pre>
