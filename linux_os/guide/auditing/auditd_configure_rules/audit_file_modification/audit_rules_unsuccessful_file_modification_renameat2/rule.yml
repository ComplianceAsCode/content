title: 'Record Unsuccessful Delete Attempts to Files - renameat2'

description: |-
    The operating system must generate audit records for all uses of the <tt>renameat2</tt> system call.
    Without generating audit records specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would be 
    difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.
    Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).
    Add or update the following lines to <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules</tt> to configure the operating system to generate 
    an audit record for all uses of the <tt>renameat2</tt> system call:  
    <pre>
    -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S renameat2 -F auid>={{{ uid_min }}} -F auid!=-1 -k perm_mod
    -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S renameat2 -F auid>={{{ uid_min }}} -F auid!=-1 -k perm_mod</pre>

rationale: |-
    Unsuccessful attempts to delete files could be an indicator of malicious activity on a system. Auditing
    these events could serve as evidence of potential system compromise.

    - general: |-
        Note that these rules can be configured in a
        number of ways while still achieving the desired effect. Here the system calls
        have been placed independent of other system calls. Grouping system calls related
        to the same event is more efficient. See the following example:
        <pre>
        -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S renameat2 -F auid>={{{ uid_min }}} -F auid!=4294967295 -k perm_mod
        -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S renameat2 -F auid>={{{ uid_min }}} -F auid!=4294967295 -k perm_mod</pre>
