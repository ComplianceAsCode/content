title: 'Record Events that Modify the System''s Mandatory Access Controls (/etc/selinux)'

description: |-
    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the
    <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules during daemon startup (the
    default), add the following line to a file with suffix <tt>.rules</tt> in the
    directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>:
    <pre>-w /etc/selinux/ -p wa -k MAC-policy</pre>
    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>
    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following line to
    <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file:
    <pre>-w /etc/selinux/ -p wa -k MAC-policy</pre>

rationale: |-
    The system's mandatory access policy (SELinux) should not be
    arbitrarily changed by anything other than administrator action. All changes to
    MAC policy should be audited.

ocil_clause: 'the system is not configured to audit attempts to change files within the /etc/selinux directory'

ocil: |-
    To determine if the system is configured to audit changes to its SELinux
    configuration files, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo auditctl -l | grep "dir=/etc/selinux"</pre>
    If the system is configured to watch for changes to its SELinux
    configuration, a line should be returned (including
    <tt>perm=wa</tt> indicating permissions that are watched).
