title: 'Record Any Attempts to Run apparmor_parser'

description: |-
    {{{ describe_arpc("/sbin/apparmor_parser") }}}

rationale: |-
    Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and
    mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish,
    correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify
    those responsible for one.
    Audit records can be generated from various components within the
    information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

    To verify that execution of the command is being audited, run the following command:
    <pre>sudo auditctl -l | grep apparmor_parser</pre>
    The output should return something similar to:
    <pre>-a always,exit -F path=/sbin/apparmor_parser -F perm=x -F auid>={{{ uid_min }}} -F auid!=-1 -F key=privileged</pre>
