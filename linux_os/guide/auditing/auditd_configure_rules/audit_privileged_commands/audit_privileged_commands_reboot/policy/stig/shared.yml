srg_requirement: |-
    Successful/unsuccessful uses of the reboot command in {{{ full_name }}} must generate an audit record.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Misuse of the reboot command may cause availability issues for the system.

checktext: |-
    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} is configured to audit the execution of the "reboot" command with the following command:

    $ sudo auditctl -l | grep reboot

    -a always,exit -S all -F path=/usr/sbin/reboot -F perm=x -F auid&gt;={{{ uid_min }}} -F auid!=-1 -F key=privileged-reboot

    If the command does not return a line, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the audit system to generate an audit event for any successful/unsuccessful uses of the "reboot" command by adding or updating the following rule in the "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules" file:

    -a always,exit -F path=/usr/sbin/reboot -F perm=x -F auid&gt;={{{ uid_min }}} -F auid!=unset -k privileged-reboot

    To load the rules to the kernel immediately, use the following command:

    $ sudo augenrules --load
