title: 'Ensure auditd Collects Information on the Use of Privileged Commands - chfn'

description: |-
    {{{ describe_arpc("/usr/bin/chfn") }}}

rationale: |-
    Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and
    mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish,
    correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify
    those responsible for one.

    Audit records can be generated from various components within the
    information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

    To verify that auditing of privileged command use is configured, run the
    following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep chfn /etc/audit/audit.rules /etc/audit/rules.d/*</pre>
    It should return a relevant line in the audit rules.
