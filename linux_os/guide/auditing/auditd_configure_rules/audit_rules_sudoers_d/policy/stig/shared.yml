    {{{ full_name }}} must generate audit records for all account creations, modifications, disabling, and termination events that affect /etc/sudoers.d/ directory.

vuldiscussion: |-
    The actions taken by system administrators must be audited to keep a record of what was executed on the system, as well as for accountability purposes. Editing the sudoers file may be sign of an attacker trying to establish persistent methods to a system, auditing the editing of the sudoers files mitigates this risk.

    Verify {{{ full_name }}} generates audit records for all account creations, modifications, disabling, and termination events that affect "/etc/sudoers.d/" with the following command:

    $ sudo auditctl -l | grep /etc/sudoers.d

    -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -F path=/etc/sudoers.d/ -F perm=wa -F key=identity
    -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -F path=/etc/sudoers.d/ -F perm=wa -F key=identity

    If the command does not return a line, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.

    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to generate audit records for all account creations, modifications, disabling, and termination events that affect "/etc/sudoers.d/".

    Add or update the following file system rule to "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules":

    -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -F path=/etc/sudoers.d/ -F perm=wa -F key=identity
    -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -F path=/etc/sudoers.d/ -F perm=wa -F key=identity

    The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
