description: |-
    {{{ describe_audit_rules_watch("/etc/hostname", "audit_rules_networkconfig_modification_hostname") }}}

    The network environment should not be modified by anything other
    than administrator action. Any change to network parameters should be
    audited.

    To determine if the system is configured to audit changes to its network configuration,
    run the following command:
    <pre>auditctl -l | grep -E '/etc/hostname'</pre>
    If the system is configured to watch for network configuration changes, a line should
    be returned and <tt>perm=wa</tt> should be indicated.
