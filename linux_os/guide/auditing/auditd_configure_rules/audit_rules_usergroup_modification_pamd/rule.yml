title: 'Record Events that Modify User/Group Information - /etc/pam.d/'

description: |-
    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the
    <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules during daemon startup (the
    default), add the following lines to a file with suffix <tt>.rules</tt> in the
    directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>, in order to capture events that modify
    account changes:
    <br /><br />
    <pre>-w /etc/pam.d/ -p wa -k audit_rules_usergroup_modification</pre>
    <br /><br />
    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>
    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following lines to
    <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file, in order to capture events that modify
    account changes:
    <br /><br />
    <pre>-w /etc/pam.d/ -p wa -k audit_rules_usergroup_modification</pre>

rationale: |-
    The PAM configuration files in /etc/pam.d define the authentication mechanism
    used by PAM-aware applications. Any unexpected changes to PAM configuration
    should be investigated.
