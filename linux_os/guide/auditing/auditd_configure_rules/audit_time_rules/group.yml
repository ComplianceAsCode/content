title: 'Records Events that Modify Date and Time Information'

description: |-
    Arbitrary changes to the system time can be used to obfuscate
    nefarious activities in log files, as well as to confuse network services that
    are highly dependent upon an accurate system time. All changes to the system
    time should be audited.
