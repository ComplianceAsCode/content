title: 'Record Events that Modify the System''s Mandatory Access Controls (/etc/apparmor.d)'

description: |-
    {{{ describe_audit_rules_watch("/etc/apparmor.d/", "MAC-policy") }}}

rationale: |-
    The system's mandatory access policy (Apparmor) should not be
    arbitrarily changed by anything other than administrator action. All changes to
    MAC policy should be audited.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: 'the system is not configured to audit attempts to change files within the /etc/apparmor.d directory'
