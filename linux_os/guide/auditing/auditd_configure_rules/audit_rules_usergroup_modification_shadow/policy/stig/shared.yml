    {{{ full_name }}} must generate audit records for all account creations, modifications, disabling, and termination events that affect /etc/shadow.

vuldiscussion: |-
    In addition to auditing new user and group accounts, these watches will alert the system administrator(s) to any modifications. Any unexpected users, groups, or modifications should be investigated for legitimacy.

    Verify {{{ full_name }}} generates audit records for all account creations, modifications, disabling, and termination events that affect "/etc/passwd with the following command:

    $ sudo auditctl -l | egrep '(/etc/shadow)'

    -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -F path=/etc/shadow -F perm=wa -F key=identity
    -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -F path=/etc/shadow -F perm=wa -F key=identity


    If the command does not return a line, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to generate audit records for all account creations, modifications, disabling, and termination events that affect "/etc/shadow".

    Add or update the following file system rule to "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules":

    -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -F path=/etc/shadow -F perm=wa -F key=identity
    -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -F path=/etc/shadow -F perm=wa -F key=identity

    The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
