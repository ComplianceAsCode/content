    If users can write to audit logs, audit trails can be modified or destroyed.

    Verify the audit log directories have a correct mode or less permissive mode.

    Find the location of the audit logs:

    $ sudo grep "^log_file" /etc/audit/auditd.conf

    Find the group that owns audit logs:

    $ sudo grep "^log_group" /etc/audit/auditd.conf

    Run the following command to check the mode of the system audit logs:

    $ sudo stat -c "%a %n" [audit_log_directory]

    Replace "[audit_log_directory]" to the correct audit log directory path, by default this location is "/var/log/audit".

    If the log_group is "root" or is not set, the correct permissions are 0700, otherwise they are 0750.

    If audit logs have a more permissive mode, then this is a finding.

    The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
