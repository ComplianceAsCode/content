    {{{ describe_audit_rules_watch("/etc/sysconfig/network", "system-locale") }}}

    audited.

    To determine if the system is configured to audit changes to its network configuration,
    run the following command:
    <pre>auditctl -l | grep -E '/etc/sysconfig/network'</pre>
    If the system is configured to watch for network configuration changes, a line should
    be returned and <tt>perm=wa</tt> should be indicated.
