    {{{ full_name }}} audit log directory must be owned by root to prevent unauthorized read access.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Unauthorized disclosure of audit records can reveal system and configuration data to attackers, thus compromising its confidentiality.

checktext: |-
    Verify the audit logs directory is owned by "root".

    Determine where the audit logs are stored with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -iw log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf

    log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log

    Using the location of the audit log file, determine if the audit log directory is owned by "root" using the following command:

    $ sudo stat -c '%U %n' /var/log/audit

    root /var/log/audit

    If the audit log directory is not owned by "root", this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the audit log to be protected from unauthorized read access by setting the correct owner as "root" with the following command:

    $ sudo chown root /var/log/audit
