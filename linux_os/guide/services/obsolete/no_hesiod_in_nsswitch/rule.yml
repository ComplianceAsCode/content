title: "Name Service Switch does not use Hesiod"

description: |-
    Each call to a function which retrieves data from a system database like the
    password or group database is handled by the Name Service Switch
    implementation in the GNU C library. The various services provided are
    implemented by independent modules, each of which naturally varies widely
    from the other. One of such modules is the <tt>hesiod</tt> module, which allows
    to get information from special DNS records.

rationale: |-
    This way of getting information for authentication is not secure. The
    communication can be spoofed and ensuring trust between the client and the
    DNS server is hard to achieve.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: "a hesiod service is configured in nsswitch.conf"

ocil: |-
    Run the following command:
    <pre>grep '^\w+\s+(\w+\s+)*hesiod($|\s+.*$)' /etc/nsswitch.conf</pre>
    If a line is returned and it contains the word <tt>hesiod</tt> in the list
    of services, it is a finding.

warnings:
    - general:
        This rule does not have remediation. Editing the
        <tt>/etc/nsswitch.conf</tt> incorrectly can disrupt access to the
        system.
