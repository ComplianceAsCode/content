title: 'Obsolete Services'

description: |-
    This section discusses a number of network-visible
    services which have historically caused problems for system
    security, and for which disabling or severely limiting the service
    has been the best available guidance for some time. As a result of
    this, many of these services are not installed as part of {{{ full_name }}}
    by default.
    <br /><br />
    Organizations which are running these services should
    switch to more secure equivalents as soon as possible.
    If it remains absolutely necessary to run one of
    these services for legacy reasons, care should be taken to restrict
    the service as much as possible, for instance by configuring host
    {{% if product == "rhel7" %}}
    firewall software such as <tt>firewalld</tt> to restrict access to the
    {{% else %}}
    firewall software such as <tt>iptables</tt> to restrict access to the
    {{% endif %}}
    vulnerable service to only those remote hosts which have a known
    need to use it.
