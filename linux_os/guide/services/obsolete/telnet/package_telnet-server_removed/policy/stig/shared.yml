    It is detrimental for operating systems to provide, or install by default,
    functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These
    unnecessary capabilities are often overlooked and therefore may remain
    unsecure. They increase the risk to the platform by providing additional
    attack vectors.


    The telnet service provides an unencrypted remote access service which does
    not provide for the confidentiality and integrity of user passwords or the
    remote session. If a privileged user were to login using this service, the
    privileged user password could be compromised.


    Removing the "telnet-server" package decreases the risk of the
    telnet service's accidental (or intentional) activation.
