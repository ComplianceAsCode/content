title: 'Remove telnet Clients'

description: |-
    The telnet client allows users to start connections to other systems via
    the telnet protocol.

rationale: |-
    The <tt>telnet</tt> protocol is insecure and unencrypted. The use
    of an unencrypted transmission medium could allow an unauthorized user
    to steal credentials. The <tt>ssh</tt> package provides an
    encrypted session and stronger security and is included in {{{ full_name }}}.
