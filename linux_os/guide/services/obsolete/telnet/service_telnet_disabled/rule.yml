title: 'Disable telnet Service'

description: |-
    The <tt>telnet</tt> service configuration file <tt>/etc/xinetd.d/telnet</tt>
    is not created automatically. If it was created manually, check the
    <tt>/etc/xinetd.d/telnet</tt> file and ensure that <tt>disable = no</tt>
    is changed to read <tt>disable = yes</tt> as follows below:
    <pre>
    # description: The telnet server serves telnet sessions; it uses \\
    #       unencrypted username/password pairs for authentication.
    service telnet
    {
            flags           = REUSE
            socket_type     = stream

            wait            = no
            user            = root
            server          = /usr/sbin/in.telnetd
            log_on_failure  += USERID
            disable         = yes
    }
    </pre>
    If the <tt>/etc/xinetd.d/telnet</tt> file does not exist, make sure that
    the activation of the <tt>telnet</tt> service on system boot is disabled
    via the following command:
    {{{ describe_socket_disable(socket="rexec") }}}

rationale: |-
    The telnet protocol uses unencrypted network communication, which
    means that data from the login session, including passwords and
    all other information transmitted during the session, can be
    stolen by eavesdroppers on the network. The telnet protocol is also
    subject to man-in-the-middle attacks.
