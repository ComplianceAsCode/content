title: NIS

description: |-
    The Network Information Service (NIS), also known as 'Yellow
    Pages' (YP), and its successor NIS+ have been made obsolete by
    Kerberos, LDAP, and other modern centralized authentication
    services. NIS should not be used because it suffers from security
    problems inherent in its design, such as inadequate protection of
    important authentication information.
