title: 'Remove NIS Client'

description: |-
    The Network Information Service (NIS), formerly known as Yellow Pages,
    is a client-server directory service protocol used to distribute system configuration
    files. The NIS client (<tt>ypbind</tt>) was used to bind a system to an NIS server
    and receive the distributed configuration files.

rationale: |-
    The NIS service is inherently an insecure system that has been vulnerable
    to DOS attacks, buffer overflows and has poor authentication for querying
    NIS maps. NIS generally has been replaced by such protocols as Lightweight
    Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). It is recommended that the service be
    removed.
