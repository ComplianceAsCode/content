title: Xinetd

description: |-
    The <tt>xinetd</tt> service acts as a dedicated listener for some
    network services (mostly, obsolete ones) and can be used to provide access
    controls and perform some logging. It has been largely obsoleted by other
    features, and it is not installed by default. The older Inetd service
    is not even available as part of {{{ full_name }}}.
