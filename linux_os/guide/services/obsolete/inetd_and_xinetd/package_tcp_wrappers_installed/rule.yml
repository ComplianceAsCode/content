title: 'Install tcp_wrappers Package'

description: |-
    When network services are using the <tt>xinetd</tt> service, the
    <tt>tcp_wrappers</tt> package should be installed.
    {{{ describe_package_install(package="tcp_wrappers") }}}

rationale: |-
    Access control methods provide the ability to enhance system security posture
    by restricting services and known good IP addresses and address ranges. This
    prevents connections from unknown hosts and protocols.
