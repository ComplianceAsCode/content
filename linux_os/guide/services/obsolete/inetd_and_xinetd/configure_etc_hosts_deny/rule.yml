title: 'Ensure /etc/hosts.deny is configured'

description: |-
    The file <tt>/etc/hosts.deny</tt> together with <tt>/etc/hosts.allow</tt> provides a
    simple access control mechanism for network services supporting TCP wrappers.
    The following line in the file ensures that access to services supporting this mechanism is denied to any clients
    not mentioned in <tt>/etc/hosts.allow</tt>:
    <pre>ALL: ALL</pre>
    It is advised to inspect available network services which might be affected by modification of file mentioned above prior to performing the remediation of this rule.
    If there exist services which might be affected and access to them should not be blocked,
    modify the <tt>/etc/hosts.allow</tt> file appropriately before performing the remediation.


rationale: |-
    Correct configuration in <tt>/etc/hosts.deny</tt> ensures that no explicitly mentioned clients will be able to connect to services supporting this access control mechanism.

ocil_clause: 'access to services supporting TCP wrappers is not properly configured'

ocil: |-
    Display contents of the file:
    <pre>cat /etc/hosts.deny</pre>
    Verify that the output contains the following line:
    <pre>ALL: ALL</pre>

warnings:
    - functionality: |-
        This rule affects all access to services which honor <tt>/etc/hosts.allow</tt> and <tt>/etc/hosts.deny</tt> files.
        Connections to services originating from hosts not explicitly mentioned in <tt>/etc/hosts.allow</tt> will be rejected.
        To avoid locking down all network access to the system, this rule doesn't perform automated remediation.
        For information about manual process of remediation see the rule description.
