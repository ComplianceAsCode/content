    The .shosts files are used to configure host-based authentication for
    individual users or the system via SSH. Host-based authentication is not
    sufficient for preventing unauthorized access to the system, as it does not
    require interactive identification and authentication of a connection request,
    or for the use of two-factor authentication.
