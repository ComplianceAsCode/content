title: 'Remove User Host-Based Authentication Files'

description: |-
    The <tt>~/.shosts</tt> (in each user's home directory) files
    list remote hosts and users that are trusted by the
    local system. To remove these files, run the following command
    to delete them from any location:
    <pre>$ sudo find / -name '.shosts' -type f -delete</pre>

rationale: |-
    The .shosts files are used to configure host-based authentication for
    individual users or the system via SSH. Host-based authentication is not
    sufficient for preventing unauthorized access to the system, as it does not
    require interactive identification and authentication of a connection request,
    or for the use of two-factor authentication.
