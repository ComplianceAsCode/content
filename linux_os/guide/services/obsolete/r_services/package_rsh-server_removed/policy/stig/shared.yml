vuln_discussion: |-
    The "rsh-server" service provides unencrypted remote access service, which does not provide for the confidentiality and integrity of user passwords or the remote session and has very weak authentication. If a privileged user were to login using this service, the privileged user password could be compromised. The "rsh-server" package provides several obsolete and insecure network services. Removing it decreases the risk of accidental (or intentional) activation of those services.
