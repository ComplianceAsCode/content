title: 'Uninstall rsh-server Package'

description: |-
    The <tt>rsh-server</tt> package can be uninstalled with
    the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo yum erase rsh-server</pre>

rationale: |-
    The <tt>rsh-server</tt> service provides unencrypted remote access service which does not
    provide for the confidentiality and integrity of user passwords or the remote session and has very weak
    authentication. If a privileged user were to login using this service, the privileged user password
    could be compromised. The <tt>rsh-server</tt> package provides several obsolete and insecure
    network services. Removing it decreases the risk of those services' accidental (or intentional)
    activation.
