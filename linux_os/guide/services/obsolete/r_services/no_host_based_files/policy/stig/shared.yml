    There must be no shosts.equiv files on {{{ full_name }}}.

    The shosts.equiv files are used to configure host-based authentication for the
    system via SSH. Host-based authentication is not sufficient for preventing
    unauthorized access to the system, as it does not require interactive
    identification and authentication of a connection request, or for the use of
    two-factor authentication.

checktext: |-
    Verify there are no "shosts.equiv" files on {{{ full_name }}} with the following command:

    $ sudo find / -name shosts.equiv

    If a "shosts.equiv" file is found, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Remove any found "shosts.equiv" files from the system.

    $ sudo rm /[path]/[to]/[file]/shosts.equiv
