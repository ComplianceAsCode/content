title: 'Remove Host-Based Authentication Files'

description: |-
    The <tt>shosts.equiv</tt> file list remote hosts
    and users that are trusted by the local system.
    To remove these files, run the following command to delete them from any
    location:
    <pre>$ sudo rm /[path]/[to]/[file]/shosts.equiv</pre>

rationale: |-
    The shosts.equiv files are used to configure host-based authentication for the
    system via SSH. Host-based authentication is not sufficient for preventing
    unauthorized access to the system, as it does not require interactive
    identification and authentication of a connection request, or for the use of
    two-factor authentication.
