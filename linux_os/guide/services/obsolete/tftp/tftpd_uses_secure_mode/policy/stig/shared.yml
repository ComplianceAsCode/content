srg_requirement: |-
    If the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) server is required, the {{{ full_name }}} TFTP daemon must be configured to operate in secure mode.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Restricting TFTP to a specific directory prevents remote users from copying, transferring, or overwriting system files. Using the "-s" option causes the TFTP service to only serve files from the
    given directory.

checktext: |-
    Verify the TFTP daemon is configured to operate in secure mode.

    Check if a TFTP server is installed with the following command:

    $ sudo dnf list --installed tftp-server

    tftp-server.x86_64    5.2-35.el9.x86_64

    If a TFTP server is not installed, this requirement is Not Applicable.

    If a TFTP server is installed, check for the server arguments with the following command:

    $ systemctl cat tftp | grep ExecStart
    ExecStart=/usr/sbin/in.tftpd -s /var/lib/tftpboot

    If the "ExecStart" line does not have a "-s" option, and a subdirectory is not assigned, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the TFTP daemon to operate in secure mode.

    1. Find the path for the systemd service

    $ sudo systemctl show tftp | grep FragmentPath=
    FragmentPath=/etc/systemd/system/tftp.service

    2. Edit the ExecStart line on that file to add the -s option with a subdirectory.

    ExecStart=/usr/sbin/in.tftpd -s /var/lib/tftpboot
