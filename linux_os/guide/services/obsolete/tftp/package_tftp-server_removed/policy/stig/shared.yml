srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must not have a Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) server package installed.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Removing the "tftp-server" package decreases the risk of the accidental
    (or intentional) activation of tftp services.

    If TFTP is required for operational support (such as transmission of router
    configurations), its use must be documented with the Information Systems
    Securty Manager (ISSM), restricted to only authorized personnel, and have
    access control rules established.

checktext: |-
    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} does not have a tftp server package installed with the following command:

    $ sudo dnf list --installed | grep tftp

    If a tftp package is installed, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    The tftp package can be removed with the following command:

    $ sudo dnf remove tftp
