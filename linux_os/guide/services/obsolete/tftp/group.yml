title: 'TFTP Server'

description: |-
    TFTP is a lightweight version of the FTP protocol which has
    traditionally been used to configure networking equipment. However,
    TFTP provides little security, and modern versions of networking
    operating systems frequently support configuration via SSH or other
    more secure protocols. A TFTP server should be run only if no more
    secure method of supporting existing equipment can be
    found.
