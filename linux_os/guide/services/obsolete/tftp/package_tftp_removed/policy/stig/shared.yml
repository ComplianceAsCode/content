    It is detrimental for operating systems to provide, or install by default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These unnecessary capabilities are often overlooked and therefore, may remain unsecure. They increase the risk to the platform by providing additional attack vectors.

    If TFTP is required for operational support (such as transmission of router configurations), its use must be documented with the information systems security manager (ISSM), restricted to only authorized personnel, and have access control rules established.
