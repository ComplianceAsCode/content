    If the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) server is required, the {{{ full_name }}} TFTP daemon must be configured to operate in secure mode.

checktext: |-
    If a TFTP server is not installed, this rule is not applicable.

    Check to see if TFTP server is installed with the following command:

    $ sudo dnf list installed | grep tftp-server
    tftp-server.x86_64 5.2-49.el10

    Verify that the TFTP daemon, if tftp.server is installed, is configured to operate in secure mode with the following command:

    $ systemctl cat tftp.service | grep -i execstart
    ExecStart=/usr/sbin/in.tftpd -s /var/lib/tftpboot

    Note: The "-s" option ensures that the TFTP server only serves files from the specified directory, which is a security measure to prevent unauthorized access to other parts of the file system.

    If the TFTP server is installed but the TFTP daemon is not configured to operate in secure mode, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the TFTP daemon to operate in secure mode with the following command:
    $ sudo systemctl edit tftp.service

    In the editor enter:
    [Service]
    ExecStart=/usr/sbin/in.tftpd -s /var/lib/tftpboot

    After making changes, reload the systemd daemon and restart the TFTP service as follows:
    $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    $ sudo systemctl restart tftp.service

    Restricting TFTP to a specific directory prevents remote users from copying, transferring, or overwriting system files.
