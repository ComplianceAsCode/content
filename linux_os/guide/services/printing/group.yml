title: 'Print Support'

description: |-
    The Common Unix Printing System (CUPS) service provides both local
    and network printing support. A system running the CUPS service can accept
    print jobs from other systems, process them, and send them to the appropriate
    printer. It also provides an interface for remote administration through a web
    browser. The CUPS service is installed and activated by default. The project
    homepage and more detailed documentation are available at
    {{{ weblink(link="http://www.cups.org") }}}.
