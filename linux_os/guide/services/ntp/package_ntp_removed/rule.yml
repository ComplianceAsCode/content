title: 'Remove the ntp service'

description: 'The ntpd service should not be installed.'

rationale: |
   Inaccurate time stamps make it more difficult to correlate events
   and can lead to an inaccurate analysis. Determining the correct
   time a particular event occurred on a system is critical when
   conducting forensic analysis and investigating system events.
   Sources outside the configured acceptable allowance (drift)
   may be inaccurate.
