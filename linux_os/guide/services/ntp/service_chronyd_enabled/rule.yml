title: 'The Chronyd service is enabled'

description: |-
    chrony is a daemon which implements the Network Time Protocol (NTP) is designed to
    synchronize system clocks across a variety of systems and use a source that is highly
    accurate. More information on chrony can be found at
    {{{ weblink(link="http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/") }}}.
    Chrony can be configured to be a client and/or a server.
    To enable Chronyd service, you can run:
    <tt># systemctl enable chronyd.service</tt>
    This recommendation only applies if chrony is in use on the system.

rationale: |-
    If chrony is in use on the system proper configuration is vital to ensuring time
    synchronization is working properly.
