title: 'Ensure a Single Time Synchronization Service is in Use'

description: |-
    The system must have exactly one active time synchronization service to avoid conflicts
    and ensure consistent time synchronization. Only one of the following services should be
    enabled and active at any time:
    <ul>
        <li>chrony - A versatile NTP implementation</li>
        <li>systemd-timesyncd - A lightweight NTP client</li>
    </ul>
    Having zero active time synchronization services leaves the system without accurate
    time synchronization, while having multiple active services can lead to unexpected and
    unreliable results.

rationale: |-
    Running multiple time synchronization services simultaneously can lead to conflicts
    in time synchronization, unpredictable behavior, and unreliable results. A single service
    ensures consistent and accurate time synchronization.

    Having no active time synchronization service leaves the system without accurate
    time synchronization, which can affect security mechanisms, log consistency, and forensic
    investigations.

severity: medium

platform: machine

warnings:
    - general: |-
        This rule does not come with a remediation. There are specific rules
        for enabling each time synchronization service, which should be used instead.
