title: 'Specify Additional Remote NTP Servers'

description: |-
    Depending on specific functional requirements of a concrete
    production environment, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Server system can be
    configured to utilize the services of the <tt>chronyd</tt> NTP daemon (the
    default), or services of the <tt>ntpd</tt> NTP daemon. Refer to
    {{{ weblink(link="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/System_Administrators_Guide/ch-Configuring_NTP_Using_the_chrony_Suite.html") }}}
    for more detailed comparison of the features of both of the choices, and for
    further guidance how to choose between the two NTP daemons.
    <br />
    Additional NTP servers can be specified for time synchronization. To do so,
    perform the following:
    <ul>
    <li> if the system is configured to use the <tt>chronyd</tt> as the NTP daemon
    (the default), edit the file <tt>/etc/chrony.conf</tt> as follows,</li>
    <li> if the system is configured to use the <tt>ntpd</tt> as the NTP daemon,
    edit the file <tt>/etc/ntp.conf</tt> as documented below.</li>
    </ul>
    Add additional lines of the following form, substituting the IP address or
    hostname of a remote NTP server for <em>ntpserver</em>:
    <pre>server <i>ntpserver</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    Specifying additional NTP servers increases the availability of
    accurate time data, in the event that one of the specified servers becomes
    unavailable. This is typical for a system acting as an NTP server for
    other systems.
