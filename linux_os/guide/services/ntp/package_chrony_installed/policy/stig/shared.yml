    Inaccurate time stamps make it more difficult to correlate
    events and can lead to an inaccurate analysis. Determining the correct
    time a particular event occurred on a system is critical when conducting
    forensic analysis and investigating system events. Sources outside the
    configured acceptable allowance (drift) may be inaccurate.
