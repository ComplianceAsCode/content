title: 'Network Time Protocol'

description: |-
    The Network Time Protocol is used to manage the system
    clock over a network. Computer clocks are not very accurate, so
    time will drift unpredictably on unmanaged systems. Central time
    protocols can be used both to ensure that time is consistent among
    a network of systems, and that their time is consistent with the
    outside world.
    <br /><br />
    If every system on a network reliably reports the same time, then it is much
    easier to correlate log messages in case of an attack. In addition, a number of
    cryptographic protocols (such as Kerberos) use timestamps to prevent certain
    types of attacks. If your network does not have synchronized time, these
    protocols may be unreliable or even unusable.
    <br /><br />
    Depending on the specifics of the network, global time accuracy may be just as
    important as local synchronization, or not very important at all. If your
    network is connected to the Internet, using a public timeserver (or one
    provided by your enterprise) provides globally accurate timestamps which may be
    essential in investigating or responding to an attack which originated outside
    of your network.
    <br /><br />
    A typical network setup involves a small number of internal systems operating
    as NTP servers, and the remainder obtaining time information from those
    internal servers.
    <br /><br />
    There is a choice between the daemons <tt>ntpd</tt> and <tt>chronyd</tt>, which
    are available from the repositories in the <tt>ntp</tt> and <tt>chrony</tt>
    packages respectively.
    <br /><br />
    The default <tt>chronyd</tt> daemon can work well when external time references
    are only intermittently accesible, can perform well even when the network is
    congested for longer periods of time, can usually synchronize the clock faster
    and with better time accuracy, and quickly adapts to sudden changes in the rate
    of the clock, for example, due to changes in the temperature of the crystal
    oscillator. <tt>Chronyd</tt> should be considered for all systems which are
    frequently suspended or otherwise intermittently disconnected and reconnected
    to a network. Mobile and virtual systems for example.
    <br /><br />
    The <tt>ntpd</tt> NTP daemon fully supports NTP protocol version 4 (RFC 5905),
    including broadcast, multicast, manycast clients and servers, and the orphan
    mode. It also supports extra authentication schemes based on public-key
    cryptography (RFC 5906). The NTP daemon (<tt>ntpd</tt>) should be considered
    for systems which are normally kept permanently on. Systems which are required
    to use broadcast or multicast IP, or to perform authentication of packets with
    the <tt>Autokey</tt> protocol, should consider using <tt>ntpd</tt>.
