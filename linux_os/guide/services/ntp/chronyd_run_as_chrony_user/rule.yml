title: 'Ensure that chronyd is running under chrony user account'

description: |-
    chrony is a daemon which implements the Network Time Protocol (NTP). It is designed to
    synchronize system clocks across a variety of systems and use a source that is highly
    accurate. More information on chrony can be found at
    {{{ weblink(link="http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/") }}}.
    Chrony can be configured to be a client and/or a server.
    To ensure that chronyd is running under chrony user account, Add or edit the
    <tt>OPTIONS</tt> variable in <tt>/etc/sysconfig/chronyd</tt> to include <tt>-u chrony</tt>:
    <pre>OPTIONS="-u chrony"</pre>
    This recommendation only applies if chrony is in use on the system.

rationale: |-
    If chrony is in use on the system proper configuration is vital to ensuring time synchronization
    is working properly.
