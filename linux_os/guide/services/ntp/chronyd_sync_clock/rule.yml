title: 'Synchronize internal information system clocks'

description: |-
    Synchronizing internal information system clocks provides uniformity
    of time stamps for information systems with multiple system clocks and
    systems connected over a network.

rationale: |-
    Inaccurate time stamps make it more difficult to correlate events and
    can lead to an inaccurate analysis. Determining the correct time a
    particular event occurred on a system is critical when conducting
    forensic analysis and investigating system events.

    Verify the operating system synchronizes internal system clocks to the
    authoritative time source when the time difference is greater than one
    second. Check the value of "makestep" by running the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep makestep {{{ chrony_conf_path }}}
    makestep 1 -1</pre>

    If it is not set to "1 -1", edit the {{{ chrony_conf_path }}} file
    and add:
    <pre>makestep 1 -1</pre>
    Restart the chrony service:
    <pre>$ sudo systemctl restart chrony.service</pre>

template:
    name: "lineinfile"
    vars:
        text: "makestep 1 -1"
        path: {{{ chrony_conf_path }}}
