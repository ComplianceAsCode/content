title: 'Disable chrony daemon from acting as server'

description: |-
    The <tt>port</tt> option in <tt>{{{ chrony_conf_path }}}</tt> can be set to
    <tt>0</tt> to make chrony daemon to never open any listening port
    for server operation and to operate strictly in a client-only mode.

rationale: |-
    Minimizing the exposure of the server functionality of the chrony
    daemon diminishes the attack surface.

severity: low

platform: machine  # The check uses service_... extended definition, which doesn't support offline mode
