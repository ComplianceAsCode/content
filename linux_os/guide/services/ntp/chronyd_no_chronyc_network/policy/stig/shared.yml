    Verify {{{ full_name }}} disables network management of the chrony daemon with the following command:

    $ grep -w cmdport /etc/chrony.conf

    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to disable network management of the chrony daemon by adding/modifying the following line in the /etc/chrony.conf file:

    cmdport 0
