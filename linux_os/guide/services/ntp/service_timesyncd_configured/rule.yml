title: 'Configure Systemd Timesyncd Servers'

description: |-
    <tt>systemd-timesyncd</tt> is a daemon that has been added for synchronizing the system clock
    across the network. The <tt>systemd-timesyncd</tt> daemon implements:
      - Implements an SNTP client
      - Runs with minimal privileges
      - Saves the current clock to disk every time a new NTP sync has been acquired
      - Is hooked up with networkd to only operate when network connectivity is available
    Add or edit server or pool lines to <tt>/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf</tt> as appropriate:
    <pre>server &lt;remote-server&gt;</pre>
    Multiple servers may be configured.

rationale: |-
    Configuring <tt>systemd-timesyncd</tt> ensures time synchronization is working properly.
