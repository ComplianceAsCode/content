title: 'Configure Time Service to use NTS'

description: |-
    The system should be configured to use time servers that support Network Time Security (NTS).
    The specified time server must support NTS and must be configured to use NTS.
    To configure NTS for given time server add <tt>nts</tt> to each <tt>server</tt> or <tt>pool</tt> line in <tt>{{{ chrony_conf_path }}}</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Network Time Security (NTS) uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to secure Network Time Protocol (NTP) communications.
    Not using NTS could allow an attacker to interpret and modify the data sent back from the time server
    Inaccurate time stamps make it more difficult to correlate events and can lead to an inaccurate analysis.
    Determining the correct time a particular event occurred on a system is critical when conducting forensic analysis and investigating system events.
    Sources outside the configured acceptable allowance (drift) may be inaccurate.
