    {{{ full_name }}} must securely compare internal information system clocks at least every 24 hours with a server synchronized to an authoritative time source, such as the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) time servers, or a time server designated for the appropriate DoD network (NIPRNet/SIPRNet), and/or the Global Positioning System (GPS).

    Depending on the infrastruture being used the "pool" directive may not be supported.

checktext: |-
    Run the following command and verify that time sources are only configure with "server" directive:
     # grep -E "^(server|pool)" /etc/chrony.conf
    A line with the appropriate server should be returned, any line returned starting with "pool" is a finding.

    If an authoritative remote time server is not configured or configured with pool directive, then this is a finding.
