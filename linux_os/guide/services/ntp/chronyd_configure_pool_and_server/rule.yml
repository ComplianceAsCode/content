description: |-
    <tt>Chrony</tt> is a daemon which implements the Network Time Protocol (NTP). It is designed to
    synchronize system clocks across a variety of systems and use a source that is highly
    accurate. More information on <tt>chrony</tt> can be found at
    {{{ weblink(link="https://chrony-project.org/") }}}.
    <tt>Chrony</tt> can be configured to be a client and/or a server.

    Multiple servers may be configured.
