title: 'Chrony Configure Server'

description: |-
    <tt>Chrony</tt> is a daemon which implements the Network Time Protocol (NTP). It is designed to
    synchronize system clocks across a variety of systems and use a source that is highly
    accurate. More information on <tt>chrony</tt> can be found at
    {{{ weblink(link="https://chrony-project.org/") }}}.
    <tt>Chrony</tt> can be configured to be a client and/or a server.
    Add or edit server lines to <tt>{{{ chrony_conf_path }}}</tt> as appropriate:
    <pre>server &lt;remote-server&gt;</pre>
    Multiple servers may be configured.
    {{{ full_name }}} must synchronize internal information system clocks
    at least every 24 hours with a server synchronized to an authoritative time source,
    such as the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) time servers, or a time server
    designated for the appropriate DoD network (NIPRNet/SIPRNet)
    Contact organization's IT support for approved time servers.

    If <tt>chrony</tt> is in use on the system proper configuration is vital to ensuring time
    synchronization is working properly.
