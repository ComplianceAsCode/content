title: 'Minimize the DHCP-Configured Options'

description: |-
    Create the file <tt>/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf</tt>, and add an
    appropriate setting for each of the ten configuration settings which can be
    obtained via DHCP. For each setting, do one of the following:
    <br />
    If the setting should <i>not</i> be configured remotely by the DHCP server,
    select an appropriate static value, and add the line:
    <pre>supersede <tt>setting value</tt>;</pre>
    If the setting should be configured remotely by the DHCP server, add the lines:
    <pre>request <tt>setting</tt>;
    require <tt>setting</tt>;</pre>
    For example, suppose the DHCP server should provide only the IP address itself
    and the subnet mask. Then the entire file should look like:
    <pre>supersede domain-name "example.com";
    supersede domain-name-servers 192.168.1.2;
    supersede nis-domain "";
    supersede nis-servers "";
    supersede ntp-servers "ntp.example.com ";
    supersede routers 192.168.1.1;
    supersede time-offset -18000;
    request subnet-mask;
    require subnet-mask;</pre>

rationale: |-
    By default, the DHCP client program, dhclient, requests and applies
    ten configuration options (in addition to the IP address) from the DHCP server.
    subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, routers, domain-name,
    domain-name-servers, host-name, nis-domain, nis-servers, and ntp-servers.  Many
    of the options requested and applied by dhclient may be the same for every
    system on a network. It is recommended that almost all configuration options be
    assigned statically, and only options which must vary on a host-by-host basis
    be assigned via DHCP. This limits the damage which can be done by a rogue DHCP
    server.  If appropriate for your site, it is also possible to supersede the
    host-name directive in <tt>/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf</tt>, establishing a static
    hostname for the system. However, dhclient does not use the host name option
    provided by the DHCP server (instead using the value provided by a reverse DNS
    lookup).

severity: unknown

warnings:
    - general: |-
        In this example, the options nis-servers and
        nis-domain are set to empty strings, on the assumption that the deprecated NIS
        protocol is not in use. It is necessary to supersede settings for unused
        services so that they cannot be set by a hostile DHCP server. If an option is
        set to an empty string, dhclient will typically not attempt to configure the
        service.
