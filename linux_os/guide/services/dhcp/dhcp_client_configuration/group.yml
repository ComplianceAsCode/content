title: 'Configure DHCP Client if Necessary'

description: |-
    If DHCP must be used, then certain configuration changes can
    minimize the amount of information it receives and applies from the network,
    and thus the amount of incorrect information a rogue DHCP server could
    successfully distribute.  For more information on configuring dhclient, see the
    <tt>dhclient(8)</tt> and <tt>dhclient.conf(5)</tt> man pages.
