title: DHCP

description: "The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) allows\nsystems to request and obtain an IP address and other configuration\nparameters from a server.\n<br /><br />\nThis guide recommends configuring networking on clients by manually editing\nthe appropriate files under <tt>/etc/sysconfig</tt>.  Use of DHCP can make client \nsystems vulnerable to compromise by rogue DHCP servers, and should be avoided \nunless necessary.  If using DHCP is necessary, however, there are best practices \nthat should be followed to minimize security risk."
