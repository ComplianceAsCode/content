title: 'Deny Decline Messages'

description: |-
    Edit <tt>/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf</tt> and add or correct the following
    global option to prevent the DHCP server from responding the DHCPDECLINE
    messages, if possible: <pre>deny declines;</pre>

rationale: |-
    The DHCPDECLINE message can be sent by a DHCP client to indicate
    that it does not consider the lease offered by the server to be valid. By
    issuing many DHCPDECLINE messages, a malicious client can exhaust the DHCP
    server's pool of IP addresses, causing the DHCP server to forget old address
    allocations.
