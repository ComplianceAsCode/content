title: 'Do Not Use Dynamic DNS'

description: |-
    To prevent the DHCP server from receiving DNS information from
    clients, edit <tt>/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf</tt>, and add or correct the following global
    option: <pre>ddns-update-style none;</pre>

rationale: |-
    The Dynamic DNS protocol is used to remotely update the data served
    by a DNS server. DHCP servers can use Dynamic DNS to publish information about
    their clients. This setup carries security risks, and its use is not
    recommended.  If Dynamic DNS must be used despite the risks it poses, it is
    critical that Dynamic DNS transactions be protected using TSIG or some other
    cryptographic authentication mechanism. See dhcpd.conf(5) for more information
    about protecting the DHCP server from passing along malicious DNS data from its
    clients.

warnings:
    - general: |-
        The ddns-update-style option controls only whether
        the DHCP server will attempt to act as a Dynamic DNS client. As long as the DNS
        server itself is correctly configured to reject DDNS attempts, an incorrect
        ddns-update-style setting on the client is harmless (but should be fixed as a
        best practice).
