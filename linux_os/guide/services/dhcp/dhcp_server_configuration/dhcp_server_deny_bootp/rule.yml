title: 'Deny BOOTP Queries'

description: |-
    Unless your network needs to support older BOOTP clients, disable
    support for the bootp protocol by adding or correcting the global option:
    <pre>deny bootp;</pre>

rationale: |-
    The bootp option tells dhcpd to respond to BOOTP queries. If support
    for this simpler protocol is not needed, it should be disabled to remove attack
    vectors against the DHCP server.
