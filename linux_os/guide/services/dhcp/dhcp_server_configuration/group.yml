title: 'Configure DHCP Server'

description: |-
    If the system must act as a DHCP server, the configuration
    information it serves should be minimized. Also, support for other protocols
    and DNS-updating schemes should be explicitly disabled unless needed. The
    configuration file for dhcpd is called <tt>/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf</tt>. The file
    begins with a number of global configuration options. The remainder of the file
    is divided into sections, one for each block of addresses offered by dhcpd,
    each of which contains configuration options specific to that address
    block.
