description: |-
    Ensure that the following line exists in
    <tt>/etc/rsyslog.conf</tt>:
    <pre>daemon.*           /var/log/daemon.log</pre>
    Configure logwatch or other log monitoring tools to summarize error conditions
    reported by the dhcpd process.

rationale: |-
    By default, dhcpd logs notices to the daemon facility. Sending all
    daemon messages to a dedicated log file is part of the syslog configuration
    outlined in the Logging and Auditing section
