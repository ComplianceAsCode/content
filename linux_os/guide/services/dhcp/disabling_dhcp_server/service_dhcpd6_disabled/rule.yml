title: 'Disable DHCPD6 Service'

description: |-
    The <tt>dhcp6</tt> service should be disabled on
    any system that does not need to act as a DHCP server.
    {{% if product in ['ubuntu2404'] %}}
    {{{ describe_service_disable(service="isc-dhcp-server6") }}}
    {{% else %}}
    {{{ describe_service_disable(service="dhcpd6") }}}
    {{% endif %}}

rationale: |-
    Unmanaged or unintentionally activated DHCP servers may provide faulty information
    to clients, interfering with the operation of a legitimate site
    DHCP server if there is one.
