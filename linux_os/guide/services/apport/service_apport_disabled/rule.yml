title: 'Disable Apport Service'

prodtype: ubuntu2004

description: |-
    The Apport modifies certain kernel configuration values at
    runtime which may decrease the overall security of the system and expose sensitive data.
    {{{ describe_service_disable(service="apport") }}}

rationale: |-
    The Apport service modifies the kernel
    <tt>fs.suid_dumpable</tt> configuration at runtime which
    prevents other hardening from being persistent. Disabling the
    service prevents this behavior.
