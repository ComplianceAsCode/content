    The kdump service on {{{ full_name }}} must be disabled.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Kernel core dumps may contain the full contents of system memory at the
    time of the crash. Kernel core dumps consume a considerable amount of disk
    space and may result in denial of service by exhausting the available space
    on the target file system partition. Unless the system is used for kernel
    development or testing, there is little need to run the kdump service.

checktext: |-
    To check that the  kdump  service is disabled in system boot configuration,
    run the following command:
     $ sudo systemctl is-enabled  kdump
    Output should indicate the  kdump  service has either not been installed,
    or has been disabled at all runlevels, as shown in the example below:
     $ sudo systemctl is-enabled  kdump
     disabled

    Run the following command to verify  kdump  is not active (i.e. not running) through current runtime configuration:
     $ sudo systemctl is-active kdump

    If the service is not running the command will return the following output:
     inactive

    The service will also be masked, to check that the  kdump  is masked, run the following command:
     $ sudo systemctl show  kdump  | grep "LoadState\|UnitFileState"

    If the service is masked the command will return the following outputs:

     LoadState=masked

     UnitFileState=masked

    If the "kdump" is loaded and not masked, then this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Disable the kdump {{{ full_name }}} service.

    To disable the kdump service run the following command:

    $ sudo systemctl disable --now kdump

    $ sudo systemctl mask --now kdump
