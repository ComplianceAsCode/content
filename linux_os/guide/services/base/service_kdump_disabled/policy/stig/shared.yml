    The kdump service on {{{ full_name }}} must be disabled.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Kernel core dumps may contain the full contents of system memory at the
    time of the crash. Kernel core dumps consume a considerable amount of disk
    space and may result in denial of service by exhausting the available space
    on the target file system partition. Unless the system is used for kernel
    development or testing, there is little need to run the kdump service.

checktext: |-
    Verify that the kdump service is disabled in system boot configuration with the following command:

    $ systemctl is-enabled  kdump

    disabled

    Verify that the kdump service is not active (i.e. not running) through current runtime configuration with the following command:

    $ systemctl is-active kdump

    inactive
    Verify that the kdump service is masked with the following command:

    $ sudo systemctl show  kdump  | grep "LoadState\|UnitFileState"

    LoadState=masked

    UnitFileState=masked

    If the "kdump" service is loaded or active, and is not masked, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Disable and mask the kdump service on {{{ full_name }}}.

    To disable the kdump service run the following command:

    $ sudo systemctl disable --now kdump

    To mask the kdump service run the following command:

    $ sudo systemctl mask --now kdump
    $ sudo systemctl mask --now kdump
