title: 'Uninstall Automatic Bug Reporting Tool (abrt)'

description: |-
    The Automatic Bug Reporting Tool (<tt>abrt</tt>) collects
    and reports crash data when an application crash is detected. Using a variety
    of plugins, abrt can email crash reports to system administrators, log crash
    reports to files, or forward crash reports to a centralized issue tracking
    system such as RHTSupport.
    {{{ describe_package_remove(package="abrt") }}}

rationale: |-
    Mishandling crash data could expose sensitive information about
    vulnerabilities in software executing on the system, as well as sensitive
    information from within a process's address space or registers.
