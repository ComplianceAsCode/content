title: 'Disable Portreserve (portreserve)'

description: |-
    The <tt>portreserve</tt> service is a TCP port reservation utility that can
    be used to prevent portmap from binding to well known TCP ports that are
    required for other services.
    {{{ describe_service_disable(service="portreserve") }}}

rationale: |-
    The <tt>portreserve</tt> service provides helpful functionality by
    preventing conflicting usage of ports in the reserved port range, but it can be
    disabled if not needed.
