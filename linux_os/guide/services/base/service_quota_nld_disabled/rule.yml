title: 'Disable Quota Netlink (quota_nld)'

description: |-
    The <tt>quota_nld</tt> service provides notifications to
    users of disk space quota violations. It listens to the kernel via a netlink
    socket for disk quota violations and notifies the appropriate user of the
    violation using D-Bus or by sending a message to the terminal that the user has
    last accessed.
    {{{ describe_service_disable(service="quota_nld") }}}

rationale: |-
    If disk quotas are enforced on the local system, then the
    <tt>quota_nld</tt> service likely provides useful functionality and should
    remain enabled. However, if disk quotas are not used or user notification of
    disk quota violation is not desired then there is no need to run this
    service.
