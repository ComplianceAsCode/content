title: 'Disable Red Hat Subscription Manager Daemon (rhsmcertd)'

description: |-
    The Red Hat Subscription Manager (rhsmcertd) periodically checks for
    changes in the entitlement certificates for a registered system and updates it
    accordingly.
    <systemd-service-macro enable="false" service="rhsmcertd" />

rationale: |-
    The <tt>rhsmcertd</tt> service can provide administrators with some
    additional control over which of their systems are entitled to particular
    subscriptions. However, for systems that are managed locally or which are not
    expected to require remote changes to their subscription status, it is
    unnecessary and can be disabled.
