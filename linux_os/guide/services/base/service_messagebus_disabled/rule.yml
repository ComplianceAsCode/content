title: 'Disable D-Bus IPC Service (messagebus)'

description: "D-Bus provides an IPC mechanism used by \na growing list of programs, such as those used for Gnome, Bluetooth, and Avahi.\nDue to these dependencies, disabling D-Bus may not be practical for\nmany systems.\n{{{ describe_service_disable(service="messagebus") }}}"

rationale: |-
    If no services which require D-Bus are needed, then it
    can be disabled. As a broker for IPC between processes of different privilege levels,
    it could be a target for attack. However, disabling D-Bus is likely to be
    impractical for any system which needs to provide
    a graphical login session.
