title: 'Disable ntpdate Service (ntpdate)'

description: |-
    The <tt>ntpdate</tt> service sets the local hardware clock by polling NTP servers
    when the system boots. It synchronizes to the NTP servers listed in
    <tt>/etc/ntp/step-tickers</tt> or <tt>/etc/ntp.conf</tt>
    and then sets the local hardware clock to the newly synchronized
    system time.
    {{{ describe_service_disable(service="ntpdate") }}}

rationale: |-
    The <tt>ntpdate</tt> service may only be suitable for systems which
    are rebooted frequently enough that clock drift does not cause problems between
    reboots. In any event, the functionality of the ntpdate service is now
    available in the ntpd program and should be considered deprecated.
