title: 'Disable Web Content Symbolic Links'

description: |-
    For each <tt>&lt;Directory&gt;</tt> instance, remove the following:
    <pre>FollowSymLinks</pre>
    If symbolic links are allowed, the following can be added for each
    <tt>&lt;Directory&gt;</tt> instance:
    <pre>Options SymLinksIfOwnerMatchDisable</pre>

rationale: |-
    A symbolic link allows a file or a directory to be referenced using a symbolic
    name raising a potential hazard if symbolic linkage is made to a sensitive area.
    When web scripts are executed and symbolic links are allowed, the web user could
    be allowed to access locations on the web server that are outside the scope of
    the web document root or home directory.
