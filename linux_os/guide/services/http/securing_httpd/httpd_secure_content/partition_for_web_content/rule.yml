title: 'Ensure Web Content Located on Separate partition'

description: |-
    The <tt>DocumentRoot</tt> directory is used for storing web content and data.
    Ensure that the <tt>DocumentRoot</tt> directory exists on a separate logical
    volume at installation time, or migrate it using LVM.

rationale: |-
    Application partitioning enables an additional security measure by securing
    user traffic under one security context, while managing system and application
    files under another. Web content is can be to an anonymous web user. For such
    an account to have access to system files of any type is a major security risk
    that is avoidable and desirable. Failure to partition the system files from the
    web site documents increases risk of attack via directory traversal, or impede
    web site availability due to drive space exhaustion.

ocil_clause: 'it is not'

ocil: |-
    To verify that each web content directory exists on separate partitions,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep `grep -i documentroot /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf | awk -F'"' '{print $2}'` /etc/fstab</pre>
    Each of the corresponding <tt>DocumentRoot</tt> entries should have a
    corresponding entry in <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>.
