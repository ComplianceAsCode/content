title: 'Encrypt All File Uploads'

description: |-
    Use only secure encrypted logons and connections for uploading files to the web
    site.

rationale: |-
    Logging in to a web server via an unencrypted protocol or service, to upload
    documents to the web site, is a risk if proper encryption is not utilized to
    protect the data being transmitted. An encrypted protocol or service must be
    used for remote access to web administration tasks.

ocil_clause: 'it is not'

ocil: |-
    Determine if there is a process for the uploading of files to the web site.
    This process should include the requirement for the use of a secure encrypted
    logon and secure encrypted connection. If the remote users are uploading files
    without utilizing approved encryption methods, this is a finding.
