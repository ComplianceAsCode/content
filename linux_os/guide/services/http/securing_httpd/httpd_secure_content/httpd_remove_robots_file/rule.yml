title: 'The robots.txt Files Must Not Exist'

description: |-
    Remove any <tt>robots.txt</tt> files that may exist with any web content.
    Other methods must be employed if there is information on the web site that
    needs protection from search engines and public view. Inspect all instances of
    <tt>DocumentRoot</tt> and <tt>Alias</tt> and remove any <tt>robots.txt</tt> file.
    <pre>$ sudo rm -f path/to/robots.txt</pre>

rationale: |-
    Search engines are constantly at work on the Internet. Search engines are
    augmented by agents, often referred to as spiders or bots, which endeavor to
    capture and catalog web-site content. In turn, these search engines make the
    content they obtain and catalog available to any public web user.
    <br /><br />
    To request
    that a well behaved search engine not crawl and catalog a site, the web site may
    contain a file called robots.txt. This file contains directories and files that
    the web server SA desires not be crawled or cataloged, but this file can also be
    used, by an attacker or poorly coded search engine, as a directory and file
    index to a site. This information may be used to reduce an attacker's time
    searching and traversing the web site to find files that might be relevant. If
    information on the web site needs to be protected from search engines and public
    view, other methods must be used.
