title: 'Each Web Content Directory Must Contain An index.html File'

description: |-
    Every <tt>DocumentRoot</tt> that is configured should have an
    <tt>index.html</tt> file that exists. Add an <tt>index.html</tt> file to every
    configured <tt>DocumentRoot</tt>.

rationale: |-
    The goal is to completely control the web users experience in navigating any
    portion of the web document root directories. Ensuring all web content
    directories have at least the equivalent of an index.html file is a significant
    factor to accomplish this end. Also, enumeration techniques, such as URL
    parameter manipulation, rely upon being able to obtain information about the web
    server's directory structure by locating directories with default pages. This
    practice helps ensure that the anonymous web user will not obtain directory
    browsing information or an error message that reveals the server type and
    version.

ocil: |-
    To verify that each web content directory has an <tt>index.html</tt> file,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo find `grep -i documentroot /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf | awk -F'"' '{print $2}'` -name index.html</pre>
    The output should return an <tt>index.html</tt> file for every
    <tt>DocumentRoot</tt> that is set.
