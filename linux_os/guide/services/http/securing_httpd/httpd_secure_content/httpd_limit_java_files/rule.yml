title: 'Remove .java And .jpp Files'

description: |-
    <tt>.java</tt> and <tt>.jpp</tt> files should not exist and should be removed
    from the web server.

rationale: |-
    From the source code in a .java or a .jpp file, the Java compiler produces a
    binary file with an extension of .class. The .java or .jpp file would,
    therefore, reveal sensitive information regarding an application's logic and
    permissions to resources on the server. By contrast, the .class file, because it
    is intended to be machine independent, is referred to as bytecode. Bytecodes are
    run by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), or the Java Runtime Environment (JRE),
    via a browser configured to permit Java code.

    To verify that no <tt>.java</tt> and <tt>.jpp</tt> files exist, run the
    following command:
    <pre>find / -name *.java -o -name *.jpp</pre>
    The output should not return any <tt>.java</tt> or <tt>.jpp</tt> files
