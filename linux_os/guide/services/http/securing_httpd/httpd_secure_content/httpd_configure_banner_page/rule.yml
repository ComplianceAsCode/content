title: 'Configure A Banner Page For Each Website'

description: |-
    Configure a login banner for each website when authentication is required for
    user access.

rationale: |-
    A consent banner will be in place to make prospective entrants aware that the
    website they are about to enter is a DoD web site and their activity is subject
    to monitoring. The document, DoDI 8500.01, establishes the policy on the use of
    DoD information systems. It requires the use of a standard Notice and Consent
    Banner and standard text to be included in user agreements. The requirement for
    the banner is for websites with security and access controls. These are
    restricted and not publicly accessible. If the website does not require
    authentication/authorization for use, then the banner does not need to be
    present. A manual check of the document root directory for a banner page file
    (such as banner.html) or navigation to the website via a browser can be used to
    confirm the information provided from interviewing the web staff.
