title: 'Use Denial-of-Service Protection Modules'

description: |-
    Denial-of-service attacks are difficult to detect and prevent while maintaining
    acceptable access to authorized users. However, some traffic-shaping
    modules can be used to address the problem. Well-known DoS protection modules include:
    <pre>mod_cband mod_bwshare mod_limitipconn mod_evasive</pre>
    Denial-of-service prevention should be implemented for a web server if such a threat exists.
    However, specific configuration details are very dependent on the environment and often best left
    at the discretion of the administrator.
