title: 'Disable Anonymous FTP Access'

description: |-
    If any directories that contain dynamic scripts can be accessed via FTP by
    any group or user that does not require access, remove permissions to such
    directories that allow anonymous access. Also, ensure that any such
    access employs an encrypted connection.

rationale: |-
    The directories containing the CGI scripts, such as PERL, must not be
    accessible to anonymous users via FTP. This applies to all directories that
    contain scripts that can dynamically produce web pages in an interactive manner
    (i.e., scripts based upon user-provided input). Such scripts contain information
    that could be used to compromise a web service, access system resources, or
    deface a web site.

ocil: |-
    Locate the directories containing the CGI scripts. These directories should be
    language-specific (e.g., PERL, ASP, JS, JSP, etc.). Examine the file permissions
    on the directories using the following command:
    <pre>ls -l <i>directories</i></pre>
    Anonymous FTP users must not have access to these directories.
