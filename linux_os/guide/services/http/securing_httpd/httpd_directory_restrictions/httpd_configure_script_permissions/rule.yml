title: 'Remove Write Permissions From Filesystem Paths And Server Scripts'

description: |-
    Configure permissions for each instance of <tt>Alias</tt>,
    <tt>ScriptAlias</tt>, and <tt>ScriptAliasMatch</tt> that exist.
    <pre>$ sudo find <i>DIR</i> -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
    $ sudo find <i>DIR</i> -type f -exec chmod 555 {} \;</pre>
    Where <i>DIR</i> matches the paths from <tt>Alias</tt>,
    <tt>ScriptAlias</tt>, and <tt>ScriptAliasMatch</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Excessive permissions for the anonymous web user account are one of the most
    common faults contributing to the compromise of a web server. If this user is
    able to upload and execute files on the web server, the organization or owner of
    the server will no longer have control of the asset.

    have the correct file and directory permissions applied.
