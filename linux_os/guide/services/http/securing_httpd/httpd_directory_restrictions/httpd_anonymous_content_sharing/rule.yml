title: 'Web Content Directories Must Not Be Shared Anonymously'

description: |-
    Web content directories should not be shared anonymously over remote filesystems
    such as <tt>nfs</tt> and <tt>smb</tt>. Remove the shares from the applicable
    directories.

rationale: |-
    Sharing web content is a security risk when a web server is involved. Users
    accessing the share anonymously could experience privileged access to the
    content of such directories. Network sharable directories expose those
    directories and their contents to unnecessary access. Any unnecessary exposure
    increases the risk that someone could exploit that access and either compromises
    the web content or cause web server performance problems.

ocil: |-
    To verify that web content directories should not be shared anonymously over
    remote filesystems such as <tt>nfs</tt> and <tt>smb</tt>, inspect each instance
    of <tt>DocumentRoot</tt> and <tt>serverRoot</tt> and verify that no entry in
    <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> exists or no remote filesystem process is running for
    any instance.
