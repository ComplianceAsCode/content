title: 'Ignore HTTPD .htaccess Files'

description: |-
    Set <tt>AllowOverride</tt> to <tt>none</tt> for each instant of
    <tt>&lt;Directory&gt;</tt>.

rationale: |-
    CGI scripts represents one of the most common and exploitable means of
    compromising a web server. By definition, CGI are executable by the operating
    system of the host server. While access control is provided via the web service,
    the execution of CGI programs is not otherwise limited unless the SA or Web
    Manager takes specific measures. CGI programs can access and alter data files,
    launch other programs and use the network. CGI programs can be written in any
    available programming language. C, PERL, PHP, Javascript, VBScript and shell
    (sh, ksh, bash) are popular choices.

ocil: |-
    To preclude access to the servers root directory, ensure the following
    directive is in the <tt>httpd.conf</tt> file. This entry will also stop users
    from setting up <tt>.htaccess</tt> files which can override security features
    configured in <tt>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</tt>.
    <pre>AllowOverride none</pre>
