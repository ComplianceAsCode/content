title: 'Enable HTTPD LogLevel'

description: |-
    <tt>LogLevel</tt> should be enabled and set to {{{ xccdf_value("var_httpd_loglevel") }}}.
    Add or edit the following in <tt>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</tt>:
    <pre>LogLevel {{{ xccdf_value("var_httpd_loglevel") }}}</pre>

rationale: |-
    The server error logs are invaluable because they can also be used to identify
    potential problems and enable proactive remediation. Log data can reveal
    anomalous behavior such as "not found" or "unauthorized" errors that may
    be an evidence of attack attempts. Failure to enable error logging can
    significantly reduce the ability of Web Administrators to detect or remediate
    problems. While the ErrorLog directive configures the error log file name, the
    LogLevel directive is used to configure the severity level for the error logs.
    The log level values are the standard syslog levels: emerg, alert, crit, error,
    warn, notice, info and debug.

severity: medium

ocil: |-
    To verify if <tt>LogLevel</tt> is configured correctly in
    <tt>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</tt>, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep -i loglevel /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</pre>
    The command should return the following:
    <pre>LogLevel warn</pre>
