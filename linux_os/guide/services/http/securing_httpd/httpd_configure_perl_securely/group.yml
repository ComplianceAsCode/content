title: 'Configure PERL Securely'

description: |-
    PERL (Practical Extraction and Report Language) is an interpreted language
    optimized for scanning arbitrary text files, extracting information from those
    text files, and printing reports based on that information. The language is
    often used in shell scripting and is intended to be practical, easy to use, and
    efficient means of generating interactive web pages for the user.
