title: 'Configure HTTP PERL Scripts To Use TAINT Option'

description: |-
    If the <tt>mod_perl</tt> module is installed, enable Perl Taint checking in
    <tt>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</tt>. To enable Perl Taint
    checking, add or uncomment the following to <tt>/etc/httpd/conf.d/perl.conf</tt>:
    <pre>PerlSwitches -T</pre>

rationale: |-
    PERL (Practical Extraction and Report Language) is an interpreted language
    optimized for scanning arbitrary text files, extracting information from those
    text files, and printing reports based on that information. The language is
    often used in shell scripting and is intended to be practical, easy to use, and
    efficient means of generating interactive web pages for the user. Unfortunately,
    many widely available freeware PERL programs (scripts) are extremely insecure.
    This is most readily accomplished by a malicious user substituting input to a
    PERL script during a POST or a GET operation.
    <br /><br />
    Consequently, the founders of
    PERL have developed a mechanism named TAINT that protects the system from
    malicious input sent from outside the program. When the data is tainted, it
    cannot be used in programs or functions such as eval(), system(), exec(), pipes,
    or popen(). The script will exit with a warning message.

    To verify if the <tt>mod_perl</tt> is installed, run the following command:
    <pre>$ rpm -qa | grep mod_perl</pre>
    If the <tt>mod_perl</tt> module is installed, verify that <tt>PerlSwitches -T</tt>
    is enabled in <tt>/etc/httpd/conf.d/perl.conf</tt> by running the following
    command:
    <pre>$ grep -i "PerlSwitches -T" /etc/httpd/conf.d/perl.conf</pre>
    The output should return uncommented:
    <pre>PerlSwitches -T</pre>
