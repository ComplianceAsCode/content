title: 'Backup interactive scripts on the production web server are prohibited'

description: |-
    Copies of backup files will not execute on the server, but they can be
    read by the anonymous user if special precautions are not taken.

rationale: |-
    Such backup copies contain the same sensitive information as the actual
    scripts being executed and, as such, are useful to malicious users.
    Techniques and systems exist today that search web servers for such files
    and are able to exploit the information contained in them.

    Backup copies of files are automatically created by some text editors such
    such as emacs and VIM. Editors may write a backup file with an extension
    ~ added to the name of the original file. The edit plus editor will
    create a .bak file. Of course, this would imply the presence and use of
    development tools on the web server, which is a finding under WG130. Having
    backup scripts on the web server provides one more opportunity for
    malicious persons to view these scripts and use the information found in
    them.

ocil_clause: |-
    If fileos with these extensions have no relationship with web activity,
    such as backup batch file for operating system utility, and they are
    not accessible by the web application, this is not a finding.

    If files with these extensions are found in either the document
    directory or the home directory of the web server, this is
    a finding.

    If files with these extensions are stored in a repository (not in the
    document root) as backups for the web server

ocil: |-
    Ensure that CGI backup scripts are not left on the production web server.
    This check is limited to CGI/interactive content and not static HTML.

    Search for backup copies of CGI scripts on the web server or ask the Web
    Administrator if they keep backup copies of CGI scripts on the web server.

    Common backup file extensions are: *.bak, *.old, *.temp, *.tmp, *.backup,
    *.??0. This would also apply to .jsp files.

    On Red Hat Enterprise Linux, run the following commands to find backup
    scripts:
    <pre><tt>find / name "*.bak" -print</tt>
    <tt>find / name "*.*" -print</tt>
    <tt>find / name "*.old" -print</tt></pre>
