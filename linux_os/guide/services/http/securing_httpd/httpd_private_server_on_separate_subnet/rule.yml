title: 'A private web server must be located on a separate controlled access subnet'

description: |-
    Private web servers, which host sites that serve controlled access data,
    must be protected from outside threats in addition to insider threats.

    Isolate the private web server from the public DMZ and separate it from the
    internal general population LAN.

rationale: |-
    Insider threat may be accidental or intentional but, in either case, can
    cause a disruption in service of the web server. To protect the private
    web server from these threats, it must be located on a separate controlled
    access subnet and must not be part of the public DMZ that houses the public
    web servers. it also cannot be located inside the enclave as part of the
    local general population LAN.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: 'the private web server is not on a separate controlled access subnet'

ocil: |-
    Verify the site's network diagram and visually check the web server, to
    ensure that the private web server is located on a separate controlled
    access subnet and is not part of the public DMZ that houses the public
    web servers.

    In addition, the private web server needs to be isolated via a controlled
    access mechanism from the local general population lan.
