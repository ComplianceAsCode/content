title: 'Enable Transport Layer Security (TLS) Encryption'

description: |-
    Disable old SSL and TLS version and enable the latest TLS encryption by setting
    the following in <tt>/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/ssl.conf</tt>:
    <pre>SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3 -TLSv1 -TLSv1.1</pre>
    Make sure to also set <tt>SSLEngine</tt> to <tt>on</tt> in
    <tt>/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/ssl.conf</tt> like the following:
    <pre>SSLEngine on</pre>

rationale: |-
    Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption is a required security setting for a
    private web server. Encryption of private information is essential to ensuring
    data confidentiality. If private information is not encrypted, it can be
    intercepted and easily read by an unauthorized party. A web server must
    use a FIPS 140-2 approved TLS version, and all non-FIPS-approved SSL versions
    must be disabled.

ocil: |-
    To verify that TLS is configured properly in
    <tt>/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/ssl.conf</tt>, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep -i "sslengine\|sslprotocol" /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf</pre>
    The output should return the following:
    <pre>
    SSLEngine on
    SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3 -TLSv1 -TLSv1.1
    </pre>
