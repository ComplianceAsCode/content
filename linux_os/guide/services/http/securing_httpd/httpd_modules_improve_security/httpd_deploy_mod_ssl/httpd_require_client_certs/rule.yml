title: 'Require Client Certificates'

description: |-
    <tt>SSLVerifyClient</tt> should be set and configured to <tt>require</tt> by
    setting the following in <tt>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</tt>:
    <pre>SSLVerifyClient require</pre>

rationale: |-
    Web sites requiring authentication within the DoD must utilize PKI as an
    authentication mechanism for web users. Information systems residing behind web
    servers requiring authorization based on individual identity must use the
    identity provided by certificate-based authentication to support access control
    decisions.
