title: 'Deploy mod_ssl'

description: |-
    Because HTTP is a plain text protocol, all traffic is susceptible to passive
    monitoring. If there is a need for confidentiality, SSL should be configured
    and enabled to encrypt content.
    <br /><br />
    Note: <tt>mod_nss</tt> is a FIPS 140-2 certified alternative to <tt>mod_ssl</tt>.
    The modules share a considerable amount of code and should be nearly identical
    in functionality. If FIPS 140-2 validation is required, then <tt>mod_nss</tt> should
    be used. If it provides some feature or its greater compatibility is required,
    then <tt>mod_ssl</tt> should be used.
