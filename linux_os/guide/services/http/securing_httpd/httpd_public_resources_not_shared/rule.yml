title: 'Public web server resources must not be shared with private assets'

description: |-
    It is important to segregate public web server resources from private
    resources located behind the DoD DMZ in order to protect private
    assets.

rationale: |-
    When folders, drives, or other resources are directly shared between the
    public web server and private servers the intent of data and resource
    segregation can be compromised.

    In addition to the requirements of the DoD Internet-NIPRNet DMZ STIG that
    isolates inbound traffic from external network to the internal network,
    resources such as printers, files, and folders/directories will not be
    shared between public web servers and assets located within the internal
    network.

ocil_clause: |-
    sharing is selected for any web folder, this is a finding.

    If private resources (e.g. drives, partitions, folders/directories,
    printers, etc.) are sharedw ith the public web server

ocil: |-
     Configure the public web server to not have a trusted relationship with
     any system resources that is also not accessible to the public. Web
     content is not to be shared via Microsoft shares or NFS mounts.

     Determine whether the public web server has a two-way trust relationship
     with any private asset located within the network. Private web server
     resources (e.g. drives, folders, printers, etc.) will not be directly
     mapped to or shared with public web servers.
