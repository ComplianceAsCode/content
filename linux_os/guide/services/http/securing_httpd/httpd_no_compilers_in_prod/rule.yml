title: 'Installation of a compiler on production web server is prohibited'

description: |-
    The presence of a compiler on a production server facilitates the malicious
    user's task of creating custom versions of programs and installing Trojan
    Horses or viruses.

rationale: |-
    An attacker's code could be uploaded and compiled on the server
    under attack.

severity: medium

    stigid: "WG080"

ocil_clause: |-
    the web server is part of an application suite and a comiler is needed
    for installation, patching, and upgrading of the suite or if the compiler
    is embedded and can't be removed without breaking the suite, document the
    installation of the compiler with the ISSO/ISSM and verify that the compiler
    is restricted to administrative users only. If documented and restricted to
    administrative users, this is not a finding.

    If an undocumented compiler is present, and available to non-administrative
    users

ocil: |-
    Query the SA and the Web Manager to determine if a compiler is present on
    the server.
