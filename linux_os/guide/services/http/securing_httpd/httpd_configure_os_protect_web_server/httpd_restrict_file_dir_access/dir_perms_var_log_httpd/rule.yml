title: 'Set Permissions on the <tt>/var/log/httpd/</tt> Directory'

description: |-
    Ensure that the permissions on the web server log directory is set to 700:
    <pre>$ sudo chmod 700 /var/log/httpd/</pre>
    This is its default setting.

rationale: |-
    A major tool in exploring the web site use, attempted use, unusual conditions,
    and problems are the access and error logs. In the event of a security incident,
    these logs can provide the SA and the web manager with valuable information. To
    ensure the integrity of the log files and protect the SA and the web manager
    from a conflict of interest related to the maintenance of these files, only the
    members of the Auditors group will be granted permissions to move, copy, and
    delete these files in the course of their duties related to the archiving of
    these files.
