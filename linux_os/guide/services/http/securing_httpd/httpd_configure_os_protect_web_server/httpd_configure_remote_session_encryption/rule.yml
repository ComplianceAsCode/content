title: 'Ensure Remote Administrative Access Is Encrypted'

description: |-
    Ensure that the SSH server service is enabled.
    {{{ describe_service_enable(service="sshd") }}}

rationale: |-
    Logging into a web server remotely using an unencrypted protocol or service
    when performing updates and maintenance is a major risk. Data, such as user
    account, is transmitted in plaintext and can easily be compromised. When
    performing remote administrative tasks, a protocol or service that encrypts the
    communication channel must be used.
    <br /><br />
    An alternative to remote administration of
    the web server is to perform web server administration locally at the console.
    Local administration at the console implies physical access to the server.
