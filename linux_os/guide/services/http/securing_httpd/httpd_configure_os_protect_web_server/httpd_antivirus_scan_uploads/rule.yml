title: 'Scan All Uploaded Content for Malicious Software'

description: |-
    Install anti-virus software on the system and set it to automatically scan new
    files that are introduced to the web server.

rationale: |-
    Remote web authors should not be able to upload files to the Document Root
    directory structure without virus checking and checking for malicious or mobile
    code. A remote web user, whose agency has a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with
    the hosting agency and has submitted a DoD form 2875 (System Authorization
    Access Request (SAAR)) or an equivalent document, will be allowed to post files
    to a temporary location on the server. All posted files to this temporary
    location will be scanned for viruses and content checked for malicious or mobile
    code. Only files free of viruses and malicious or mobile code will be posted to
    the appropriate DocumentRoot directory.
