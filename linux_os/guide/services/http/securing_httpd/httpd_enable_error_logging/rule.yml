title: 'Enable HTTPD Error Logging'

description: |-
    <tt>ErrorLog</tt> should be enabled and set to the following in
    <tt>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</tt>:
    <pre>ErrorLog "logs/error_log"</pre>

rationale: |-
    The server error logs are invaluable because they can also be used to identify
    potential problems and enable proactive remediation. Log data can reveal
    anomalous behavior such as "not found" or "unauthorized" errors that may
    be an evidence of attack attempts. Failure to enable error logging can
    significantly reduce the ability of Web Administrators to detect or remediate
    problems.
