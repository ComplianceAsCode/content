title: 'MIME types for csh or sh shell programs must be disabled'

description: |-
    Users must not be allowed to access the shell programs.

rationale: |-
    Shell programs might execute shell escapes and could then perform
    unauthorized activities that could damage the security posture of the web
    server. A shell is a program that serves as the basic interface between the
    user and the operating system. In this regard, there are shells that are
    security risks in the context of a web server and shells that are
    unauthorized.
