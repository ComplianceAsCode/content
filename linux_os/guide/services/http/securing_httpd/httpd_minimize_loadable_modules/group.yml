title: 'Minimize Web Server Loadable Modules'

description: |-
    A default installation of <tt>httpd</tt> includes a plethora of dynamically shared objects (DSO)
    that are loaded at run-time. Unlike the aforementioned compiled-in modules, a DSO can be
    disabled in the configuration file by removing the corresponding LoadModule directive.
    <br /><br />
    Note: A DSO only provides additional functionality if associated directives are included
    in the <tt>httpd</tt> configuration file. It should also be noted that removing a DSO will produce
    errors on <tt>httpd</tt> startup if the configuration file contains directives that apply to that
    module. Refer to <tt>{{{ weblink(link="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/") }}}</tt> for details on which directives
    are associated with each DSO.
    <br /><br />
    Following each DSO removal, the configuration can be tested with the following command
    to check if everything still works:
    <pre>$ sudo service httpd configtest</pre>
    The purpose of each of the modules loaded by default will now be addressed one at a time.
    If none of a module's directives are being used, remove it.
