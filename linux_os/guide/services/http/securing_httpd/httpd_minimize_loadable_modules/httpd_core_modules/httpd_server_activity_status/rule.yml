title: 'Disable Server Activity Status'

description: |-
    The <tt>status</tt> module provides real-time access to statistics on the internal operation of
    the web server. This may constitute an unnecessary information leak and should be disabled
    unless necessary. To do so, comment out the related module:
    <pre>#LoadModule status_module modules/mod_status.so</pre>
    If there is a critical need for this module, ensure that access to the status
    page is properly restricted to a limited set of hosts in the status handler
    configuration.

rationale: |-
    Minimizing the number of loadable modules available to the web server reduces risk
    by limiting the capabilities allowed by the web server.
