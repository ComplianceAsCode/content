title: 'Disable HTTP mod_rewrite'

description: |-
    The <tt>mod_rewrite</tt> module is very powerful and can protect against
    certain classes of web attacks. However, it is also very complex and has a
    significant history of vulnerabilities itself. If its functionality is
    unnecessary, comment out the related module:
    <pre>#LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so</pre>

rationale: |-
    Minimizing the number of loadable modules available to the web server reduces risk
    by limiting the capabilities allowed by the web server.
