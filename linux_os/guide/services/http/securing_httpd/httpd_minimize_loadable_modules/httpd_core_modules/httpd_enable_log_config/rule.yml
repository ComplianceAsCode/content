title: 'Enable log_config_module For HTTPD Logging'

description: |-
    The <tt>log_config_module</tt> should exist and be configured in
    the <tt>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</tt> file by adding the following module to
    configure logging:
    <pre>log_config_module</pre>

rationale: |-
    A major tool in exploring the web site use, attempted use, unusual conditions,
    and problems are reported in the access and error logs. In the event of a
    security incident, these logs can provide the SA and the web manager with
    valuable information. Without these log files, SAs and web managers are
    seriously hindered in their efforts to respond appropriately to suspicious or
    criminal actions targeted at the web site.

    <tt>/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</tt>, run the following command:
