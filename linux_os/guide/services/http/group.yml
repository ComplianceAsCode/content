title: 'Web Server'

description: |-
    The web server is responsible for providing access to
    content via the HTTP protocol. Web servers represent a significant
    security risk because:
    <br /><br />
    <ul>
    <li>The HTTP port is commonly probed by malicious sources</li>
    <li>Web server software is very complex, and includes a long
    history of vulnerabilities</li>
    <li>The HTTP protocol is unencrypted and vulnerable to passive
    monitoring</li>
    </ul>
    <br /><br />
    The system's default web server software is Apache 2 and is
    provided in the RPM package <tt>httpd</tt>.
