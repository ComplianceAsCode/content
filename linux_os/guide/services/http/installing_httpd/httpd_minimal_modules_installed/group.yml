title: 'Confirm Minimal Built-in Modules Installed'

description: |-
    The default <tt>httpd</tt> installation minimizes the number of
    modules that are compiled directly into the binary (<tt>core prefork http_core
    mod_so</tt>). This minimizes risk by limiting the capabilities allowed by the
    web server.

    Query the set of compiled-in modules using the following command:
    <pre>$ httpd -l</pre>
    If the number of compiled-in modules is significantly larger than the
    aforementioned set, this guide recommends re-installing <tt>httpd</tt> with a
    reduced configuration. Minimizing the number of modules that are compiled into
    the <tt>httpd</tt> binary, reduces risk by limiting the capabilities allowed by
    the webserver.
