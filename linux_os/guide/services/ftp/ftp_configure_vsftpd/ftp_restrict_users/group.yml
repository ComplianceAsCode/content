title: 'Restrict the Set of Users Allowed to Access FTP'

description: |-
    This section describes how to disable non-anonymous (password-based) FTP logins, or, if it is not possible to
    do this entirely due to legacy applications, how to restrict insecure FTP login to only those users who have an
    identified need for this access.
