title: 'Place the FTP Home Directory on its Own Partition'

description: |-
    By default, the anonymous FTP root is the home directory of the FTP user account. The df command can
    be used to verify that this directory is on its own partition.

rationale: |-
    If there is a mission-critical reason for anonymous users to upload files, precautions must be taken to prevent
    these users from filling a disk used by other services.
