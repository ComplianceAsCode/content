title: 'Remove ftp Package'

description: |-
    FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a traditional and widely used standard tool for
    transferring files between a server and clients over a network, especially where no
    authentication is necessary (permits anonymous users to connect to a server).
    <br/>
    {{{ describe_package_remove(package="ftp") }}}

rationale: |-
    FTP does not protect the confidentiality of data or authentication credentials. It
    is recommended SFTP be used if file transfer is required. Unless there is a need
    to run the system as a FTP server (for example, to allow anonymous downloads), it is
    recommended that the package be removed to reduce the potential attack surface.
