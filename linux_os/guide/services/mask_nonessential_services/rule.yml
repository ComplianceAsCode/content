title: 'Ensure nonessential services are removed or masked'

description: |-
    A network port is identified by its number, the associated IP address, 
    and the type of the communication protocol such as TCP or UDP.
    A listening port is a network port on which an application or process 
    listens on, acting as a communication endpoint.
    Each listening port can be open or closed (filtered) using a firewall. 
    In general terms, an open port is a network port that accepts 
    incoming packets from remote locations.

rationale:
    Services listening on the system pose a potential risk as an attack 
    vector. These services should be reviewed, and if not required, the 
    service should be stopped, and the package containing the service should 
    be removed. If required packages have a dependency, the service should 
    be stopped and masked to reduce the attack surface of the system.

    Run the following command:
    <pre># lsof -i -P -n | grep -v "(ESTABLISHED)"</pre>
    Review the output to ensure that all services listed are required 
    on the system. If a listed service is not required, remove the 
    package containing the service. If the package containing the 
    service is required, stop and mask the service
