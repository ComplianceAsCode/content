title: 'Network Routing'

description: "A router is a very desirable target for a\npotential adversary because they fulfill a variety of \ninfrastructure networking roles such as access to network segments,\ngateways to other networks, filtering, etc. Therefore, if one is\nrequired, the system acting as a router should be dedicated\nto that purpose alone and be stored in a physically secure\nlocation. The system's default routing software is Quagga, and\nprovided in an RPM package of the same name."
