title: 'SNMP Server'

description: |-
    The Simple Network Management Protocol allows
    administrators to monitor the state of network devices, including
    computers. Older versions of SNMP were well-known for weak
    security, such as plaintext transmission of the community string
    (used for authentication) and usage of easily-guessable
    choices for the community string.
