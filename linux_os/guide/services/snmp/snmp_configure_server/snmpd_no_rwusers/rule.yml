title: 'Ensure SNMP Read Write is disabled'

description: |-
    Edit <tt>/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf</tt>, remove any <tt>rwuser</tt> entries.
    Once the read write users have been removed, restart the SNMP service:
    <pre>$ sudo service snmpd restart</pre>

rationale: |-
    Certain SNMP settings can permit users to execute system behaviors from user
    writes to the community strings.
    This may permit a compromised account to execute commands on a remote system.

    There should be no output.
