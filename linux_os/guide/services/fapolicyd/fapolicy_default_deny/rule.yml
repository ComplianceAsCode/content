title: 'Configure Fapolicy Module to Employ a Deny-all, Permit-by-exception Policy to Allow the Execution of Authorized Software Programs.'

description: |-
    The Fapolicy module must be configured to employ a deny-all, permit-by-exception policy to allow the execution of authorized software programs and to prevent unauthorized software from running.

rationale: |-
    Utilizing a whitelist provides a configuration management method for allowing the execution of only authorized software.
    Using only authorized software decreases risk by limiting the number of potential vulnerabilities. Verification of whitelisted software occurs prior to execution or at system startup.

    Proceed with caution with enforcing the use of this daemon.
    Improper configuration may render the system non-functional.
    The "fapolicyd" API is not namespace aware and can cause issues when launching or running containers.

ocil_clause: 'fapolicyd is not running in enforcement mode with a deny-all, permit-by-exception policy'

ocil: |-
    Verify the {{{ full_name }}} "fapolicyd" employs a deny-all, permit-by-exception policy.

    Check that "fapolicyd" is in enforcement mode with the following command:

    $ sudo grep permissive /etc/fapolicyd/fapolicyd.conf

    permissive = 0

    Check that fapolicyd employs a deny-all policy on system mounts with the following command:

    $ sudo tail /etc/fapolicyd/fapolicyd.rules

    allow exe=/usr/bin/python3.7 : ftype=text/x-python
    deny_audit perm=any pattern=ld_so : all
    deny perm=any all : all

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to employ a deny-all, permit-by-exception application whitelisting policy with "fapolicyd".

    With the "fapolicyd" installed and enabled, configure the daemon to function in permissive mode until the whitelist is built correctly to avoid system lockout. Do this by editing the "/etc/fapolicyd/fapolicyd.conf" file with the following line:

    permissive = 1

    Build the whitelist in the "/etc/fapolicyd/fapolicyd.rules" file ensuring the last rule is "deny perm=any all : all".

    Once it is determined the whitelist is built correctly, set the fapolicyd to enforcing mode by editing the "permissive" line in the /etc/fapolicyd/fapolicyd.conf file.

    permissive = 0
