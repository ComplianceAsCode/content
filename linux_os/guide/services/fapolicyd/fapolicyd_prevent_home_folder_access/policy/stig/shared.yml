srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must limit the ability of non-privileged users to grant other users direct access to the contents of their home directories/folders.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Users' home directories/folders may contain information of a sensitive nature.
    Non-privileged users should coordinate any sharing of information with a System Administrator (SA) through shared resources.
    fapolicyd can confine users to their home directory, not allowing them to make any changes outside of their own home directories.
    Confining users to their home directory will minimize the risk of sharing information.

checktext: |-
    Verify that fapolicyd on {{{ full_name }}} prevents ability of non-privileged users to grant other users direct access to the contents of their home directories/folders.

    Run the following command:

    grep -r "deny_audit perm=chmod path=/home" /etc/fapolicyd/rules.d

fixtext: |-
    Configure fapolicyd to ability of non-privileged users to grant other users direct access to the contents of their home directories/folders.

    Add or edit the following lines in /etc/fapolicyd/rules.d/90-deny-home.

    deny_audit perm=chmod path=/home all : all

    Note: That fapolicyd must have correctly configured rules. All configurations will be based on the actual system setup and organizational polices and practices.
