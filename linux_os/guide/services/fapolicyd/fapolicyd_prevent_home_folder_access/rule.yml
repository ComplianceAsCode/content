title: 'fapolicyd Must be Configured to Limit Access to Users Home Folders'

description:
    fapolicyd needs be configured so that users cannot give access to their home folders to other users.

rationale: |-
    Users' home directories/folders may contain information of a sensitive nature.
    Non-privileged users should coordinate any sharing of information with a System Administrator (SA) through shared resources.
    fapolicyd can confine users to their home directory, not allowing them to make any changes outside of their own home directories.
    Confining users to their home directory will minimize the risk of sharing information.
