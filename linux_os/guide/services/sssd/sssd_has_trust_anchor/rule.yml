title: 'SSSD Has a Correct Trust Anchor'

severity: medium

description: |-
  SSSD must have acceptable trust anchor present.

rationale: |-
  Without path validation, an informed trust decision by the relying party cannot be made when
  presented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted.

  A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public key and associated data. It
  is used in the context of public key infrastructures, X.509 digital certificates, and DNSSEC.

  When there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor;
  it can be, for example, a Certification Authority (CA). A certification path starts with the
  subject certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted
  root certificate, typically issued by a trusted CA.

  This requirement verifies that a certification path to an accepted trust anchor is used for
  certificate validation and that the path includes status information. Path validation is
  necessary for a relying party to make an informed trust decision when presented with any
  certificate not already explicitly trusted. Status information for certification paths includes
  certificate revocation lists or online certificate status protocol responses.
  Validation of the certificate status information is out of scope for this requirement.
