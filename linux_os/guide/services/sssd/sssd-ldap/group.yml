description: |-
    The System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) is a system daemon that provides access
    to different identity and authentication providers such as Red Hat's IdM, Microsoft's AD,
    openLDAP, MIT Kerberos, etc. It uses a common framework that can provide caching and offline
    support to systems utilizing SSSD. SSSD using caching to reduce load on authentication
    servers permit offline authentication as well as store extended user data.
    <br /><br />
    SSSD can support many backends including LDAP. The <tt>sssd-ldap</tt> backend
    allows SSSD to fetch identity information from an LDAP server.
