title: 'Enable Smartcards in SSSD'

description: |-
    SSSD should be configured to authenticate access to the system
    using smart cards. To enable smart cards in SSSD, set <tt>pam_cert_auth</tt>
    to <tt>true</tt> under the <tt>[pam]</tt>
    section in <tt>/etc/sssd/sssd.conf</tt>. For example:
    <pre>[pam]
    pam_cert_auth = true
    </pre>

rationale: |-
    Using an authentication device, such as a CAC or token that is separate from
    the information system, ensures that even if the information system is
    compromised, that compromise will not affect credentials stored on the
    authentication device.
    <br /><br />
    Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from
    information systems gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens
    providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such
    as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD Common
    Access Card.

ocil_clause: 'smart cards are not enabled in SSSD'

ocil: |-
    To verify that smart cards are enabled in SSSD, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep pam_cert_auth /etc/sssd/sssd.conf</pre>
    If configured properly, output should be
    <pre>pam_cert_auth = true</pre>
