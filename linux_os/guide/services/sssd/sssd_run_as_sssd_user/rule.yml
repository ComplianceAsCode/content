ocil: |-
    To verify that SSSD is configured to run as user sssd, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep -r '\buser\b' /etc/sssd</pre>
    If configured properly, output should similar to <pre>/etc/sssd/conf.d/ospp.conf:user = sssd</pre>.
    Sanity of SSSD configuration in general can be checked using <pre>$ sudo sssctl config-check</pre>
