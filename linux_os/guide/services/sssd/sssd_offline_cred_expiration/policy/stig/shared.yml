    {{{ full_name }}} Must Prohibit The Use Of Cached Authenticators After One Day.

vuldiscussion: |-
    If cached authentication information is out-of-date, the validity of the authentication information may be questionable.

checktext: |-
    Verify that the SSSD prohibits the use of cached authentications after one day.

    Note: If smart card authentication is not being used on the system this item is Not Applicable.

    Check that SSSD allows cached authentications with the following command:

    $ sudo grep cache_credentials /etc/sssd/sssd.conf

    cache_credentials = true

    If "cache_credentials" is set to "false" or missing from the configuration file, this is not a finding and no further checks are required.

    If "cache_credentials" is set to "true", check that SSSD prohibits the use of cached authentications after one day with the following command:

    $ sudo grep offline_credentials_expiration  /etc/sssd/sssd.conf

    offline_credentials_expiration = 1

    If "offline_credentials_expiration" is not set to a value of "1", this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the SSSD to prohibit the use of cached authentications after one day.
    Add or change the following line in "/etc/sssd/sssd.conf" just below the line [pam]:
    offline_credentials_expiration = 1
