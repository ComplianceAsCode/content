title: 'Use direct-lvm with the Device Mapper Storage Driver'

description: |-
    To use Docker in production with the device mapper storage driver, the Docker
    daemon should be configured to use direct-lvm instead of loopback device as
    a storage. For setting up the LVM and configuring Docker, see the
    {{{ weblink(link="https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/device-mapper-driver/", text="Docker Device Mapper Storage Documentation") }}}.

rationale: |-
    For using Docker in production, the device mapper storage driver with loopback
    devices is discouraged. The suggested way of configuring device mapper storage
    driver is direct-lvm. Choosing the right storage driver and backing filesystem
    is crucial to stability and performance.
