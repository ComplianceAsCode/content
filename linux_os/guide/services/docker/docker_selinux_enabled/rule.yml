title: 'Ensure SELinux support is enabled in Docker'

description: |-
    To enable the SELinux for the Docker service, the Docker service must be
    configured to run the Docker daemon with <tt>--selinux-enabled</tt> option.
    In <tt>/etc/sysconfig/docker</tt> configuration file, add or correct
    the following line to enable SELinux support in the Docker daemon:
    <pre>OPTIONS='--selinux-enabled'</pre>

rationale: |-
    If SELinux is not explicitely enabled in the Docker daemon configuration,
    Docker does not use SELinux which means Docker runs unconfined,
    and SELinux will not provide security separation for Docker container
    processes. However enabling SELinux for the Docker service prevents
    an attacker or rogue container from attacking other container processes
    and content as well as prevents taking over the host operating system.
