title: 'Avahi Server'

description: |-
    The Avahi daemon implements the DNS Service Discovery
    and Multicast DNS protocols, which provide service and host
    discovery on a network. It allows a system to automatically
    identify resources on the network, such as printers or web servers.
    This capability is also known as mDNSresponder and is a major part
    of Zeroconf networking.
