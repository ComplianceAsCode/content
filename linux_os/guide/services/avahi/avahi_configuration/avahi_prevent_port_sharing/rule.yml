title: 'Prevent Other Programs from Using Avahi''s Port'

description: |-
    To prevent other mDNS stacks from running, edit <tt>/etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf</tt>
    and ensure the following line appears in the <tt>[server]</tt> section:
    <pre>disallow-other-stacks=yes</pre>

rationale: |-
    This helps ensure that only Avahi is responsible for mDNS traffic coming from
    that port on the system.
