title: 'Check Avahi Responses'' TTL Field'

description: |-
    To make Avahi ignore packets unless the TTL field is 255, edit
    <tt>/etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf</tt> and ensure the following line
    appears in the <tt>[server]</tt> section:
    <pre>check-response-ttl=yes</pre>

rationale: |-
    This helps to ensure that only mDNS responses from the local network are
    processed, because the TTL field in a packet is decremented from its initial
    value of 255 whenever it is routed from one network to another. Although a
    properly-configured router or firewall should not allow mDNS packets into
    the local network at all, this option provides another check to ensure they
    are not permitted.
