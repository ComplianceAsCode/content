title: 'Restrict Information Published by Avahi'

description: |-
    If it is necessary to publish some information to the network, it should not be joined
    by any extraneous information, or by information supplied by a non-trusted source
    on the system.
    Prevent user applications from using Avahi to publish services by adding or
    correcting the following line in the <tt>[publish]</tt> section:
    <pre>disable-user-service-publishing=yes</pre>
    Implement as many of the following lines as possible, to restrict the information
    published by Avahi.
    <pre>publish-addresses=no
    publish-hinfo=no
    publish-workstation=no
    publish-domain=no</pre>
    Inspect the files in the directory <tt>/etc/avahi/services/</tt>. Unless there
    is an operational need to publish information about each of these services,
    delete the corresponding file.

rationale: |-
    These options prevent publishing attempts from succeeding,
    and can be applied even if publishing is disabled entirely via
    disable-publishing. Alternatively, these can be used to restrict
    the types of published information in the event that some information
    must be published.
