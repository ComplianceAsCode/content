title: 'Disable Kerberos by removing host keytab'

description: |-
    Kerberos is not an approved key distribution method for
    Common Criteria. To prevent using Kerberos by system daemons,
    remove the Kerberos keytab files, especially
    <tt>/etc/krb5.keytab</tt>.

rationale: |-
    The key derivation function (KDF) in Kerberos is not FIPS compatible.

ocil_clause: 'a keytab file is present on the system'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command to see if there are some keytabs
    that would potentially allow the use of Kerberos by system daemons.
    <pre>$ ls -la /etc/*.keytab</pre>
    The expected result is
    <pre>ls: cannot access '/etc/*.keytab': No such file or directory</pre>

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to prevent system daemons from using Kerberos for authentication.

    Remove any files with the .keytab extension from the operating system.
    rm -f /etc/*.keytab
