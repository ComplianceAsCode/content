title: 'Disable Kerberos by removing host keytab'

description: |-
    Kerberos is not an approved key distribution method for
    Common Criteria. To prevent using Kerberos by system daemons,
    remove the Kerberos keytab files, especially
    <tt>/etc/krb5.keytab</tt>.

rationale: |-
    The key derivation function (KDF) in Kerberos is not FIPS compatible.

ocil: |-
    Run the following command to see if there are some keytabs
    that would potentially allow the use of Kerberos by system daemons.
    <pre>$ ls -la /etc/*.keytab</pre>
    The expected result is
    <pre>ls: cannot access '/etc/*.keytab': No such file or directory</pre>
