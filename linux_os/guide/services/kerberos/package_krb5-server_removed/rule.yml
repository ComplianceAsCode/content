title: 'Remove the Kerberos Server Package'

description: |-
    The <tt>krb5-server</tt> package should be removed if not in use.
    Is this system the Kerberos server? If not, remove the package.
    {{{ describe_package_remove(package="krb5-server") }}}
    The krb5-server RPM is not installed by default on a {{{ full_name }}}
    system. It is needed only by the Kerberos servers, not by the
    clients which use Kerberos for authentication. If the system is not
    intended for use as a Kerberos Server it should be removed.

rationale: |-
    Unnecessary packages should not be installed to decrease the attack
    surface of the system.  While this software is clearly essential on an KDC
    server, it is not necessary on typical desktop or workstation systems.
