title: 'Configure System to Forward All Mail From Postmaster to The Root Account'

description: |-
    Verify the administrators are notified in the event of an audit processing failure.
    Check that the "/etc/aliases" file has a defined value for "root".
    <pre>$ sudo grep "postmaster:\s*root$" /etc/aliases

    postmaster: root</pre>

rationale: |-
    It is critical for the appropriate personnel to be aware if a system is at risk of failing to
    process audit logs as required. Without this notification, the security personnel may be
    unaware of an impending failure of the audit capability, and system operation may be adversely
    affected.
    
    Audit processing failures include software/hardware errors, failures in the audit capturing
    mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded.
