title: 'Configure System to Forward All Mail through a specific host'

description: |-
    Set up a relay host that will act as a gateway for all outbound email.
    Edit the file <tt>/etc/postfix/main.cf</tt> to ensure that only the following
    <tt>relayhost</tt> line appears:
    <pre>relayhost = {{{ xccdf_value("var_postfix_relayhost") }}}</pre>

rationale: |-
    A central outbound email location ensures messages sent from any network host
    can be audited for potential unexpected content.  Tooling on the central server
    may help prevent spam or viruses from being delivered.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: 'it is not'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command to ensure postfix routes mail to this system:
    <pre>$ grep relayhost /etc/postfix/main.cf</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should show only <tt>{{{ xccdf_value("var_postfix_relayhost") }}}</tt>.
