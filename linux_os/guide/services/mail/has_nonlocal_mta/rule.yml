title: 'Ensure Mail Transfer Agent is not Listening on any non-loopback Address'

description: |-
    Mail Transfer Agents (MTA), such as sendmail and Postfix, are used to
    listen for incoming mail and transfer the messages to the appropriate
    user or mail server. If the system is not intended to be a mail server,
    it is recommended that the MTA be configured to only process local mail.

rationale: |-
    The software for all Mail Transfer Agents is complex and most have a
    long history of security issues. While it is important to ensure that
    the system can process local mail messages, it is not necessary to have
    the MTA's daemon listening on a port unless the server is intended to
    be a mail server that receives and processes mail from other systems.

ocil_clause: 'MTA is listening on any non-loopback address'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command to verify that the MTA is not listening on
    any non-loopback address (127.0.0.1 or ::1).
    <pre># ss -lntu | grep -E ':25\s' | grep -E -v '\s(127.0.0.1|::1):25\s'</pre>
    Nothing should be returned
