title: 'Enact SMTP Recipient Restrictions'

description: |-
    To configure Postfix to restrict addresses to which it
    will send mail, see:
    {{{ weblink(link="http://www.postfix.org/SMTPD_ACCESS_README.html#danger") }}}
    <br />
    The full contents of <tt>smtpd_recipient_restrictions</tt> will
    vary by site, since this is a common place to put spam restrictions and other
    site-specific options. The <tt>permit_mynetworks</tt> option allows all mail to
    be relayed from the systems in <tt>mynetworks</tt>. Then, the
    <tt>reject_unauth_destination</tt> option denies all mail whose destination
    address is not local, preventing any other systems from relaying. These two
    options should always appear in this order, and should usually follow one
    another immediately unless SMTP AUTH is used.
