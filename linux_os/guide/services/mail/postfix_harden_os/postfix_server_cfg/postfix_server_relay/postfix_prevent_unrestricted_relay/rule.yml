title: 'Prevent Unrestricted Mail Relaying'

description: |-
    Modify the <pre>/etc/postfix/main.cf</pre> file to restrict client connections
    to the local network with the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo postconf -e 'smtpd_client_restrictions = permit_mynetworks,reject'</pre>

rationale: |-
    If unrestricted mail relaying is permitted, unauthorized senders could use this
    host as a mail relay for the purpose of sending spam or other unauthorized
    activity.

    To verify the system is configured to prevent unrestricted mail relaying,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo postconf -n smtpd_client_restrictions</pre>
    The output should return:
    <pre>smtpd_client_restrictions = permit_mynetworks,reject</pre>
