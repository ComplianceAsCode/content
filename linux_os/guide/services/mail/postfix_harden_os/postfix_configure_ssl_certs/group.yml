title: 'Configure SSL Certificates for Use with SMTP AUTH'

description: |-
    If SMTP AUTH is to be used, the use of SSL to protect credentials in transit is strongly recommended.
    There are also configurations for which it may be desirable to encrypt all mail in transit from one MTA to another,
    though such configurations are beyond the scope of this guide. In either event, the steps for creating and installing
    an SSL certificate are independent of the MTA in use, and are described here.
