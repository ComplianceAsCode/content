title: 'Allow IMAP Clients to Access the Server'

description: |-
    The default iptables configuration does not allow inbound access to any services.
    This modification will allow remote hosts to initiate connections to the IMAP daemon,
    while keeping all other ports on the server in their default protected state.
    {{{ describe_iptables_allow(proto="tcp", port=143) }}}
