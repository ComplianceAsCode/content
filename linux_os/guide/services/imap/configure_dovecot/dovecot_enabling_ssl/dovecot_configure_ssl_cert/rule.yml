title: 'Configure Dovecot to Use the SSL Certificate file'

description: |-
    This option tells Dovecot where to find the mail server's SSL
    Certificate.
    <br /><br />
    Edit <tt>/etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-ssl.conf</tt> and add or correct the
    following line (<i>note: the path below is the default path set by the
    Dovecot installation. If you are using a different path, ensure you
    reference the appropriate file</i>):
    <pre>ssl_cert = &lt;/etc/pki/dovecot/certs/dovecot.pem</pre>"

rationale: |-
    SSL certificates are used by the client to authenticate the identity of the
    server, as well as to encrypt credentials and message traffic. Not using
    SSL to encrypt mail server traffic could allow unauthorized access to
    credentials and mail messages since they are sent in plain text over the
    network.
