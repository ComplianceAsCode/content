title: 'Enable SSL Support'

description: "SSL should be used to encrypt network traffic between the \nDovecot server and its clients. Users must authenticate to the Dovecot \nserver in order to read their mail, and passwords should never be \ntransmitted in clear text. In addition, protecting mail as it is \ndownloaded is a privacy measure, and clients may use SSL certificates \nto authenticate the server, preventing another system from impersonating \nthe server."
