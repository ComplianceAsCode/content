title: "Remove the X Windows Xwayland Package"

description: |-
    {{{ describe_package_remove("xorg-x11-server-Xwayland") }}}

rationale: |-
    Unnecessary service packages must not be installed to decrease the attack
    surface of the system. X Windows has a long history of security
    vulnerabilities and should not be installed unless approved and documented.
    Unless your organization specifically requires graphical login access via
    X Windows, remove it to reduce the potential attack surface.
