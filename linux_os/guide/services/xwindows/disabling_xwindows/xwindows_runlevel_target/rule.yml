title: 'Disable X Windows Startup By Setting Default Target'

description: |-
    Systems that do not require a graphical user interface should only boot by
    default into <tt>multi-user.target</tt> mode. This prevents accidental booting of the system
    into a <tt>graphical.target</tt> mode. Setting the system's default target to
    <tt>multi-user.target</tt> will prevent automatic startup of the X server. To do so, run:
    <pre>$ systemctl set-default multi-user.target</pre>
    You should see the following output:
    <pre>rm '/etc/systemd/system/default.target'
    ln -s '/usr/lib/systemd/system/multi-user.target' '/etc/systemd/system/default.target'</pre>

rationale: |-
    Services that are not required for system and application processes
    must not be active to decrease the attack surface of the system. X windows has a
    long history of security vulnerabilities and should not be used unless approved
    and documented.

ocil_clause: 'the X windows display server is running and/or has not been disabled'

ocil: |-
    To verify the default target is multi-user, run the following command:
    <pre>$ systemctl get-default</pre>
    The output should show the following:
    <pre>multi-user.target</pre>
