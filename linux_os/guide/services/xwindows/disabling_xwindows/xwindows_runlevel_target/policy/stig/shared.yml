    The graphical display manager must not be the default target on {{{ full_name }}} unless approved.

    Unnecessary service packages must not be installed to decrease the attack surface of the system.
    Graphical display managers have a long history of security vulnerabilities and must not be used, unless approved and documented.

    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} is configured to boot to the command line:

    $ systemctl get-default

    multi-user.target

    If the system default target is not set to "multi-user.target" and the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) lacks a documented requirement for a graphical user interface, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Document the requirement for a graphical user interface with the ISSO or set the default target to multi-user with the following command:

    $ sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target
