    Unnecessary service packages must not be installed to decrease the attack surface of the system. X windows has a long history of security
    vulnerabilities and should not be installed unless approved and documented.

checktext: |-
    To ensure the X Windows package group is removed, run the following command:

     $ rpm -qi xorg-x11-server-Xorg xorg-x11-server-common xorg-x11-server-utils xorg-x11-server-Xwayland

    For each "package" mentioned above you should receive following line:
     package &lt;package&gt; is not installed

    If xorg related packages are not removed and run level is not correctly configured, then this is a finding.
