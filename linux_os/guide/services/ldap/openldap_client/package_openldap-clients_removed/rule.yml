title: 'Ensure LDAP client is not installed'

description: |-
    The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a service that provides
    a method for looking up information from a central database.
    {{{ describe_package_remove( package_name ) }}}


rationale:
    If the system does not need to act as an LDAP client, it is recommended that the software is
    removed to reduce the potential attack surface.
