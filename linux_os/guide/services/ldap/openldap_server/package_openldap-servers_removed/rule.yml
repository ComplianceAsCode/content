title: 'Uninstall openldap-servers Package'

description: |-
    The <tt>openldap-servers</tt> package should be removed if not in use.
    Is this system the OpenLDAP server? If not, remove the package.
    {{{ describe_package_remove(package="openldap-servers") }}}
    The openldap-servers RPM is not installed by default on a {{{ full_name }}}
    system. It is needed only by the OpenLDAP server, not by the
    clients which use LDAP for authentication. If the system is not
    intended for use as an LDAP Server it should be removed.

rationale: |-
    Unnecessary packages should not be installed to decrease the attack
    surface of the system.  While this software is clearly essential on an LDAP
    server, it is not necessary on typical desktop or workstation systems.
