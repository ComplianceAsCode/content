title: 'Disable SSH Server If Possible (Unusual)'

description: |-
    The SSH server service, sshd, is commonly needed.
    However, if it can be disabled, do so.
    <systemd-service-macro enable="false" service="sshd" />
    This is unusual, as SSH is a common method for encrypted and authenticated
    remote access.
