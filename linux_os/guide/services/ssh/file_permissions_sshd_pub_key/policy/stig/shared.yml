    {{{ full_name }}} SSH public host key files must have mode 0644 or less permissive.

    If a public host key file is modified by an unauthorized user, the SSH service
    may be compromised.

checktext: |-
    Verify the SSH public host key files have a mode of "0644" or less permissive with the following command:

    Note: SSH public key files may be found in other directories on the system depending on the installation.

    $ sudo stat -c "%a %n" /etc/ssh/*.pub

    644 /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key.pub
    644 /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub
    644 /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub
    644 /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub

    If any key.pub file has a mode more permissive than "0644", this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Change the mode of public host key files under "/etc/ssh" to "0644" with the following command:

    $ sudo chmod 0644 /etc/ssh/*key.pub

    Restart the SSH daemon for the changes to take effect:

    $ sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
