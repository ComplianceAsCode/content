title: 'Remove SSH Server iptables Firewall exception (Unusual)'

description: |-
    By default, inbound connections to SSH's port are allowed. If the SSH
    server is not being used, this exception should be removed from the
    firewall configuration.
    <br /><br />
    Edit the files <tt>/etc/sysconfig/iptables</tt> and
    <tt>/etc/sysconfig/ip6tables</tt> (if IPv6 is in use). In each file, locate
    and delete the line:
    <pre>-A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT</pre>
    This is unusual, as SSH is a common method for encrypted and authenticated
    remote access.

rationale: |-
    If inbound SSH connections are not expected, disallowing access to the SSH
    port will avoid possible exploitation of the port by an attacker.
