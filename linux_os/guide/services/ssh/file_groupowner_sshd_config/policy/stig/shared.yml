    The {{{ full_name }}} SSH server configuration file must be group-owned by root.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Service configuration files enable or disable features of their respective
    services that if configured incorrectly can lead to insecure and vulnerable
    configurations. Therefore, service configuration files should be owned by the
    correct group to prevent unauthorized changes.

    Verify the group ownership of the "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" file with the following command:

    $ ls -al /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    rw-------. 1 root root 3669 Feb 22 11:34 /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    If the "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" file does not have a group owner of "root", this is a finding.

    Configure the "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" file to be group-owned by root with the following command:

    $ sudo chgrp root /etc/ssh/sshd_config
