    {{{ full_name }}} SSH private host key files must have mode 0600 or less permissive.

vuldiscussion: |-
    If an unauthorized user obtains the private SSH host key file, the host could be
    impersonated.

checktext: |-
    Verify the SSH private host key files have a mode of "0600" or less permissive with the following command:

    $ ls -l /etc/ssh/*_key

    600 /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
    600 /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
    600 /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
    600 /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key

    If any private host key file has a mode more permissive than "0600", this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the mode of SSH private host key files under "/etc/ssh" to "0600" with the following command:

    $ sudo chmod 0600 /etc/ssh/ssh_host*key

    Restart the SSH daemon for the changes to take effect:

    $ sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
