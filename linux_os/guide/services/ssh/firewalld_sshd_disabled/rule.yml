title: 'Remove SSH Server firewalld Firewall exception (Unusual)'

description: |-
    By default, inbound connections to SSH's port are allowed. If
    the SSH server is not being used, this exception should be removed from the
    firewall configuration.
    <br /><br />
    {{{ describe_firewalld_prevent_service(service="ssh") }}}

rationale: |-
    If inbound SSH connections are not expected, disallowing access to the SSH port will
    avoid possible exploitation of the port by an attacker.
