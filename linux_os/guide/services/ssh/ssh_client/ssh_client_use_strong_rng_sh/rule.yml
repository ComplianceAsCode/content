title: 'SSH client uses strong entropy to seed (Bash-like shells)'

description: |-
    To set up SSH client to use entropy from a high-quality source, make sure
    that the appropriate shell environment variable is configured. The
    <tt>SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG</tt> environment variable determines how many bytes
    of entropy to use. Make sure that the file
    <tt>/etc/profile.d/cc-ssh-strong-rng.sh</tt> contains line
    <pre>export SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG=32</pre>.

rationale: |-
    Some SSH implementations use the openssl library for entropy, which by default, doesn't use high-entropy sources.
    Randomness is needed to generate considerably more secure data-encryption keys. Plaintext padding, initialization vectors
    in encryption algorithms, and high-quality entropy eliminates the possibility that the output of
    the random number generator used by SSH would be known to potential attackers.

ocil_clause: 'SSH client is not configured to use 32 bytes of entropy or more'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command to verify that SSH client is configured to use 32 bytes of entropy:
    <pre>grep SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG /etc/profile.d/cc-ssh-strong-rng.sh</pre>
    The output should be:
    <pre>export SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG=32</pre>
