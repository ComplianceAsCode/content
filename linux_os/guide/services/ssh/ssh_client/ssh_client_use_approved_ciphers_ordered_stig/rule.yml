title: 'Use Only FIPS 140-3 Validated Ciphers in SSH Client Configuration'

description: |-
    Limit the ciphers to those algorithms which are FIPS-approved.
    The following line in <tt>/etc/ssh/ssh_config</tt>
    demonstrates use of FIPS-approved ciphers:
    {{%- if 'ubuntu' in product %}}
    <pre>Ciphers {{{ ssh_approved_ciphers }}}</pre>
    If this line does not contain these ciphers in exact order,
    is commented out, or is missing, this is a finding.
    {{%- endif %}}

rationale: |-
    Unapproved mechanisms that are used for authentication to the cryptographic module are not verified and therefore
    cannot be relied upon to provide confidentiality or integrity, and system data may be compromised.
    <br />
    Operating systems utilizing encryption are required to use FIPS-compliant mechanisms for authenticating to
    cryptographic modules.
    <br />
    FIPS 140-3 is the current standard for validating that mechanisms used to access cryptographic modules
    utilize authentication that meets industry and government requirements. For government systems, this allows
    Security Levels 1, 2, 3, or 4 for use on {{{ full_name }}}.
