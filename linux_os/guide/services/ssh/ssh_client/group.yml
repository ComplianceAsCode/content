title: 'Configure OpenSSH Client if Necessary'

description: |-
    The following configuration changes apply to the SSH client. They can
    improve security parameters relwevant to the client user, e.g. increasing
    entropy while generating initialization vectors. Note that these changes
    influence only the default SSH client configuration. Changes in this group
    can be overridden by the client user by modifying files within the
    <pre>~/.ssh</pre> directory or by supplying parameters on the command line.
