title: 'Use Only FIPS 140-3 Validated MACs'

description: |-
    Limit the MACs to those hash algorithms which are FIPS-approved.
    The following line in <tt>/etc/ssh/ssh_config</tt>
    demonstrates use of FIPS-approved MACs:

    <pre>MACs {{{ ssh_approved_macs }}}</pre>
    If this line does not contain these MACs in exact order,
    is commented out, or is missing, this is a finding.

rationale: |-
    DoD Information Systems are required to use FIPS-approved cryptographic hash
    functions. The only hash algorithms meeting this requirement is SHA2.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: 'MACs option is commented out or not using FIPS-approved hash algorithms'

ocil: |-
    Only FIPS-approved MACs should be used. To verify that only FIPS-approved
    MACs are in use, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep -ir macs /etc/ssh/ssh_config*</pre>
    The output should contain only following MACs:
    <pre>MACs {{{ xccdf_value("ssh_approved_macs") }}}</pre>

warnings:
    - general: |-
        The system needs to be rebooted for these changes to take effect.
