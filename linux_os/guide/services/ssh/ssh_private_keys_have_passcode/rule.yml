title: 'OpenSSH Service Must Use Passcode for Their Private Keys'

description: |-
    Verify the SSH private key files have a passcode.
    For each private key stored on the system, use the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo ssh-keygen -y -f /path/to/file</pre>

    If the contents of the key are displayed, without asking a passphrase this is a finding.

rationale: |-
    If an unauthorized user obtains access to a private key without a passcode, that user would
    have unauthorized access to any system where the associated public key has been installed.
