    This ensures a user login will be terminated as soon as the "ClientAliveInterval"
    is reached.

checktext: |-
    To ensure "ClientAliveInterval" is set correctly, run the following command:

     $ sudo grep ClientAliveCountMax /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf

    If properly configured, the output should be:
     ClientAliveCountMax 0

    In this case, the SSH idle timeout occurs precisely when
    the "ClientAliveInterval" is set.

    If it is commented out or not configured properly, then this is a finding.
