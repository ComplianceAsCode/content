title: 'Set strong key exchange algorithm'

description: |-
    Key exchange is any method in cryptography by which cryptographic 
    keys are exchanged between two parties, allowing use of a cryptographic 
    algorithm. If the sender and receiver wish to exchange encrypted messages, 
    each must be equipped to encrypt messages to be sent and decrypt messages received

rationale: |-
    Key exchange methods that are considered weak should be removed. A key exchange
    method may be weak because too few bits are used, or the hashing algorithm is considered
    too weak. Using weak algorithms could expose connections to man-in-the-middle attacks

ocil_clause: 'Weak Key Exchange Algorithm is being used'

ocil: |-
    The following should not be used

    Only FIPS ciphers should be used. To verify that only FIPS-approved
    ciphers are in use, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep Ciphers /etc/ssh/sshd_config</pre>
    The output should contain only those ciphers which are FIPS-approved.

warnings:
    - general: |-
        Some organizations may have stricter requirements for approved Key exchange
        algorithms. Ensure that Key exchange algorithms used are in compliance with site
        policy.
        The only Key Exchange Algorithms currently FIPS 140-2 approved are: 
        ecdh-sha2-nistp256,ecdh-sha2-nistp384,ecdh-sha2-nistp521,
