    {{{ full_name }}} SSHD must not allow blank passwords.

vuldiscussion: |-
    If an account has an empty password, anyone could log on and run commands with the privileges of that account. Accounts with empty passwords should never be used in operational environments.

    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} remote access using SSH prevents logging on with a blank password with the following command:

    $ sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -dd 2&gt;&1 | awk '/filename/ {print $4}' | tr -d '\r' | tr '' ' ' | xargs sudo grep -iH '^\s*permitemptypasswords'

    PermitEmptyPassword no

    If the "PermitEmptyPassword" keyword is set to "yes", is missing, or is commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    To configure the system to prevent SSH users from logging on with blank passwords edit the following line in "etc/ssh/sshd_config":

    PermitEmptyPasswords no

    Restart the SSH daemon for the settings to take effect:

    $ sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
