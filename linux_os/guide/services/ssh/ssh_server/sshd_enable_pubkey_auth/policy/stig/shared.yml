    {{{ full_name }}} SSHD must accept public key authentication.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Without the use of multifactor authentication, the ease of access to
    privileged functions is greatly increased. Multifactor authentication
    requires using two or more factors to achieve authentication.
    A privileged account is defined as an information system account with
    authorizations of a privileged user.
    The DoD CAC with DoD-approved PKI is an example of multifactor
    authentication.

    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} SSH daemon accepts public key encryption with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -i PubkeyAuthentication /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    PubkeyAuthentication yes

    If "PubkeyAuthentication" is set to no, the line is commented out, or the line is missing, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    To configure the system add or modify the following line in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config".

    PubkeyAuthentication yes

    Restart the SSH daemon for the settings to take effect:

    $ sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
