    {{{ full_name }}} SSHD must accept public key authentication.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Without the use of multifactor authentication, the ease of access to privileged functions is greatly increased. Multifactor authentication requires using two or more factors to achieve authentication. A privileged account is defined as an information system account with authorizations of a privileged user. A DOD common access card (CAC) with DOD-approved PKI is an example of multifactor authentication.

    Note: If the system administrator demonstrates the use of an approved alternate multifactor authentication method, this requirement is Not Applicable.

    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} SSH daemon accepts public key encryption with the following command:

    $ sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -dd 2&gt;&1 | awk '/filename/ {print $4}' | tr -d '\r' | tr '\n' ' ' | xargs sudo grep -iH '^\s*pubkeyauthentication'

    PubkeyAuthentication yes

    If "PubkeyAuthentication" is set to no, the line is commented out, or the line is missing, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    To configure the system, add or modify the following line in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" or in a file in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d".

    PubkeyAuthentication yes

    Restart the SSH daemon for the settings to take effect:

    $ sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
