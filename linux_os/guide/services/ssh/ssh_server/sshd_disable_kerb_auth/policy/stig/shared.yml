    The {{{ full_name }}} SSH daemon must not allow Kerberos authentication.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Kerberos authentication for SSH is often implemented using GSSAPI. If Kerberos
    is enabled through SSH, the SSH daemon provides a means of access to the
    system's Kerberos implementation. Vulnerabilities in the system's Kerberos
    implementations may be subject to exploitation.

checktext: |-
    Verify the SSH daemon does not allow Kerberos authentication with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -i kerberosauth  /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*

    KerberosAuthentication no

    If the value is returned as "yes", the returned line is commented out, no output is returned, and the use of Kerberos authenitcation has not been documented with the ISSO, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the SSH daemon to not allow Kerberos authentication.

    Add the following line in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config", or uncomment the line and set the value to "no":

    KerberosAuthentication no

    The SSH service must be restarted for changes to take effect:

    $ sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
