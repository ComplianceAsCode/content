title: 'Use Only FIPS 140-2 Validated Ciphers'

description: |-
    Limit the ciphers to those algorithms which are FIPS-approved.
    The following line in <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt>
    demonstrates use of FIPS-approved ciphers:
    <pre>Ciphers aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr</pre>
    This rule ensures that there are configured ciphers mentioned
    above (or their subset), keeping the given order of algorithms.

rationale: |-
    Unapproved mechanisms that are used for authentication to the cryptographic module are not verified and therefore
    cannot be relied upon to provide confidentiality or integrity, and system data may be compromised.
    <br />
    Operating systems utilizing encryption are required to use FIPS-compliant mechanisms for authenticating to
    cryptographic modules.
    <br />
    FIPS 140-2 is the current standard for validating that mechanisms used to access cryptographic modules
    utilize authentication that meets industry and government requirements. For government systems, this allows
    Security Levels 1, 2, 3, or 4 for use on {{{ full_name }}}.

ocil_clause: 'FIPS ciphers are not configured or the enabled ciphers are not FIPS-approved'

ocil: |-
    Only FIPS ciphers should be used. To verify that only FIPS-approved
    ciphers are in use, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep Ciphers /etc/ssh/sshd_config</pre>
    The output should contain only following ciphers (or a subset) in the exact order:
    <pre>aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr</pre>

warnings:
    - general: |-
        The system needs to be rebooted for these changes to take effect.
    - regulatory: |-
        System Crypto Modules must be provided by a vendor that undergoes
        FIPS-140 certifications.
        FIPS-140 is applicable to all Federal agencies that use
        cryptographic-based security systems to protect sensitive information
        in computer and telecommunication systems (including voice systems) as
        defined in Section 5131 of the Information Technology Management Reform
        Act of 1996, Public Law 104-106. This standard shall be used in
        designing and implementing cryptographic modules that Federal
        departments and agencies operate or are operated for them under
        contract. See <b>{{{ weblink(link="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf") }}}</b>
        To meet this, the system has to have cryptographic software provided by
        a vendor that has undergone this certification. This means providing
        documentation, test results, design information, and independent third
        party review by an accredited lab. While open source software is
        capable of meeting this, it does not meet FIPS-140 unless the vendor
        submits to this process.
