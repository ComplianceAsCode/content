    The {{{ full_name }}} SSH daemon must display the date and time of the last successful account logon upon an SSH logon.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Providing users feedback on when account accesses last occurred facilitates user recognition and reporting of unauthorized account use.

checktext: |-
    Verify the SSH daemon provides users with feedback on when account accesses last occurred with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -ir printlast  /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*

    PrintLastLog yes

    If the "PrintLastLog" keyword is set to "no", the returned line is commented out, or no output is returned, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the SSH daemon to provide users with feedback on when account accesses last occurred.

    PrintLastLog yes
