    {{{ full_name }}} SSH daemon must display the date and time of the last successful account logon upon an SSH logon.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Providing users feedback on when account accesses last occurred facilitates user recognition and reporting of unauthorized account use.

checktext: |-
    Verify the SSH daemon provides users with feedback on when account accesses last occurred with the following command:

    $ sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -dd 2&gt;&1 | awk '/filename/ {print $4}' | tr -d '\r' | tr '\n' ' ' | xargs sudo grep -iH '^\s*printlastlog'

    PrintLastLog yes

    If the "PrintLastLog" keyword is set to "no", the returned line is commented out, or no output is returned, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the SSH daemon to provide users with feedback on when account accesses last occurred.

    Add the following line to "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" or to a file in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d", or uncomment the line and set the value to "yes":

    PrintLastLog yes

    The SSH service must be restarted for changes to take effect:

    $ sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
