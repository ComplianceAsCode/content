title: 'Enable SSH Server firewalld Firewall Exception'

description: |-
    If the SSH server is in use, inbound connections to SSH's port should be allowed to permit
    remote access through SSH. In more restrictive firewalld settings, the SSH port should be
    added to the proper firewalld zone in order to allow SSH remote access.
    <br /><br />
    {{{ describe_firewalld_allow_service(service="ssh") }}}

rationale: |-
    If inbound SSH connections are expected, adding the SSH port to the proper firewalld zone
    will allow remote access through the SSH port.

warnings:
    - general: |-
        The remediation for this rule uses <tt>firewall-cmd</tt> and <tt>nmcli</tt> tools.
        Therefore, it will only be executed if <tt>firewalld</tt> and <tt>NetworkManager</tt>
        services are running. Otherwise, the remediation will be aborted and a informative message
        will be shown in the remediation report.
        These respective services will not be started in order to preserve any intentional change
        in network components related to firewall and network interfaces.
    - general: |-
        This rule also checks if the SSH port was modified by the administrator in the firewalld
        services definitions and is reflecting the expected port number. Although this is checked,
        fixing the custom ssh.xml file placed by the administrator at /etc/firewalld/services it
        is not in the scope of the remediation since there is no reliable way to manually change
        the respective file. If the default SSH port is modified, it is on the administrator
        responsibility to ensure the firewalld customizations in the service port level are
        properly configured.

        {{{ full_name }}} prefers and recommends to use NetworkManager keyfiles instead of the
        <tt>ifcfg</tt> files stored in <tt>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts</tt>. Therefore, if the
        system was upgraded from a previous release, make sure the NIC configuration files are
        properly migrated from <tt>ifcfg</tt> format to NetworkManager keyfiles. Otherwise, this
        rule won't be able to check the configuration. The migration can be accomplished by
        <tt>nmcli connection migrate</tt> command.
