title: 'Enable SSH Server firewalld Firewall exception'

description: |-
    By default, inbound connections to SSH's port are allowed. If
    the SSH server is being used but denied by the firewall, this exception should
    be added to the firewall configuration.
    <br /><br />
    {{{ describe_firewalld_allow(proto="tcp", service="ssh") }}}

rationale: |-
    If inbound SSH connections are expected, adding a firewall rule exception
    will allow remote access through the SSH port.
