    {{{ full_name }}} must not permit direct logons to the root account using remote access via SSH.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Even though the communications channel may be encrypted, an additional layer of
    security is gained by extending the policy of not logging directly on as root.
    In addition, logging in with a user-specific account provides individual
    accountability of actions performed on the system and also helps to minimize
    direct attack attempts on root's password.

    Verify {{{ full_name }}} remote access using SSH prevents users from logging on directly as "root" with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -i PermitRootLogin /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    PermitRootLogin no

    If the "PermitRootLogin" keyword is set to "yes", is missing, or is commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    To configure the system to prevent SSH users from logging on directly as root add or modify the following line in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config".

     PermitRootLogin no

    Restart the SSH daemon for the settings to take effect:

    $ sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
