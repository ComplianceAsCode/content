srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must ensure the SSH server uses strong entropy.

vuldiscussion: |-
    SSH implementation in {{{ full_name }}} uses the openssl library, which doesn't use high-entropy sources by default.
    Randomness is needed to generate data-encryption keys, and as plaintext padding and initialization vectors
    in encryption algorithms, and high-quality entropy elliminates the possibility that the output of
    the random number generator used by SSH would be known to potential attackers.

checktext: |-
    Verify the SSH server uses strong entropy with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -i ssh_use_strong_rng /etc/sysconfig/sshd

    SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG=32

    If the "SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG" line does not equal "32", is commented out or missing, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the operating system SSH server to use strong entropy.

    Add or modify the following line in the "/etc/sysconfig/sshd" file.

    SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG=32

    The SSH service must be restarted for changes to take effect:

    $ sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
