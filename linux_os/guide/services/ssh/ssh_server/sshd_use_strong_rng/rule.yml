title: 'SSH server uses strong entropy to seed'

description: |-
    To set up SSH server to use entropy from a high-quality source, edit the <tt>/etc/sysconfig/sshd</tt> file.
    The <tt>SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG</tt> configuration value determines how many bytes of entropy to use, so
    make sure that the file contains line
    <pre>SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG=32</pre>

rationale: |-
    SSH implementation in {{{ full_name }}} uses the openssl library, which doesn't use
    high-entropy sources by default. Randomness is needed to generate data-encryption keys, and as
    plaintext padding and initialization vectors in encryption algorithms, and high-quality
    entropy elliminates the possibility that the output of the random number generator used by SSH
    would be known to potential attackers.

ocil: |-
    To determine whether the SSH service is configured to use strong entropy seed,
    run <pre>$ sudo grep SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG /etc/sysconfig/sshd</pre>
    If a line indicating that SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG is set to 32 is returned,
    then the option is set correctly.

ocil_clause: |-
    the SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG is not set to 32 in /etc/sysconfig/sshd

fixtext: |-
    Configure the {{{ full_name }}} SSH server to use strong entropy.

    Add or modify the following line in the "/etc/sysconfig/sshd" file.

    SSH_USE_STRONG_RNG=32

    The SSH service must be restarted for changes to take effect.

srg_requirement: 'The {{{ full_name }}} must ensure the SSH server uses strong entropy.'

warnings:
    - general: "This setting can cause problems on computers without the hardware random generator, because insufficient entropy causes the connection to be blocked until enough entropy is available."
