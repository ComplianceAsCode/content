title: 'SSHD Must Include System Crypto Policy Config File'

description: |-
    SSHD should follow the system cryptographic policy.
    In order to accomplish this the SSHD configuration should include the configuration file provided by the system crypto policy.
    The following line should be present in <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt> or in a file included by this file (a file within the <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d</tt> directory):
    <pre>Include /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/opensshserver.config</pre>


rationale: |-
    Without cryptographic integrity protections, information can be altered by unauthorized users without detection.

    Verify that RHEL 9 implements DOD-approved encryption ciphers for SSH connections.
    Verify that the SSH configuration files include the path to the systemwide policy with the following command:
    <pre>sudo grep -R Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config  /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/
    
    /etc/ssh/sshd_config:Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf
    /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/50-redhat.conf:Include /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/opensshserver.config</pre>
    If "Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf" or "Include /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/opensshserver.config" are not included in the system sshd config or if the file "/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/50-redhat.conf" is missing, this is a finding.

    Configure the RHEL 9 SSH daemon to use systemwide crypto policies.
    Reinstall OpenSSH server package contents with the following command:
    <pre>sudo dnf -y remove openssh-server && sudo dnf -y install openssh-server</pre>
