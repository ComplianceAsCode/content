title: 'Use Only Strong Key Exchange algorithms'

description: |-
    Limit the Key Exchange to strong algorithms.
    The following line in <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt> demonstrates use
    of those:
    <pre>KexAlgorithms {{{ xccdf_value("sshd_strong_kex") }}}</pre>

rationale: |-
    Key exchange is any method in cryptography by which cryptographic keys are exchanged
    between two parties, allowing use of a cryptographic algorithm. If the sender and receiver
    wish to exchange encrypted messages, each must be equipped to encrypt messages to be
    sent and decrypt messages received

ocil_clause: 'KexAlgorithms option is commented out or not using strong hash algorithms'

ocil: |-
    Only strong KEX algorithms should be used. To verify that only strong
    KexAlgorithms are in use, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep -i kexalgorithms /etc/ssh/sshd_config</pre>
    The output should contain only those KexAlgorithms which are strong, namely,
    {{{ xccdf_value("sshd_strong_kex") }}}
