title: 'Set SSH Daemon LogLevel to VERBOSE'

description: |-
    The <tt>VERBOSE</tt> parameter configures the SSH daemon to record login and logout activity.
    To specify the log level in
    SSH, add or correct the following line in the <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt> file:
    <pre>LogLevel VERBOSE</pre>

rationale: |-
    SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity. <tt>DEBUG</tt> is specifically
    not recommended other than strictly for debugging SSH communications since it provides
    so much data that it is difficult to identify important security information. <tt>INFO</tt> or 
    <tt>VERBOSE</tt> level is the basic level that only records login activity of SSH users. In many
    situations, such as Incident Response, it is important to determine when a particular user was active
    on a system. The logout record can eliminate those users who disconnected, which helps narrow the
    field.

    To check if LogLevel is enabled or set correctly, run the
    following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep "^LogLevel" /etc/ssh/sshd_config</pre>
    If configured properly, output should be <pre>LogLevel VERBOSE</pre>
