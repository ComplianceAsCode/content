    {{{ full_name }}} must log SSH connection attempts and failures to the server.

vuldiscussion: |-
    SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity. "DEBUG" is specifically
    not recommended other than strictly for debugging SSH communications since it provides
    so much data that it is difficult to identify important security information. "INFO" or
    "VERBOSE" level is the basic level that only records login activity of SSH users. In many
    situations, such as Incident Response, it is important to determine when a particular user was active
    on a system. The logout record can eliminate those users who disconnected, which helps narrow the
    field.

    Verify {{{ full_name }}} logs SSH connection attempts and failures to the server.

    Check what the SSH daemon's "LogLevel" option is set to with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -i LogLevel /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    LogLevel VERBOSE

    If a value of "VERBOSE" is not returned, the line is commented out, or is missing, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to log connection attempts add or modify the following line in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config".

    LogLevel VERBOSE

    Restart the SSH daemon for the settings to take effect:

    $ sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
