    The {{{ full_name }}} SSH daemon must not allow known hosts authentication.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Configuring the IgnoreUserKnownHosts setting for the SSH daemon provides additional
    assurance that remote login via SSH will require a password, even
    in the event of misconfiguration elsewhere.

checktext: |-
    Verify the SSH daemon does not allow known hosts authentication with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -ir ignoreuser  /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*

    IgnoreUserKnownHosts yes

    If the value is returned as "no", the returned line is commented out, or no output is returned, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the SSH daemon to not allow known hosts authentication.

    Add the following line in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config", or uncomment the line and set the value to "yes":

    IgnoreUserKnownHosts yes
