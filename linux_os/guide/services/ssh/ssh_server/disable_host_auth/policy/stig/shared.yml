srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must not allow a noncertificate trusted host SSH logon to the system.

vuldiscussion: |-
    SSH trust relationships mean a compromise on one host can allow an attacker to move trivially to other hosts.

checktext: |-
    Verify the operating system does not allow a noncertificate trusted host SSH logon to the system with the following command:

    $ sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -dd 2&gt;&1 | awk '/filename/ {print $4}' | tr -d '\r' | tr '\n' ' ' | xargs sudo grep -iH '^\s*hostbasedauthentication'

    HostbasedAuthentication no

    If the "HostbasedAuthentication" keyword is not set to "no", is missing, or is commented out, this is a finding.

    If the required value is not set, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    To configure {{{ full_name }}} to not allow a noncertificate trusted host SSH logon to the system, add or modify the following line in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" or in a file in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d".

    HostbasedAuthentication no

    Restart the SSH daemon for the settings to take effect:

    $ sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
