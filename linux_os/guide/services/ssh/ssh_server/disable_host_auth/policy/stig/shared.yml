    {{{ full_name }}} must not allow a noncertificate trusted host SSH logon to the system.

    SSH trust relationships mean a compromise on one host
    can allow an attacker to move trivially to other hosts.

    Verify the operating system does not allow a noncertificate trusted host SSH logon to the system with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -ir hostbasedauthentication /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*

    HostbasedAuthentication no

    If the "HostbasedAuthentication" keyword is not set to "no", is missing, or is commented out, this is a finding.

    If the required value is not set, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    To configure {{{ full_name }}} to not allow a noncertificate trusted host SSH logon to the system add or modify the following line in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config".

    HostbasedAuthentication no

    Restart the SSH daemon for the settings to take effect:

    $ sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
