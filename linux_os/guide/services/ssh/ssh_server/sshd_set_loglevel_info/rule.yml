title: 'Set LogLevel to INFO'

description: |-
    The INFO parameter specifices that record login and logout activity will be logged.
    To specify the log level in
    SSH, add or correct the following line in the <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt> file:
    <pre>LogLevel INFO</pre>

rationale: |-
    SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity. <tt>DEBUG</tt> is specifically
    not recommended other than strictly for debugging SSH communications since it provides
    so much data that it is difficult to identify important security information. <tt>INFO</tt> level is the
    basic level that only records login activity of SSH users. In many situations, such as Incident
    Response, it is important to determine when a particular user was active on a system. The
    logout record can eliminate those users who disconnected, which helps narrow the field.
