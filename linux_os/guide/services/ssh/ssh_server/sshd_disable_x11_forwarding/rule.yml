title: 'Disable X11 Forwarding'

description: |-
    The X11Forwarding parameter provides the ability to tunnel X11 traffic
    through the connection to enable remote graphic connections.
    SSH has the capability to encrypt remote X11 connections when SSH's
    <tt>X11Forwarding</tt> option is enabled.
    <br /><br />
    To disable X11 Forwarding, add or correct the
    following line in <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt>:
    <pre>X11Forwarding no</pre>

rationale: |-
    Disable X11 forwarding unless there is an operational requirement to use X11
    applications directly. There is a small risk that the remote X11 servers of
    users who are logged in via SSH with X11 forwarding could be compromised by
    other users on the X11 server. Note that even if X11 forwarding is disabled,
    users can always install their own forwarders.
