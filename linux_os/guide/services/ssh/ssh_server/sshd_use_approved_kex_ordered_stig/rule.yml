title: 'Use Only FIPS 140-2 Validated Key Exchange Algorithms'

description: |-
    Limit the key exchange algorithms to those  which are FIPS-approved.
    Add or modify the following line in <tt>{{{ path }}}</tt>
    <pre>{{{ conf }}}</pre>
    This rule ensures that only the key exchange algorithms mentioned
    above (or their subset) are configured for use, keeping the given
    order of algorithms.

rationale: |-
    DoD information systems are required to use FIPS-approved key exchange algorithms.
    The system will attempt to use the first algorithm presented by the client that matches
    the server list. Listing the values "strongest to weakest" is a method to ensure the use
    of the strongest algorithm available to secure the SSH connection.

ocil_clause: 'KexAlgorithms option is commented out, contains non-approved algorithms, or the FIPS-approved algorithms are not in the exact order'

ocil: |-
    Only FIPS-approved key exchange algorithms must be used. To verify that only FIPS-approved
    key exchange algorithms are in use, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep -i kexalgorithms {{{ path }}}</pre>
    The output should contain only following algorithms (or a subset) in the exact order:
    <pre>{{{ conf }}}</pre>

warnings:
    - general: |-
        The system needs to be rebooted for these changes to take effect.

        This rule doesn't come with a remediation, automatically changing the crypto-policies may be too disruptive.
    {{% endif %}}
    - regulatory: |-
        System crypto modules must be provided by a vendor that undergoes
        FIPS-140 certifications.
        FIPS-140 is applicable to all Federal agencies that use
        cryptographic-based security systems to protect sensitive information
        in computer and telecommunication systems (including voice systems) as
        defined in Section 5131 of the Information Technology Management Reform
        Act of 1996, Public Law 104-106. This standard shall be used in
        designing and implementing cryptographic modules that Federal
        departments and agencies operate or are operated for them under
        contract. See <b>{{{ weblink(link="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf") }}}</b>
        To meet this requirements, the system has to have cryptographic software
        provided by a vendor that has undergone this certification. This means
        providing documentation, test results, design information, and independent
        third party review by an accredited lab. While open source software is
        capable of meeting this, it does not meet FIPS-140 unless the vendor
        submits to this process.
