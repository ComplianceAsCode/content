    {{{ full_name }}} Must Implement Dod-Approved Encryption To Protect The Confidentiality Of Remote Access Sessions.

vuldiscussion: |-
    By decreasing the limit based on the amount of data and enabling
    time-based limit, effects of potential attacks against
    encryption keys are limited.

    To check if RekeyLimit is set correctly, run the
    following command:

     $ sudo grep RekeyLimit /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*

    If configured properly, output should be
     RekeyLimit 1G 1h

    If it is commented out or is not set, then this is a finding.

    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to force a frequent session key renegotiation for SSH connections to the server by adding or modifying the following line in the "/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/00-complianceascode-hardening.conf" file:


    RekeyLimit 1G 1h

    Restart the SSH daemon for the settings to take effect.

    $ sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
