title: 'Disable SSH root Login with a Password (Insecure)'

description: |-
    To disable password-based root logins over SSH, add or correct the following
    line in <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt>:
    <pre>PermitRootLogin prohibit-password</pre>

warnings:
    - general: |-
         While this disables password-based root logins, direct root logins
         through other means such as through SSH keys or GSSAPI will still be
         permitted. Permitting any sort of root login remotely opens up the
         root account to attack.
         To fully disable direct root logins over SSH (which is considered a
         best practice) and prevent remote attacks against the root account,
         see CCE-27100-7, CCE-27445-6, CCE-80901-2, and similar.


rationale: |-
    Even though the communications channel may be encrypted, an additional
    layer of security is gained by preventing use of a password.
    This also helps to minimize direct attack attempts on root's password.
