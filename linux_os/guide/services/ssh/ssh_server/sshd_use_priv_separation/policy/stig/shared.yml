    {{{ full_name }}} SSH daemon must be configured to use privilege separation.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the SSH daemon to perform privilege separation.

    Add the following line in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config", or uncomment the line and set the value to "yes" or "sandbox":

    UsePrivilegeSeparation sandbox

    The SSH service must be restarted for changes to take effect:

    $ sudo systemctl restart sshd.service

checktext: |-
    Verify the SSH daemon performs privilege separation with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -ir usepriv  /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*

    UsePrivilegeSeparation sandbox

    If the "UsePrivilegeSeparation" keyword is set to "no", the returned line is commented out, or no output is returned, this is a finding.

vuln_discussion: |-
    SSH daemon privilege separation causes the SSH process to drop root privileges when not needed, which would decrease the impact of software vulnerabilities in the nonprivileged section.
