    The {{{ full_name }}} SSH daemon must not allow rhosts authentication.

vuldiscussion: |-
    SSH trust relationships mean a compromise on one host
    can allow an attacker to move trivially to other hosts.

checktext: |-
    Verify the SSH daemon does not allow rhosts authentication with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -ir ignorerhosts /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*

    IgnoreRhosts yes

    If the value is returned as "no", the returned line is commented out, or no output is returned, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the SSH daemon to not allow rhosts authentication.

    Add the following line in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config", or uncomment the line and set the value to "yes":

    IgnoreRhosts yes

    The SSH service must be restarted for changes to take effect:

    $ sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
