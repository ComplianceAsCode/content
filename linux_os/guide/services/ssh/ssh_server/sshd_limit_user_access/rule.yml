title: 'Limit Users'' SSH Access'

description: |-
    By default, the SSH configuration allows any user with an account
    to access the system. There are several options available to limit
    which users and group can access the system via SSH. It is
    recommended that at least one of the following options be leveraged:
    - AllowUsers variable gives the system administrator the option of
      allowing specific users to ssh into the system. The list consists of
      space separated user names. Numeric user IDs are not recognized with
      this variable. If a system administrator wants to restrict user
      access further by specifically allowing a user's access only from a
      particular host, the entry can be specified in the form of user@host.
    - AllowGroups variable gives the system administrator the option of
      allowing specific groups of users to ssh into the system. The list
      consists of space separated group names. Numeric group IDs are not
      recognized with this variable.
    - DenyUsers variable gives the system administrator the option of
      denying specific users to ssh into the system. The list consists of
      space separated user names. Numeric user IDs are not recognized with
      this variable. If a system administrator wants to restrict user
      access further by specifically denying a user's access from a
      particular host, the entry can be specified in the form of user@host.
    - DenyGroups variable gives the system administrator the option of
      denying specific groups of users to ssh into the system. The list
      consists of space separated group names. Numeric group IDs are not
      recognized with this variable.

rationale: |-
    Specifying which accounts are allowed SSH access into the system reduces the
    possibility of unauthorized access to the system.

ocil_clause: 'sshd does not limit the users who can log in'

ocil: |-
    To ensure sshd limits the users who can log in, run the following:
    pre>$ sudo grep -rPi '^\h*(allow|deny)(users|groups)\h+\H+(\h+.*)?$' /etc/ssh/sshd_config*</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should be a list of usernames and/or
    groups allowed to log in to this system.

        Automated remediation is not available for this configuration check
        because each system has unique user names and group names.
