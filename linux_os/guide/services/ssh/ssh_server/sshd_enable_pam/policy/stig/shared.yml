srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must enable the Pluggable Authenitcation Module (PAM) interface for SSHD.

vuldiscussion: |-
    When UsePAM is set to yes, PAM runs through account and session types properly. This is
    important if you want to restrict access to services based off of IP, time or other factors of
    the account. Additionally, you can make sure users inherit certain environment variables
    on login or disallow access to the server.

checktext: |-
    Verify the {{{ full_name }}} SSHD is configured to allow for the UsePAM interface with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -i usepam /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    UsePAM yes

    If the "UsePAM" keyword is set to "no", is missing, or is commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the {{{ full_name }}} SSHD to use the UsePAM interface add or modify the following line in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config".

    UsePAM yes

    Restart the SSH daemon for the settings to take effect:

    $ sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
