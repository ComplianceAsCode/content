title: 'Enable the OpenSSH Service'

description: |-
    The SSH server service, sshd, is commonly needed.
    {{{ describe_service_enable(service="sshd") }}}

rationale: |-
    Without protection of the transmitted information, confidentiality, and
    integrity may be compromised because unprotected communications can be
    intercepted and either read or altered.
    <br /><br />
    This checklist item applies to both internal and external networks and all types
    of information system components from which information can be transmitted (e.g., servers,
    mobile devices, notebook computers, printers, copiers, scanners, etc). Communication paths
    outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility
    of interception and modification.
