description: |-
    The SSH server service, sshd, is commonly needed.
    However, if it can be disabled, do so.
    {{% if product in ['debian8', 'ubuntu1404', 'ubuntu1604', 'ubuntu1804'] %}}
    {{{ describe_service_disable(service="sshd") }}}
    {{% else %}}
    {{{ describe_service_disable(service="sshd") }}}
    {{% endif %}}
    This is unusual, as SSH is a common method for encrypted and authenticated
    remote access.
