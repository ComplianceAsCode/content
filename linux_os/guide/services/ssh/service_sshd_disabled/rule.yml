title: 'Disable SSH Server If Possible'

description: |-
    {{% if product == "rhcos4" %}}
    Instead of using ssh to remotely log in to a cluster node, it is recommended
    to use <tt>oc debug</tt>
    {{{ describe_service_disable(service="sshd") }}}
    {{% else %}}
    The SSH server service, sshd, is commonly needed.
    However, if it can be disabled, do so.
    This is unusual, as SSH is a common method for encrypted and authenticated
    remote access.

rationale: |-
    {{% if product == "rhcos4" %}}
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) is a single-purpose container
    operating system. RHCOS is only supported as a component of the
    OpenShift Container Platform. Remote management of the RHCOS nodes is
    performed at the OpenShift Container Platform API level. As a result,
    any direct remote access to the RHCOS nodes is unnecessary. Disabling
    the SSHD service helps reduce the number of open ports on each host.
