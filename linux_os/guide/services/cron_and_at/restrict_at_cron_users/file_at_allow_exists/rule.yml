title: Ensure that /etc/at.allow exists

description: |-
    The file <tt>/etc/at.allow</tt> should exist and should be used instead
    of <tt>/etc/at.deny</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Using the at.allow file to control who can run at jobs enforces this who can schedule jobs.
    It is easier to manage an allow list than a deny list. 

severity: medium

ocil_clause: 'the file /etc/at.allow does not exist'

ocil: |-
    The file <tt>/etc/at.allow</tt> should exist.
    This can be checked by running the following command:
    <pre>
    stat /etc/at.allow
    </pre>
    and the output should list the file.

template:
    name: file_existence
    vars:
        filepath: /etc/at.allow
        exists: true
        fileuid: "0"
        filemode: "0640"
