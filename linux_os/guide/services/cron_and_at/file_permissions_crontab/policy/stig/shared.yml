    The {{{ full_name }}} file must have mode 0600 /etc/crontab.

    Service configuration files enable or disable features of their respective services that if configured incorrectly
    can lead to insecure and vulnerable configurations. Therefore, service configuration files should have the
    correct access rights to prevent unauthorized changes.

    To check the permissions of  /etc/crontab ,
    run the command:
     $ stat -c "%a %n" /etc/crontab
    If properly configured, the output should indicate the following permissions:
    644

    If /etc/crontab does not have unix mode 644 then this is a finding.
