    {{{ full_name }}} cron configuration file directory must be group-owned by root.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Service configuration files enable or disable features of their respective services that if configured incorrectly
    can lead to insecure and vulnerable configurations. Therefore, service configuration files should be owned by the
    correct group to prevent unauthorized changes.

    Verify the group ownership of the "/etc/cron.d" directory with the following command:

    $ ls -lLd /etc/cron.d

    drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 4096 July 11 11:34 /etc/cron.d

    If the "/etc/cron.d" directory does not have a group owner of "root", then this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure "/etc/cron.d" to be group-owned by root with the following command:

    $ sudo chgrp root /etc/cron.d
