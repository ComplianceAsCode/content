    Service configuration files enable or disable features of their respective services that if configured incorrectly
    can lead to insecure and vulnerable configurations. Therefore, service configuration files should be owned by the
    correct group to prevent unauthorized changes.

    To check the group ownership of  /etc/cron.monthly ,
    run the command:
     $ ls -lL /etc/cron.monthly
    If properly configured, the output should indicate the following group-owner:
     root

    If /etc/cron.monthly does not have a group owner of root, then this is a finding.
