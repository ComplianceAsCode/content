    {{{ full_name }}} cron configuration directories must have a mode of 0700 or less permissive

vuldiscussion: |-
    Service configuration files enable or disable features of their respective services that if configured incorrectly
    can lead to insecure and vulnerable configurations. Therefore, service configuration files should have the
    correct access rights to prevent unauthorized changes.

    To check the permissions of the cron directories,
    run the command:
     $ find /etc/cron* -type d | xargs stat -c "%a %n"
    If properly configured, the output should indicate the following permissions:

    700 /etc/cron.d
    700 /etc/cron.daily
    700 /etc/cron.hourly
    700 /etc/cron.monthly
    700 /etc/cron.weekly


    If any cron configuration directory is more permissive than 700, then this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure any {{{ full_name }}} cron configration directory with a mode more permissive than 0700 as follows:

    chmod 0700 [cron configuration directory]
