    {{{ full_name }}} cron configuration files directory must be group-owned by root.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Service configuration files enable or disable features of their respective services that if configured incorrectly
    can lead to insecure and vulnerable configurations. Therefore, service configuration files should be owned by the
    correct group to prevent unauthorized changes.

checktext: |-
    To check the group ownership of all cron configuration files,
    run the command:
     $ sudo stat -c "%G %n" /etc/cron*
    If properly configured, the output should indicate the following group-owner for all files:
    root /etc/cron.d
    root /etc/cron.daily
    root /etc/cron.deny
    root /etc/cron.hourly
    root /etc/cron.monthly
    root /etc/crontab
    root /etc/cron.weekly


    If any crontab is not group owned by group, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure any cron configuration not group-owned by root with the following command:

    $ sudo chgrp root [cron config file]
