title: 'Disable Zone Transfers from the Nameserver'

description: |-
    Is it necessary for a secondary nameserver to receive zone data
    via zone transfer from the primary server?  If not, follow the instructions in
    this section. If so, see the next section for instructions on protecting zone
    transfers.
    Add or correct the following directive within <tt>/etc/named.conf</tt>:
    <pre>options {
      allow-transfer { none; };
      ...
    }</pre>

rationale: |-
    If both the primary and secondary nameserver are under your control,
    or if you have only one nameserver, it may be possible to use an external
    configuration management mechanism to distribute zone updates. In that case, it
    is not necessary to allow zone transfers within BIND itself, so they should be
    disabled to avoid the potential for abuse.
