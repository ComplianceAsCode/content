title: 'Disable Dynamic Updates'

description: |-
    Is there a mission-critical reason to enable the risky dynamic
    update functionality? If not, edit <tt>/etc/named.conf</tt>. For each zone
    specification, correct the following directive if necessary:
    <pre>zone "example.com " IN {
      allow-update { none; };
      ...
    };</pre>

rationale: |-
    Dynamic updates allow remote servers to add, delete, or modify any
    entries in your zone file. Therefore, they should be considered highly risky,
    and disabled unless there is a very good reason for their use. If dynamic
    updates must be allowed, IP-based ACLs are insufficient protection, since they
    are easily spoofed. Instead, use TSIG keys (see the previous section for an
    example), and consider using the update-policy directive to restrict changes to
    only the precise type of change needed.
