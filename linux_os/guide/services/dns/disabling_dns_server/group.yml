title: 'Disable DNS Server'

description: |-
    DNS software should be disabled on any systems which does not
    need to be a nameserver. Note that the BIND DNS server software is
    not installed on {{{ full_name }}} by default. The remainder of this section
    discusses secure configuration of systems which must be
    nameservers.
