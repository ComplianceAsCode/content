    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} does not have a Domain Name Server (DNS) server package installed with the following command:

    $ dnf list --installed unbound

    package unbound is not installed

    If the "unbound" package is installed and the information system security officer (ISSO) lacks a documented requirement for a DNS server, this is a finding.

    If system is not a Domain Name Server (DNS) server it shouldn't have a DNS server package installed to decrease the attack surface of the system.
