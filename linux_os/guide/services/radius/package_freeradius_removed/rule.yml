title: 'Remove the FreeRadius Server Package'

description: |-
    The <tt>freeradius</tt> package should be removed if not in use.
    Is this system a RADIUS server? If not, remove the package.
    {{{ describe_package_remove(package="freeradius") }}}
    The freeradius RPM is not installed by default on a {{{ full_name }}}
    system. It is needed only by the RADIUS servers, not by the
    clients which use RADIUS for authentication. If the system is not
    intended for use as a RADIUS Server it should be removed.

rationale: |-
    Unnecessary packages should not be installed to decrease the attack
    surface of the system.  While this software is clearly essential on a
    RADIUS server, it is not necessary on typical desktop or workstation systems.
