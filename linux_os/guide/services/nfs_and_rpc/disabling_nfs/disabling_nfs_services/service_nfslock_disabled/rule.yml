title: 'Disable Network File System Lock Service (nfslock)'

description: |-
    The Network File System Lock (nfslock) service starts the required
    remote procedure call (RPC) processes which allow clients to lock files on the
    server. If the local system is not configured to mount NFS filesystems then
    this service should be disabled.
