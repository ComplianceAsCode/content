title: 'Uninstall rpcbind Package'

description: |-
    The rpcbind utility maps RPC services to the ports on which they listen.
    RPC processes notify rpcbind when they start, registering the ports they
    are listening on and the RPC program numbers they expect to serve. The
    rpcbind service redirects the client to the proper port number so it can
    communicate with the requested service. If the system does not require RPC
    (such as for NFS servers) then this service should be disabled.
    {{{ describe_package_remove(package="rpcbind") }}}

rationale: |-
    If the system does not require rpc based services, it is recommended that
    rpcbind be disabled to reduce the attack surface.
