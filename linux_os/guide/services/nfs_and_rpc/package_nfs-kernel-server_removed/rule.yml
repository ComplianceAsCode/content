    <tt>nfs-kernel-server</tt> provides a daemon for the kernel NFS server and related tools. This
    package also contains the <tt>showmount</tt> program. <tt>showmount</tt> queries the mount
    daemon on a remote host for information about the Network File System (NFS) server on the
    remote host. For example, <tt>showmount</tt> can display the clients which are mounted on
    that host.
