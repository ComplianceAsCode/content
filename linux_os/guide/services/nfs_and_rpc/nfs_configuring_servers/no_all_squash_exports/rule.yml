title: 'Ensure All-Squashing Disabled On All Exports'

description: |-
    The <tt>all_squash</tt> maps all uids and gids to an anonymous user.
    This should be disabled by removing any instances of the
    <tt>all_squash</tt> option from the file <tt>/etc/exports</tt>.

rationale: |-
    The all_squash option maps all client requests to a single anonymous
    uid/gid on the NFS server, negating the ability to track file access
    by user ID.
