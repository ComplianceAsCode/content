    {{{ full_name }}} must be configured so that the Network File System (NFS) is configured to use RPCSEC_GSS.

vuldiscussion: |-
    When an NFS server is configured to use AUTH_SYS a selected userid and groupid are used to handle
    requests from the remote user. The userid and groupid could mistakenly or maliciously be set
    incorrectly. The AUTH_GSS method of authentication uses certificates on the server and client
    systems to more securely authenticate the remote mount request.

checktext: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} has the "sec" option is configured for all NFS exports with the following command:

    Note: If the system does not have any filesystems mounted for NFS export this requirement is Not Applicable.

    $ grep "sec=" /etc/exports

    192.168.17.7:/mnt/export /data1 nfs4 rw,sync ,soft,sec=krb5p:krb5i:krb5

    If the system is exporting file systems via NFS and has the sec option without the "krbp:krb5i:krb5" settings, the "sec" option has the "sys" setting, or the "sec" option is missing, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Update the "/etc/fstab" file so the option "sec" is defined for each NFS mounted file system and the "sec" option does not have the "sys" setting.

    Ensure the "sec" option is defined as "krb5p:krb5i:krb5".
