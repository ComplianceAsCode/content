title: 'Use Kerberos Security on All Exports'

description: |-
    Using Kerberos on all exported mounts prevents a malicious client or user from
    impersonating a system user. To cryptography authenticate users to the NFS server,
    add <tt>sec=krb5:krb5i:krb5p</tt> to each export in <tt>/etc/exports</tt>.

rationale: |-
    When an NFS server is configured to use AUTH_SYS a selected userid and groupid are used to handle
    requests from the remote user. The userid and groupid could mistakenly or maliciously be set
    incorrectly. The AUTH_GSS method of authentication uses certificates on the server and client
    systems to more securely authenticate the remote mount request.

ocil_clause: 'the setting is not configured, has the ''sys'' option added, or does not have all Kerberos options added'

ocil: |-
    To verify the <tt>sec</tt> option is configured for all NFS mounts, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep "sec=" /etc/exports</pre>
    All configured NFS exports should show the <tt>sec=krb5:krb5i:krb5p</tt> setting in parentheses.
    This is not applicable if NFS is not implemented.
