title: 'Ensure Insecure File Locking is Not Allowed'

description: "By default the NFS server requires secure file-lock requests,\nwhich require credentials from the client in order to lock a file. Most NFS\nclients send credentials with file lock requests, however, there are a few\nclients that do not send credentials when requesting a file-lock, allowing the\nclient to only be able to lock world-readable files. To get around this, the\n<tt>insecure_locks</tt> option can be used so these clients can access the\ndesired export. This poses a security risk by potentially allowing the client\naccess to data for which it does not have authorization.\nRemove any instances of the \n<tt>insecure_locks</tt> option from the file <tt>/etc/exports</tt>."

rationale: |-
    Allowing insecure file locking could allow for sensitive data to be
    viewed or edited by an unauthorized user.
