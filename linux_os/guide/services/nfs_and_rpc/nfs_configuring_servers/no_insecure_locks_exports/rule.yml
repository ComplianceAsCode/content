title: 'Ensure Insecure File Locking is Not Allowed'

description: |-
    By default the NFS server requires secure file-lock requests, which require
    credentials from the client in order to lock a file. Most NFS clients send
    credentials with file lock requests, however, there are a few clients that
    do not send credentials when requesting a file-lock, allowing the client to
    only be able to lock world-readable files. To get around this, the
    <tt>insecure_locks</tt> option can be used so these clients can access the
    desired export. This poses a security risk by potentially allowing the
    client access to data for which it does not have authorization. Remove any
    instances of the <tt>insecure_locks</tt> option from the file
    <tt>/etc/exports</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Allowing insecure file locking could allow for sensitive data to be
    viewed or edited by an unauthorized user.
