title: 'NFS and RPC'

description: |-
    The Network File System is a popular distributed filesystem for
    the Unix environment, and is very widely deployed.  This section discusses the
    circumstances under which it is possible to disable NFS and its dependencies,
    and then details steps which should be taken to secure
    NFS's configuration. This section is relevant to systems operating as NFS
    clients, as well as to those operating as NFS servers.
