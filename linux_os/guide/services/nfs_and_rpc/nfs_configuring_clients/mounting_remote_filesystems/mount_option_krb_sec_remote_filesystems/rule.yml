title: 'Mount Remote Filesystems with Kerberos Security'

description: '{{{ describe_mount(option="sec=krb5:krb5i:krb5p", part="any NFS mounts") }}}'

rationale: |-
    When an NFS server is configured to use AUTH_SYS a selected userid and groupid are used to handle
    requests from the remote user. The userid and groupid could mistakenly or maliciously be set
    incorrectly. The AUTH_GSS method of authentication uses certificates on the server and client
    systems to more securely authenticate the remote mount request.

ocil_clause: 'the setting is not configured, has the ''sys'' option added, or does not have all Kerberos options added'

ocil: |-
    To verify the <tt>sec</tt> option is configured for all NFS mounts, run the following command:
    <pre>$ mount | grep "sec="</pre>
    All NFS mounts should show the <tt>sec=krb5:krb5i:krb5p</tt> setting in parentheses.
    This is not applicable if NFS is not implemented.
