title: 'Disable Network File System (nfs)'

description: |-
    The Network File System (NFS) service allows remote hosts to mount
    and interact with shared filesystems on the local system. If the local system
    is not designated as a NFS server then this service should be disabled.
    {{{ describe_service_disable(service="nfs") }}}

rationale: 'Unnecessary services should be disabled to decrease the attack surface of the system.'
