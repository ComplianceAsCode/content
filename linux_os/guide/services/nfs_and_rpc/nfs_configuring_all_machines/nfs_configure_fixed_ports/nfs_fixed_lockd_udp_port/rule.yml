title: 'Configure lockd to use static UDP port'

description: |-
    Configure the <tt>lockd</tt> daemon to use a static UDP port as
    opposed to letting the RPC Bind service dynamically assign a port. Edit the
    file <tt>/etc/sysconfig/nfs</tt>. Add or correct the following line:
    <pre>LOCKD_UDPPORT=lockd-port</pre>
    Where <tt>lockd-port</tt> is a port which is not used by any other service on
    your network.

rationale: |-
    Restricting services to always use a given port enables firewalling
    to be done more effectively.
