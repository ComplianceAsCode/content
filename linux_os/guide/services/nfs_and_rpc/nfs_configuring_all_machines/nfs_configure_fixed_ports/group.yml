title: 'Configure NFS Services to Use Fixed Ports (NFSv3 and NFSv2)'

description: |-
    Firewalling should be done at each host and at the border
    firewalls to protect the NFS daemons from remote access, since NFS servers
    should never be accessible from outside the organization. However, by default
    for NFSv3 and NFSv2, the RPC Bind service assigns each NFS service to a port
    dynamically at service startup time. Dynamic ports cannot be protected by port
    {{% if product == "rhel7" %}}
    filtering firewalls such as <tt>firewalld</tt>.
    {{% else %}}
    filtering firewalls such as <tt>iptables</tt>.
    {{% endif %}}
    <br /><br />
    Therefore, restrict each service to always use a given port, so that
    firewalling can be done effectively. Note that, because of the way RPC is
    implemented, it is not possible to disable the RPC Bind service even if ports
    are assigned statically to all RPC services.
    <br /><br />
    In NFSv4, the mounting and locking protocols have been incorporated into the
    protocol, and the server listens on the the well-known TCP port 2049. As such,
    NFSv4 does not need to interact with the <tt>rpcbind, lockd, and rpc.statd</tt>
    daemons, which can and should be disabled in a pure NFSv4 environment. The
    <tt>rpc.mountd</tt> daemon is still required on the NFS server to setup
    exports, but is not involved in any over-the-wire operations.
