title: 'Make Each System a Client or a Server, not Both'

description: |-
    If NFS must be used, it should be deployed in the simplest
    configuration possible to avoid maintainability problems which may lead to
    unnecessary security exposure. Due to the reliability and security problems
    caused by NFS (specially NFSv3 and NFSv2), it is not a good idea for systems
    which act as NFS servers to also mount filesystems via NFS. At the least,
    crossed mounts (the situation in which each of two servers mounts a filesystem
    from the other) should never be used.
