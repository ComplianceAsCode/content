    "nfs-utils" provides a daemon for the kernel NFS server and related tools. This
    package also contains the "showmount" program. "showmount" queries the mount
    daemon on a remote host for information about the Network File System (NFS) server on the
    remote host. For example, "showmount" can display the clients which are mounted on
    that host.
