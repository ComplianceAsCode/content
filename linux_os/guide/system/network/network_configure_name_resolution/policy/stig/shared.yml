srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} systems using Domain Name Servers (DNS) resolution must have at least two name servers configured.

vuldiscussion: |-
    To provide availability for name resolution services, multiple redundant
    name servers are mandated. A failure in name resolution could lead to the
    failure of security functions requiring name resolution, which may include
    time synchronization, centralized authentication, and remote system logging.

checktext: |-
    Verify the name servers used by the system with the following command:

    $ grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf

    nameserver 192.168.1.2
    nameserver 192.168.1.3

    If less than two lines are returned that are not commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the operating system to use two or more name servers for DNS resolution.

    By default, "NetworkManager" on {{{ full_name }}} dynamically updates the /etc/resolv.conf file with the DNS settings from active "NetworkManager" connection profiles. However, this feature can be disabled to allow manual configurations.

    If manually configuring DNS, edit the "/etc/resolv.conf" file to uncomment or add the two or more "nameserver" option lines with the IP address of local authoritative name servers.
