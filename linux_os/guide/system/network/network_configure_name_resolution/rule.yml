title: 'Configure Multiple DNS Servers in /etc/resolv.conf'

description: |-
    {{% if "ol" in product or "rhel" in product %}}
    Determine whether the system is using local or DNS name resolution with the
    following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep hosts /etc/nsswitch.conf
    hosts: files dns</pre>
    If the DNS entry is missing from the host's line in the "/etc/nsswitch.conf"
    file, the "/etc/resolv.conf" file must be empty.
    Verify the "/etc/resolv.conf" file is empty with the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo ls -al /etc/resolv.conf
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Aug 19 08:31 resolv.conf</pre>
    If the DNS entry is found on the host's line of the "/etc/nsswitch.conf" file,
    then verify the following:<br/>
    {{% endif %}}
    Multiple Domain Name System (DNS) Servers should be configured
    in <tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt>. This provides redundant name resolution services
    in the event that a domain server crashes. To configure the system to contain
    as least <tt>2</tt> DNS servers, add a corresponding <tt>nameserver
    <i>ip_address</i></tt> entry in <tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt> for each DNS
    server where <i>ip_address</i> is the IP address of a valid DNS server.
    For example:
    <pre>search example.com
    nameserver 192.168.0.1
    nameserver 192.168.0.2</pre>

rationale: |-
    To provide availability for name resolution services, multiple redundant
    name servers are mandated. A failure in name resolution could lead to the
    failure of security functions requiring name resolution, which may include
    time synchronization, centralized authentication, and remote system logging.

ocil: |-
    Verify that DNS servers have been configured properly, perform the following:
    <pre>$ sudo grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf</pre>

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to use two or more name servers for DNS resolution.

    By default, "NetworkManager" on {{{ full_name }}} dynamically updates the /etc/resolv.conf file with the DNS settings from active "NetworkManager" connection profiles. However, this feature can be disabled to allow manual configurations.

    If manually configuring DNS, edit the "/etc/resolv.conf" file to uncomment or add the two or more "nameserver" option lines with the IP address of local authoritative name servers. If local host resolution is being performed, the "/etc/resolv.conf" file must be empty. An empty "/etc/resolv.conf" file can be created as follows:

    $ sudo echo -n > /etc/resolv.conf

srg_requirement: 'For {{{ full_name }}} systems using Domain Name Servers (DNS) resolution, at least two name servers must be configured.'

warnings:
  - general: This rule doesn't come with a remediation, the IP addresses of local authoritative name servers need to be added by the administrator.
