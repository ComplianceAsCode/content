title: 'Configure Multiple DNS Servers in /etc/resolv.conf'

description: |-
    Multiple Domain Name System (DNS) Servers should be configured
    in <tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt>. This provides redundant name resolution services
    in the event that a domain server crashes. To configure the system to contain
    as least <tt>2</tt> DNS servers, add a corresponding <tt>nameserver
    <i>ip_address</i></tt> entry in <tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt> for each DNS
    server where <i>ip_address</i> is the IP address of a valid DNS server.
    For example:
    <pre>search example.com
    nameserver 192.168.0.1
    nameserver 192.168.0.2</pre>

rationale: |-
    To provide availability for name resolution services, multiple redundant
    name servers are mandated. A failure in name resolution could lead to the
    failure of security functions requiring name resolution, which may include
    time synchronization, centralized authentication, and remote system logging.

ocil_clause: 'it does not exist or is not properly configured or less than 2 ''nameserver'' entries exist'

ocil: |-
    To verify that DNS servers have been configured properly, perform the following:
    <pre>$ sudo grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf</pre>
    The output should return more than one <pre>nameserver</pre> entry.
