title: 'Configure Multiple DNS Servers in /etc/resolv.conf'

description: |-
    {{% if "ol" in product or "rhel" in product %}}
    Determine whether the system is using local or DNS name resolution with the
    following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep hosts /etc/nsswitch.conf
    hosts: files dns</pre>
    If the DNS entry is missing from the host's line in the "/etc/nsswitch.conf"
    file, the "/etc/resolv.conf" file must be empty.
    Verify the "/etc/resolv.conf" file is empty with the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo ls -al /etc/resolv.conf
    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Aug 19 08:31 resolv.conf</pre>
    If the DNS entry is found on the host's line of the "/etc/nsswitch.conf" file,
    then verify the following:<br/>
    {{% endif %}}
    Multiple Domain Name System (DNS) Servers should be configured
    in <tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt>. This provides redundant name resolution services
    in the event that a domain server crashes. To configure the system to contain
    as least <tt>2</tt> DNS servers, add a corresponding <tt>nameserver
    <i>ip_address</i></tt> entry in <tt>/etc/resolv.conf</tt> for each DNS
    server where <i>ip_address</i> is the IP address of a valid DNS server.
    For example:
    <pre>search example.com
    nameserver 192.168.0.1
    nameserver 192.168.0.2</pre>

rationale: |-
    To provide availability for name resolution services, multiple redundant
    name servers are mandated. A failure in name resolution could lead to the
    failure of security functions requiring name resolution, which may include
    time synchronization, centralized authentication, and remote system logging.

    Verify that DNS servers have been configured properly, perform the following:
    <pre>$ sudo grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf</pre>

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to use two or more name servers for DNS resolution.

    By default, "NetworkManager" on {{{ full_name }}} dynamically updates the /etc/resolv.conf file with the DNS settings from active "NetworkManager" connection profiles. However, this feature can be disabled to allow manual configurations.

    If manually configuring DNS, edit the "/etc/resolv.conf" file to uncomment or add the two or more "nameserver" option lines with the IP address of local authoritative name servers. If local host resolution is being performed, the "/etc/resolv.conf" file must be empty. An empty "/etc/resolv.conf" file can be created as follows:

    $ sudo echo -n > /etc/resolv.conf

srg_requirement: 'For {{{ full_name }}} systems using Domain Name Servers (DNS) resolution, at least two name servers must be configured.'
