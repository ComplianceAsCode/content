title: 'Disable WiFi or Bluetooth in BIOS'

description: |-
    Some machines that include built-in wireless support offer the
    ability to disable the device through the BIOS. This is hardware-specific;
    consult your hardware manual or explore the BIOS setup during
    boot.

rationale: |-
    Disabling wireless support in the BIOS prevents easy
    activation of the wireless interface, generally requiring administrators
    to reboot the system first.
