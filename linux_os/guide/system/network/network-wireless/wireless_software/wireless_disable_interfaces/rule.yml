title: 'Deactivate Wireless Network Interfaces'

description: |-
    Deactivating wireless network interfaces should prevent
    normal usage of the wireless capability.
    <br /><br />
    Configure the system to disable all wireless network interfaces with the
    following command:
    <pre>$ sudo nmcli radio wifi off</pre>

rationale: |-
    The use of wireless networking can introduce many different attack vectors into
    the organization's network. Common attack vectors such as malicious association
    and ad hoc networks will allow an attacker to spoof a wireless access point
    (AP), allowing validated systems to connect to the malicious AP and enabling the
    attacker to monitor and record network traffic. These malicious APs can also
    serve to create a man-in-the-middle attack or be used to create a denial of
    service to valid network resources.
