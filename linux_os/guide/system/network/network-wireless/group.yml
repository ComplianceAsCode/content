title: 'Wireless Networking'

description: "Wireless networking, such as 802.11\n(WiFi) and Bluetooth, can present a security risk to sensitive or\nclassified systems and networks. Wireless networking hardware is\nmuch more likely to be included in laptop or portable systems than\nin desktops or servers. \n<br /><br />\nRemoval of hardware provides the greatest assurance that the wireless\ncapability remains disabled. Acquisition policies often include provisions to\nprevent the purchase of equipment that will be used in sensitive spaces and\nincludes wireless capabilities. If it is impractical to remove the wireless\nhardware, and policy permits the device to enter sensitive spaces as long\nas wireless is disabled, efforts should instead focus on disabling wireless capability\nvia software."
