title: 'Grant Or Deny System Access To Specific Hosts And Services'

description: |-
    To verify the system's access control program is configured
    to grant or deny system access to specific hosts check to see
    if "firewalld" is active with the following command:

    <pre># systemctl status firewalld
    firewalld.service - firewalld - dynamic firewall daemon
    Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/firewalld.service; enabled)
    Active: active (running) since Sun 2014-04-20 14:06:46 BST; 30s ago</pre>

    If "firewalld" is active, check to see if it is configured to grant or deny
    access to specific hosts or services with the following commands:

    <pre># firewall-cmd --get-default-zone
    public

    # firewall-cmd --list-all --zone=public
    public (active)
    target: default
    icmp-block-inversion: no
    interfaces: eth0
    sources:
    services: mdns ssh
    ports:
    protocols:
    masquerade: no
    forward-ports:
    icmp-blocks:</pre>

    If "firewalld" is not active, determine whether "tcpwrappers" is being used by checking
    whether the "hosts.allow" and "hosts.deny" files are empty with the following commands:

    <pre># ls -al /etc/hosts.allow
    rw-r----- 1 root root 9 Aug 2 23:13 /etc/hosts.allow

    # ls -al /etc/hosts.deny
    -rw-r----- 1 root root 9 Apr 9 2007 /etc/hosts.deny</pre>

    If "firewalld" and "tcpwrappers" are not installed, configured, and active,
    ask the SA if another access control program (such as iptables) is installed
    and active.

    Ask the SA to show that the running configuration grants or denies access
    to specific hosts or services.

    If "firewalld" is active and is not configured to grant access to specific
    hosts or "tcpwrappers" is not configured to grant or deny access to
    specific hosts, this is a finding.

rationale: |-
    If the systems access control program is not configured with appropriate
    rules for allowing and denying access to system network resources,
    services may be accessible to unauthorized hosts.

ocil_clause: 'the system access control program is not configured'

ocil: |-
    To verify there is a system access control program configured
    to grant or deny system access to specific hosts check to see
    if "firewalld" is active and the default zone is "public".

    If "firewalld" is not active, determine whether "tcpwrappers"
    is being used by checking whether the "hosts.allow" and "hosts.deny"
    files are empty.

    If "firewalld" is not active and configured, and the "hosts.allow" and
    "hosts.deny" files are empty, this is a finding.

warnings:
    - general: |-
        This rule checks that either firewalld or tcpwrappers are being used
        to restrict system access to some hosts and/or services. It does not
        check for any specific hosts/services. Make sure that the allowed
        hosts/services meet your operational needs.
