title: 'Uncommon Network Protocols'

description: |-
    The system includes support for several network protocols which are not commonly used.
    Although security vulnerabilities in kernel networking code are not frequently discovered,
    the consequences can be dramatic. Ensuring uncommon network protocols are disabled
    reduces the system's risk to attacks targeted at its implementation of those protocols.

warnings:
    - general: |-
        Although these protocols are not commonly used, avoid disruption
        in your network environment by ensuring they are not needed
        prior to disabling them.
