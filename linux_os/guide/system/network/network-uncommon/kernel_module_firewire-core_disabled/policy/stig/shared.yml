    {{{ full_name }}} must be configured to disable the FireWire kernel module.

fixtext: |-
    To configure the system to prevent the firewire-core kernel module from being loaded, add the following lines to the file /etc/modprobe.d/firewire-core.conf (or create firewire-core.conf if it does not exist):

    install firewire-core /bin/false
    blacklist firewire-core

    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} disables the ability to load the firewire-core kernel module with the following command:

    $ grep -r firewire-core /etc/modprobe.conf /etc/modprobe.d/*

    install firewire-core /bin/false
    blacklist firewire-core

    If the command does not return any output, or the lines are commented out, and use of firewire-core is not documented with the information system security officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, this is a finding.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Disabling firewire protects the system against exploitation of any flaws in its implementation.
