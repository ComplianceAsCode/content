    {{{ full_name }}} must be configured to disable the Controller Area Network kernel module.

    Disabling Controller Area Network (CAN) protects the system against exploitation of any flaws in its implementation.

checktext: |-
    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} disables the ability to load the CAN kernel module with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -r can /etc/modprobe.conf /etc/modprobe.d/*

    blacklist can

fixtext: |-
    To configure the system to prevent the can kernel module from being loaded, add the following line to the file  /etc/modprobe.d/can.conf (or create atm.conf if it does not exist):

    blacklist can
