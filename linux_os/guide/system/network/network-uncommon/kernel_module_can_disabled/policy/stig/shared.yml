    Disabling Controller Area Network (CAN) protects the system against exploitation of any
    flaws in its implementation.

    If the system is configured to prevent the loading of the  can  kernel module,
    it will contain lines inside any file in  /etc/modprobe.d  or the deprecated /etc/modprobe.conf .
    These lines instruct the module loading system to run another program (such as  /bin/true ) upon a module  install  event.
    Run the following command to search for such lines in all files in  /etc/modprobe.d  and the deprecated  /etc/modprobe.conf :
     $ grep -r can /etc/modprobe.conf /etc/modprobe.d

    If no line is returned, then this is a finding.
