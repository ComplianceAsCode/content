title: Verify User Who Owns /etc/ipsec.conf File

description: '{{{ describe_file_owner(file="/etc/ipsec.conf", owner="root") }}}'

rationale: |-
    The ownership of the /etc/ipsec.conf file by the root user is important
    because this file hosts Libreswan configuration. Protection of this
    file is critical for system security. Assigning the ownership to root
    ensures exclusive control of the Libreswan configuration.
