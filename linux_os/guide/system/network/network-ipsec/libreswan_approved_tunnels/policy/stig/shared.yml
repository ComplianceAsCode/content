    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} does not have unauthorized IP tunnels configured.

    Check to see if the "IPSec" service is active with the following command"

    $ systemctl status ipsec

    ipsec.service - Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Protocol Daemon for IPsec
    Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/ipsec.service; disabled)
    Active: inactive (dead)

    If the "IPsec" service is active, check for configured IPsec connections ("conn"), with the following command:

    $ grep -rni conn /etc/ipsec.conf /etc/ipsec.d/

    Verify any returned results are documented with the ISSO.

    If the IPSec tunnels are active and not approved, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Remove all unapproved tunnels from the system, or document them with the ISSO.
