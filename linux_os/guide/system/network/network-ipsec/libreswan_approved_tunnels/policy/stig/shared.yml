    {{{ full_name }}} must not have unauthorized IP tunnels configured.

vuldiscussion: |-
    IP tunneling mechanisms can be used to bypass network filtering. If tunneling is required, it must be documented with the information system security officer (ISSO).

checktext: |-
    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} does not have unauthorized IP tunnels configured.

    Determine if the "IPsec" service is active with the following command:

    {{% if product in ['sle15', 'sle16'] %}}
    $ systemctl is-active ipsec
    {{% else %}}
    $ systemctl is-active strongswan
    {{% endif %}}

    Inactive

    If the "IPsec" service is active, check for configured IPsec connections ("conn"), with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -rni conn /etc/ipsec.conf /etc/ipsec.d/
    {{% if product in ['sle15', 'sle16'] %}}
    Also:
    $ sudo grep -rni conn /etc/swanctl/swanctl.conf /etc/swanctl/conf.d/
    {{% endif %}}
    Verify any returned results are documented with the ISSO.

    If the IPsec tunnels are active and not approved, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Remove all unapproved tunnels from the system, or document them with the ISSO.
