title: Verify User Who Owns /etc/ipsec.d Directory

description: '{{{ describe_file_owner(file="/etc/ipsec.d", owner="root") }}}'

rationale: |-
    The ownership of the /etc/ipsec.d directory by the root user is important
    because this directory hosts Libreswan configuration. Protection of this
    file is critical for system security. Assigning the ownership to root
    ensures exclusive control of the Libreswan configuration.
