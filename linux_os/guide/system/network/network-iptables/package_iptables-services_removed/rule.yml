title: 'Remove iptables-services Package'

description: |-
    {{{ describe_package_remove(package="iptables-services") }}}

rationale: |-
    <tt>iptables-services</tt> provides the services iptables and ip6tables that have been split
    out of the base package since they are not active by default anymore. These services load the
    iptables rules during the system startup and also allow one to reload the iptables rules
    during runtime. Those iptables services conflicts with firewalld so they should be removed if
    firewalld is used.
