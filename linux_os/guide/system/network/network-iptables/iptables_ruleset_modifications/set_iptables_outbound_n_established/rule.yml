title: 'Ensure Outbound and Established Connections are Configured'

description: |-
    Configure the firewall rules for new outbound and established connections.

rationale: |-
    If rules are not in place for new outbound, and established connections all packets will
    be dropped by the default policy preventing network usage.

ocil_clause: 'there are no rules configuring outbound or established connections'

ocil: |-
    Inspect the output of commands:
    <pre>$ iptables -L -v -n</pre>
    , or for IPv6
    <pre>$ ip6tables -L -v -n</pre>
    , to inspect that rules for new outbound, and established connections match site policy

fixtext: |-
    Configure iptables in accordance with site policy. The following commands will implement
    a policy to allow all outbound connections and all established connections:
    <pre>
    # iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
    # iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
    # iptables -A OUTPUT -p icmp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
    # iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
    # iptables -A INPUT -p udp -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
    # iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
    </pre>
    ,use ip6tables in case of IPv6 is enabled and IPv6 rules need to be configured

warnings:
    - general: |-
        Changing firewall settings while connected over network can result in being
        locked out of the system.
