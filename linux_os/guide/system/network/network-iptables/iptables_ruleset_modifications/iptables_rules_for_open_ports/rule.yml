title: 'Ensure iptables Firewall Rules Exist for All Open Ports'

description: |-
    Any ports that have been opened on non-loopback addresses
    need firewall rules to govern traffic.

rationale: |-
    Without a firewall rule configured for open ports default
    firewall policy will drop all packets to these ports.

severity: medium

platform: not package[nftables] and not package[ufw]

ocil: |-
    Run the following command to determine open ports:
    <pre># ss -4tuln</pre>
    Run the following command to determine firewall rules:
    <pre># iptables -L INPUT -v -n</pre>
    For each port identified in the audit which does not have a firewall
    rule, add rule for accepting or denying inbound connections
    <pre># iptables -A INPUT -p <protocol> --dport <port> -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT</pre>

warnings:
    - general: |-
        Changing firewall settings while connected over network can
        result in being locked out of the system.
