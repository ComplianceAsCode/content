title: 'Ensure iptables are flushed'

description: |-
    nftables is a replacement for iptables, ip6tables, ebtables and arptables

rationale: |-
    It is possible to mix iptables and nftables. However, this increases complexity 
    and also the chance to introduce errors. For simplicity flush out all iptables 
    rules, and ensure it is not loaded.
