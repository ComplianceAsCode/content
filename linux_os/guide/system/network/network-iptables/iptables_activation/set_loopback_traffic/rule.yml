title: 'Set configuration for loopback traffic' 

description: |-
    Configure the loopback interface to accept traffic. 
    Configure all other interfaces to deny traffic to the loopback 
    network.

rationale: |-
    Loopback traffic is generated between processes on machine and is 
    typically critical to operation of the system. The loopback interface 
    is the only place that loopback network traffic should be seen, all 
    other interfaces should ignore traffic on this network as an
    anti-spoofing measure.

        Changing firewall settings while connected over network can 
        result in being locked out of the system.

ocil: |-
    Verify that the loopback interface is configured:
    <pre>
    # nft list ruleset | awk '/hook input/,/}/' | grep 'ip saddr'
    </pre>
    If IPv6 is enabled, verify that the IPv6 loopback interface is configured:
    <pre>
    # nft list ruleset | awk '/hook input/,/}/' | grep 'ip6 saddr'
    </pre>
