title: 'Set configuration for loopback traffic'

description: |-
    Configure the loopback interface to accept traffic.
    Configure all other interfaces to deny traffic to the loopback
    network.

rationale: |-
    Loopback traffic is generated between processes on machine and is
    typically critical to operation of the system. The loopback interface
    is the only place that loopback network traffic should be seen, all
    other interfaces should ignore traffic on this network as an
    anti-spoofing measure.
