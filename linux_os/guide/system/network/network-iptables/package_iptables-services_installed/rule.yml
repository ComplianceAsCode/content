title: 'Install iptables-services Package'

description: |-
    {{{ describe_package_install(package="iptables-services") }}}

rationale: |-
    <tt>iptables-services</tt> provides the services iptables and ip6tables that have been split
    out of the base package since they are not active by default anymore.
    These services load the iptables rules during the system startup and also allow one to reload
    the iptables rules during runtime.
