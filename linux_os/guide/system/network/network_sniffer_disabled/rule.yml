title: 'Ensure System is Not Acting as a Network Sniffer'

description: |-
    The system should not be acting as a network sniffer, which can
    capture all traffic on the network to which it is connected. Run the following
    to determine if any interface is running in promiscuous mode:
    <pre>$ ip link | grep PROMISC</pre>

rationale: |-
    Network interfaces in promiscuous mode allow for the capture of all network traffic
    visible to the system. If unauthorized individuals can access these applications, it
    may allow them to collect information such as logon IDs, passwords, and key exchanges
    between systems.
    <br /><br />
    If the system is being used to perform a network troubleshooting function, the use of these
    tools must be documented with the Information Systems Security Manager (ISSM) and restricted
    to only authorized personnel.
