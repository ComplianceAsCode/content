    Check the firewall configuration for any unnecessary or prohibited
    functions, ports, protocols, and/or services by running the following
    command:

    <pre># grep ^FW_ /etc/sysconfig/SuSEfirewall2
    FW_SERVICES_ACCEPT_EXT="0/0,tcp,22,,hitcount=3,blockseconds=60,recentname=ssh"</pre>

    Ask the System Administrator for the site or program PPSM Component Local
    Services Assessment (Component Local Services Assessment (CLSA). Verify the
    services allowed by the firewall match the PPSM CLSA. 

rationale: |-
    To prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of
    information, or unauthorized tunneling (i.e., embedding of data types
    within data types), organizations must disable or restrict unused or
    unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols on information systems.

    SUSE operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions
    and services. Some of the functions and services provided by default may not
    be necessary to support essential organizational operations. Additionally,
    it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single
    component (e.g., VPN and IPS); however, doing so increases risk over
    limiting the services provided by any one component.

    To support the requirements and principles of least functionality, the SUSE
    operating system must support the organizational requirements, providing
    only essential capabilities and limiting the use of ports, protocols,
    and/or services to only those required, authorized, and approved to conduct
    official business or address authorized quality-of-life issues.

    Check the firewall configuration for any unnecessary or prohibited 
    functions, ports, protocols, and/or services by running the following 
    command:

    <pre># grep ^FW_ /etc/sysconfig/SuSEfirewall2
    FW_SERVICES_ACCEPT_EXT="0/0,tcp,22,,hitcount=3,blockseconds=60,recentname=ssh"</pre>

    Ask the System Administrator for the site or program PPSM Component Local 
    Services Assessment (Component Local Services Assessment (CLSA). Verify the     services allowed by the firewall match the PPSM CLSA.

    If there are any additional ports, protocols, or services that are not 
    included in the PPSM CLSA, this is a finding.

    If there are any ports, protocols, or services that are prohibited by the 
    PPSM CAL, this is a finding.
