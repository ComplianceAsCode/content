title: 'Enable the SuSEfirewall 2'

description: |-
    {{{ describe_service_enable(service="SuSEfirewall2") }}}

rationale: |-
    To prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of
    information, or unauthorized tunneling (i.e., embedding of data types
    within data types), organizations must disable or restrict unused or
    unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols on information systems.

    SUSE operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions
    and services. Some of the functions and services provided by default may
    not be necessary to support essential organizational operations.
    Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from
    a single component (e.g., VPN and IPS); however, doing so increases risk
    over limiting the services provided by any one component.
