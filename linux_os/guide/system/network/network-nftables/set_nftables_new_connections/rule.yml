title: 'Ensure all outbound and established connections are configured for nftables'

description: |-
   Configure the nftables firewall rules for new outbound and established connections

rationale: |-
    If rules are not in place for new outbound and established connections, all packets 
    will be dropped by the default policy preventing network usage.

ocil_clause: 'All nftables rules for established incoming, and for new and outbound connections do not match site policy'

ocil: |-
    To verify that all nftables rules on your system for established incoming connections match site policy,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo  nft list ruleset | awk '/hook input/,/}/' | grep -E 'ip protocol (tcp|udp|icmp) ct state'</pre>
    Output should be similar to:
    <tt>
      ip protocol tcp ct state established accept
      ip protocol udp ct state established accept
      ip protocol icmp ct state established accept
    </tt>
    To verify that all nftables rules for new and established outbound connections match site policy,
    run:
    <pre>$ sudo nft list ruleset | awk '/hook output/,/}/' | grep -E 'ip protocol (tcp|udp|icmp) ct state'</pre>
    and output should be similar to:
    <tt>
      ip protocol tcp ct state established,related,new accept
      ip protocol udp ct state established,related,new accept
      ip protocol icmp ct state established,related,new accept
    </tt>
    To configure nftables in accordance with site policy which will allow all outbound and all 
    established connections, run the following commands:
    <pre>$ sudo nft add rule inet filter input ip protocol tcp ct state established accept</pre>
    <pre>$ sudo nft add rule inet filter input ip protocol udp ct state established accept</pre>
    <pre>$ sudo nft add rule inet filter input ip protocol icmp ct state established accept</pre>
    <pre>$ sudo nft add rule inet filter output ip protocol tcp ct state new,related,established accept</pre>
    <pre>$ sudo nft add rule inet filter output ip protocol udp ct state new,related,established accept</pre>
    <pre>$ sudo nft add rule inet filter output ip protocol icmp ct state new,related,established accept</pre>
