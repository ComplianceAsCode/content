title: 'Ensure a Table Exists for Nftables'

description: |-
   Tables in nftables hold chains. Each table only has one address family and only applies
   to packets of this family. Tables can have one of six families.

rationale: |-
    Nftables doesn't have any default tables. Without a table being built, nftables will not filter
    network traffic.
    Note: adding rules to a running nftables can cause loss of connectivity to the system.
