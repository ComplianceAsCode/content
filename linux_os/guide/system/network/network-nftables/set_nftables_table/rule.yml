title: 'Ensure a Table Exists for Nftables'

description: |-
   Tables in nftables hold chains. Each table only has one address family and only applies 
   to packets of this family. Tables can have one of six families.

rationale: |-
    Nftables doesn't have any default tables. Without a table being built, nftables will not filter
    network traffic.
    Note: adding rules to a running nftables can cause loss of connectivity to the system.

ocil: |-
    To verify that a nftables table exists, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo nft list tables</pre>
    Output should include a list of nftables similar to:
    <tt>
      table inet filter
    </tt>
