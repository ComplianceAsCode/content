title: 'Ensure a Table Exists for Nftables'

description: |-
    Tables in nftables hold chains. Each table only has one address family and only applies
    to packets of this family. Tables can have one of six families.
    {{% if "rhel" in product %}}
    {{{ full_name }}} uses <tt>firewalld</tt> for firewall management. When <tt>nftables</tt> is
    the firewall backend used by <tt>firewalld</tt>, an <tt>{{{ xccdf_value("var_nftables_family") }}}</tt>
    family table called <tt>{{{ xccdf_value("var_nftables_table") }}}</tt> is used.

    To verify that the <tt>nftables</tt> table used by <tt>firewalld</tt> exists, run the following
    command:
    <pre>$ sudo nft list tables
    table {{{ xccdf_value("var_nftables_family") }}} {{{ xccdf_value("var_nftables_table") }}}
    </pre>
    This table is automatically created by <tt>firewalld</tt> when it is started.
    {{%- endif %}}

rationale: |-
    Nftables doesn't have any default tables. Without a table being built, nftables will not
    filter network traffic.

ocil_clause: 'a nftables table does not exist'

warnings:
    - general: |-
        Adding or editing rules in a running nftables can cause loss of connectivity to the system.
    - general: |-
        Both the SCE check and remediation for this rule only consider runtime settings.
        There is no specific file to check as it depends on each site's policy. Therefore, check
        and remediation use the nft command directly. The fix is not persistent across system
        reboots.
    - functionality: |-
        SCE check does not support variables, therefore the SCE check in this rule only checks the
        address family, regardless of the table name.

ocil: |-
    To verify that a nftables table exists, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo nft list tables</pre>
    Output should include a list of nftables similar to:
    <tt>
      table {{{ xccdf_value("var_nftables_family") }}} {{{ xccdf_value("var_nftables_table") }}}
    </tt>
