title: 'Set nftables Configuration for Loopback Traffic'

description: |-
    Configure the loopback interface to accept traffic.
    Configure all other interfaces to deny traffic to the loopback
    network.

rationale: |-
    Loopback traffic is generated between processes on machine and is
    typically critical to operation of the system. The loopback interface
    is the only place that loopback network traffic should be seen,
    all other interfaces should ignore traffic on this network as an
    anti-spoofing measure.

severity: medium

platform: package[nftables] and service_disabled[firewalld]

warnings:
    - general: |-
        Changing firewall settings while connected over network can
        result in being locked out of the system.
        Keep in mind the remediation makes changes only to the running
        system, in order to keep the changes need to take care to save
        the nft settings to the relvant configutation files.

ocil: |-
    Verify that the loopback interface is configured:
    <pre>
    # nft list ruleset | awk '/hook input/,/}/' | grep 'iif "lo" accept'
    </pre>
    iif "lo" accept
    If IPv6 is enabled, verify that the IPv6 loopback interface is configured:
    <pre>
    # nft list ruleset | awk '/hook input/,/}/' | grep 'ip6 saddr'
    </pre>
    ip saddr 127.0.0.0/8 counter packets 0 bytes 0 drop
