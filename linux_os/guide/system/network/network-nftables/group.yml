title: 'nftables'

description: |-
    <tt>If firewalld or iptables are being used in your environment, please follow the guidance in their
    respective section and pass-over the guidance in this section.</tt>
    <br /><br />
    nftables is a subsystem of the Linux kernel providing filtering and classification of network
    packets/datagrams/frames and is the successor to iptables. The biggest change with the
    successor nftables is its simplicity. With iptables, we have to configure every single rule and
    use the syntax which can be compared with normal commands. With nftables, the simpler
    syntax, much like BPF (Berkely Packet Filter) means shorter lines and less repetition.
    Support for nftables should also be compiled into the kernel, together with the related
    nftables modules.
    <br /><br /> 
    It is available in Linux kernels >= 3.13. <b>Please ensure that your kernel
    supports nftables before choosing this option.</b>
