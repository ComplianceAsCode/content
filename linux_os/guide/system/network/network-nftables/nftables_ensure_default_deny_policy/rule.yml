title: 'Ensure nftables Default Deny Firewall Policy'

description: |-
   Base chain policy is the default verdict that will be applied to packets reaching the end of
   the chain. There are two policies: accept (Default) and drop. If the policy is set to accept,
   the firewall will accept any packet that is not configured to be denied and the packet will
   continue traversing the network stack.

rationale: |
   It is easier to allow acceptable usage than to block unacceptable usage.

warnings:
   - general: |-
       Changing firewall settings while connected over network can result in being locked out
       of the system.

ocil: |-
    Run the following commands and verify that base chains policy is <tt>drop</tt>:
    <pre>$ sudo nft list ruleset | grep 'hook input' </pre>
    Output should include a list of nftables similar to:
    <tt>type filter hook input priority 0; policy drop; </tt>
    Same goes not only for <tt>hook input</tt>, but also <tt>output</tt> and <tt>forward</tt>
