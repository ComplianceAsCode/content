title: 'Disable Support for IPv6 Unless Needed'

description: |-
    Despite configuration that suggests support for IPv6 has
    been disabled, link-local IPv6 address auto-configuration occurs
    even when only an IPv4 address is assigned. The only way to
    effectively prevent execution of the IPv6 networking stack is to
    instruct the system not to activate the IPv6 kernel module.
