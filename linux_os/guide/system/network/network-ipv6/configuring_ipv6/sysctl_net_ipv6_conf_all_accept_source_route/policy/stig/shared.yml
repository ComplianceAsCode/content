srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must not forward IPv6 source-routed packets.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Source-routed packets allow the source of the packet to suggest that routers forward the packet along a different path than configured on the router, which can be used to bypass network security measures. This requirement applies only to the forwarding of source-routed traffic, such as when forwarding is enabled and the system is functioning as a router.


checktext: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} does not accept IPv6 source-routed packets.

    Note: If IPv6 is disabled on the system, this requirement is Not Applicable.

    Check the value of the accept source route variable with the following command:

    $ sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route

    net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0

    If the returned line does not have a value of "0", a line is not returned, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.

    Check that the configuration files are present to enable this network parameter.

    $ sudo /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysctl --cat-config | egrep -v '^(#|;)' |  grep -F net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route | tail -1

    net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0

    If "net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route" is not set to "0" or is missing, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to not forward IPv6 source-routed packets.

    Add or edit the following line in a single system configuration file, in the "/etc/sysctl.d/" directory:

    net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0

    Load settings from all system configuration files with the following command:

    $ sudo sysctl --system
