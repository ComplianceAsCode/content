title: 'Configure IPv6 Settings if Necessary'

description: |-
    A major feature of IPv6 is the extent to which systems
    implementing it can automatically configure their networking
    devices using information from the network. From a security
    perspective, manually configuring important configuration
    information is preferable to accepting it from the network
    in an unauthenticated fashion.
