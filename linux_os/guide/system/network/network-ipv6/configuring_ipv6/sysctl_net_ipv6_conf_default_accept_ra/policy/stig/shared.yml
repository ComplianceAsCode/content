srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must not accept router advertisements on all IPv6 interfaces by default.

vuldiscussion: |-
    An illicit router advertisement message could result in a man-in-the-middle attack.

checktext: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} does not accept router advertisements on all IPv6 interfaces by default, unless the system is a router.

    Note: If IPv6 is disabled on the system, this requirement is not applicable.

    Check to see if router advertisements are not accepted by default by using the following command:

    $ sudo sysctl net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra

    net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra = 0

    If the "accept_ra" value is not "0" and is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, this is a finding.

    Check that the configuration files are present to enable this network parameter.

    $ { /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysctl --cat-config; cat /etc/sysctl.conf; } | egrep -v '^(#|$)' | grep -F net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra | tail -1

    net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra = 0

    If "net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra" is not set to "0" or is missing, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to not accept router advertisements on all IPv6 interfaces by default unless the system is a router.

    Add or edit the following line in a single system configuration file, in the "/etc/sysctl.d/" directory:

    net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra=0

    Load settings from all system configuration files with the following command:

    $ sudo sysctl --system
