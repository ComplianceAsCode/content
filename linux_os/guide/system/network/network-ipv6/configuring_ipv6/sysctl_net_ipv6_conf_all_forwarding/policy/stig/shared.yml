srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must not enable IPv6 packet forwarding unless the system is a router.

vuldiscussion: |-
    IP forwarding permits the kernel to forward packets from one network
    interface to another. The ability to forward packets between two networks is
    only appropriate for systems acting as routers.

checktext: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} is not performing IPv6 packet forwarding, unless the system is a router.

    Note: If IPv6 is disabled on the system, this requirement is Not Applicable.

    Check that IPv6 forwarding is disabled using the following commands:

    $ sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding

    net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 0

    If the IPv6 forwarding value is not "0" and is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, this is a finding.

    Check that the configuration files are present to enable this network parameter.

    $ sudo /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysctl --cat-config | egrep -v '^(#|;)' | grep -F net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding | tail -1

    net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 0

    If "net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding" is not set to "0" or is missing, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to not allow IPv6 packet forwarding, unless the system is a router.

    Add or edit the following line in a single system configuration file, in the "/etc/sysctl.d/" directory:

    net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding = 0

    Load settings from all system configuration files with the following command:

    $ sudo sysctl --system
