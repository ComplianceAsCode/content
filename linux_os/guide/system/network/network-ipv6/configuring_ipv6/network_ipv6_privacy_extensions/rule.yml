title: 'Use Privacy Extensions for Address'

description: |-
    To introduce randomness into the automatic generation of IPv6
    addresses, add or correct the following line in
    <tt>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<i>interface</i></tt>:
    <pre>IPV6_PRIVACY=rfc3041</pre>
    Automatically-generated IPv6 addresses are based on the underlying hardware
    (e.g. Ethernet) address, and so it becomes possible to track a piece of
    hardware over its lifetime using its traffic. If it is important for a system's
    IP address to not trivially reveal its hardware address, this setting should be
    applied.
