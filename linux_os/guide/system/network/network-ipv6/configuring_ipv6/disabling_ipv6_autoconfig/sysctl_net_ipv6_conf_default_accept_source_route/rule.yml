title: 'Configure Kernel Parameter for Accepting Source-Routed Packets for Interfaces By Default'

description: '{{{ describe_sysctl_option_value(sysctl="net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_source_route", value="0") }}}'

rationale: |-
    Source-routed packets allow the source of the packet to suggest routers
    forward the packet along a different path than configured on the router, which can
    be used to bypass network security measures. This requirement applies only to the
    forwarding of source-routerd traffic, such as when IPv6 forwarding is enabled and
    the system is functioning as a router.

    Accepting source-routed packets in the IPv6 protocol has few legitimate
    uses. It should be disabled unless it is absolutely required.
