title: 'Ensure ufw Default Deny Firewall Policy'

description: |-
    A default deny policy on connections ensures that any unconfigured
    network usage will be rejected.

    Note: Any port or protocol without a explicit allow before the default
    deny will be blocked.

rationale: |-
    With a default accept policy the firewall will accept any packet that
    is not configured to be denied. It is easier to allow acceptable
    usage than to block unacceptable usage.

severity: medium

platform: package[ufw]

ocil_clause: |-
    the default policy for the incoming, outgoing and routed is not set to deny,
    reject or disabled

ocil: |-
    Run the following command and verify that the default policy for incoming,
    outgoing, and routed directions is deny, reject, or disabled:
    <pre># ufw status verbose | grep Default:</pre>
    Example output:
    <pre>Default: deny (incoming), deny (outgoing), disabled (routed)</pre>

warnings:
    - general: |-
        Changing firewall settings while connected over network can
        result in being locked out of the system.
