title: 'Ensure ufw Firewall Rules Exist for All Open Ports'

description: |-
    Any ports that have been opened on non-loopback addresses
    need firewall rules to govern traffic.

rationale: |-
    Without a firewall rule configured for open ports default
    firewall policy will drop all packets to these ports.

severity: medium

platform: package[ufw]

references:
    cis@ubuntu2204: 3.5.1.6

ocil_clause: 'open ports are denied connection'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command to determine open ports:
    <pre># ss -tuln</pre>
    Run the following command to determine firewall rules:
    <pre># ufw status verbose</pre>
    For each port identified in the audit which does not have a firewall
    rule, add rule for accepting or denying inbound connections
    <pre># ufw allow in <port>/<tcp or udp protocol></pre>

warnings:
    - general: |-
        Changing firewall settings while connected over network can
        result in being locked out of the system.
