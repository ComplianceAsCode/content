title: 'Only Allow Authorized Network Services in ufw'

description: |-
    Check the firewall configuration for any unnecessary or prohibited
    functions, ports, protocols, and/or services by running the following
    command:
    <pre>$ sudo ufw show raw
    Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
    target prot opt sources destination
    Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 1 packets, 40 bytes)
    pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination
    Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
    pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination
    Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
    pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination</pre>

    Ask the System Administrator for the site or program PPSM CLSA. Verify
    the services allowed by the firewall match the PPSM CLSA.

rationale: |-
    To prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of
    information, or unauthorized tunneling (i.e., embedding of data types
    within data types), organizations must disable or restrict unused or
    unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols on information systems.

    Operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions
    and services. Some of the functions and services provided by default
    may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations.
    Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services
    from a single component (e.g., VPN and IPS); however, doing so
    increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component.

    To support the requirements and principles of least functionality, the
    operating system must support the organizational requirements, providing
    only essential capabilities and limiting the use of ports, protocols,
    and/or services to only those required, authorized, and approved to
    conduct official business or to address authorized quality of life
    issues.

ocil_clause: 'unauthorized network services can be accessed from the network'

ocil: |-
    Check the firewall configuration for any unnecessary or prohibited
    functions, ports, protocols, and/or services by running the following
    command:
    <pre>$ sudo ufw show raw</pre>

    Ask the System Administrator for the site or program PPSM CLSA. Verify
    the services allowed by the firewall match the PPSM CLSA.

    Add all ports, protocols, or services allowed by the PPSM CLSA by using
    the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo ufw allow "direction" "port/protocol/service"</pre>
    where the direction is "in" or "out" and the port is the one
    corresponding to the protocol or service allowed.

    To deny access to ports, protocols, or services, use:
    <pre>$ sudo ufw deny "direction" "port/protocol/service"</pre>
