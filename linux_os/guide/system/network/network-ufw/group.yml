title: Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw)

description: |-
    The Linux kernel in Ubuntu provides a packet filtering system called
    netfilter, and the traditional interface for manipulating netfilter are
    the iptables suite of commands. iptables provide a complete firewall
    solution that is both highly configurable and highly flexible.

    Becoming proficient in iptables takes time, and getting started with
    netfilter firewalling using only iptables can be a daunting task. As a
    result, many frontends for iptables have been created over the years,
    each trying to achieve a different result and targeting a different
    audience.

    The Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw) is a frontend for iptables and is
    particularly well-suited for host-based firewalls. ufw provides a
    framework for managing netfilter, as well as a command-line interface
    for manipulating the firewall. ufw aims to provide an easy to use
    interface for people unfamiliar with firewall concepts, while at the
    same time simplifies complicated iptables commands to help an
    administrator who knows what he or she is doing. ufw is an upstream
    for other distributions and graphical frontends.
