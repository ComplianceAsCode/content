title: 'Configure Firewalld to Restrict Loopback Traffic'

description: |-
    Configure <tt>firewalld</tt> to restrict loopback traffic to the <tt>lo</tt> interface.

    The loopback traffic must be trusted by assigning the <tt>lo</tt> interface to the
    <tt>firewalld</tt> <tt>trusted</tt> zone. However, the loopback traffic must be restricted
    to the loopback interface as an anti-spoofing measure.

    To configure <tt>firewalld</tt> to restrict loopback traffic to the <tt>lo</tt> interface,
    run the following commands:
    <pre>
    sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=trusted --add-rich-rule='rule family=ipv4 source address="127.0.0.1" destination not address="127.0.0.1" drop'
    sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=trusted --add-rich-rule='rule family=ipv6 source address="::1" destination not address="::1" drop'
    </pre>

    To ensure <tt>firewalld</tt> settings are applied in runtime, run the following command:
    <pre>firewall-cmd --reload</pre>

rationale: |-
    Loopback traffic is generated between processes on machine and is typically critical to
    operation of the system. The loopback interface is the only place that loopback network
    traffic should be seen, all other interfaces should ignore traffic on this network as an
    anti-spoofing measure.

ocil: |-
    Inspect the firewalld trusted and default zones and verify the loopback traffic is restricted
    to the <tt>lo</tt> interface by running the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo firewall-cmd --list-rich-rules --zone=trusted</pre>

    The following rich-rules should be listed:
    <pre>
    rule family="ipv4" source address="127.0.0.1" destination not address="127.0.0.1" drop
    rule family="ipv6" source address="::1" destination not address="127.0.0.1" drop
    </pre>
