title: 'Configure Firewalld to Trust Loopback Traffic'

description: |-
    Assign loopback interface to the <tt>firewalld</tt> <tt>trusted</tt> zone in order to
    explicitly allow the loopback traffic in the system.

    To configure <tt>firewalld</tt> to trust loopback traffic, run the following command:
    <pre>sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=trusted --add-interface=lo</pre>
    To ensure <tt>firewalld</tt> settings are applied in runtime, run the following command:
    <pre>firewall-cmd --reload</pre>

rationale: |-
    Loopback traffic is generated between processes on machine and is typically critical to
    operation of the system. The loopback interface is the only place that loopback network
    traffic should be seen, all other interfaces should ignore traffic on this network as an
    anti-spoofing measure.

ocil_clause: 'loopback traffic is not trusted'

ocil: |-
    Inspect the network interfaces assigned to the firewalld trusted zone and verify the
    <tt>lo</tt> interface is listed by running the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo firewall-cmd --list-interfaces --zone=trusted</pre>

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to explicitly trust loopback traffic using the following commands:
