    A {{{ full_name }}} firewall must employ a deny-all, allow-by-exception policy for allowing connections to other systems.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Failure to restrict network connectivity only to authorized systems permits inbound connections from malicious systems. It also permits outbound connections that may facilitate exfiltration of DoD data.

    {{{ full_name }}} incorporates the "firewalld" daemon, which allows for many different configurations. One of these configurations is zones. Zones can be utilized to a deny-all, allow-by-exception approach. The default "drop" zone will drop all incoming network packets unless it is explicitly allowed by the configuration file or is related to an outgoing network connection.

    Verify the {{{ full_name }}} "firewalld" is configured to employ a deny-all, allow-by-exception policy for allowing connections to other systems with the following commands:

    $ sudo  firewall-cmd --state

    running

    $ sudo firewall-cmd --get-active-zones

    public
       interfaces: ens33

    $ sudo firewall-cmd --info-zone=public | grep target

       target: DROP

    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --info-zone=public | grep target

       target: DROP

    If no zones are active on the {{{ full_name }}} interfaces or if runtime and permanent targets are set to a different option other than "DROP", this is a finding.

    Configure the "firewalld" daemon to employ a deny-all, allow-by-exception with the following commands:

    Start by adding the exceptions that are required for mission functionality to the "drop" zone. If you need SSH access on port 22, for example, run the following: "sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ssh --zone=drop"

    Reload the firewall rules to update the runtime configuration from the "--permanent" changes made above:
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --reload

    Set the default zone to the drop zone:
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=drop
    Note: This is a runtime and permanent change.

    Add any interfaces to the newly modified "drop" zone:
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=drop --change-interface=ens33

    Reload the firewall rules for changes to take effect:
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --reload
