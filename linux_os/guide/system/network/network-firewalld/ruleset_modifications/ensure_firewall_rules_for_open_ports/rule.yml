title: 'Ensure firewall rules exist for all open ports'

description: |-
    Any ports that have been opened on non-loopback addresses need firewall rules to govern
    traffic.

rationale: |-
    Without a firewall rule configured for open ports default firewall policy will drop all
    packets to these ports.

    Inspect the list of open listening ports with the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo ss -tuln</pre>

    tcp          LISTEN        0             100                          [::1]:25                          [::]:*
    tcp          LISTEN        0             128                           [::]:22                          [::]:*
    </pre>
    Verify for the above output that rules exist for tcp port 22 and udp port 68
    <pre>
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
    public
      interfaces: eth0 eth1
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --info-zone public |grep services
      services: ssh
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --info-service ssh|grep ports
      ssh
        ports: 22/tcp
    </pre>
    Which shows that rule for port 68, opened most probably by a dhcp client, is missing.

fixtext: |-
    For each port identified in the audit which does not have a firewall rule establish a proper
    rule for accepting inbound connections:

    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=service_name
    or
    $ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent  --family=inet|inet6 --add-port=port_number/(tcp|udp)

warnings:
    - general: |-
        To prevent denying any access to the system, automatic remediation
        of this control is not available. Remediation must be automated as
        a component of machine provisioning, or followed manually as outlined
        above.
