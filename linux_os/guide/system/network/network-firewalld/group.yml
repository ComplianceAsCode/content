title: firewalld

description: |-
    The dynamic firewall daemon <tt>firewalld</tt> provides a
    dynamically managed firewall with support for network &#8220;zones&#8221; to assign
    a level of trust to a network and its associated connections and interfaces.
    zones are distinguished based on the level of trust the user has decided to place on the devices and
    traffic within that network. <tt>NetworkManager</tt> informs firewalld to which
    zone an interface belongs. An interface's assigned zone can be changed by
    <tt>NetworkManager</tt> or via the <tt>firewall-config</tt> tool.
    It has support for IPv4 and IPv6 firewall settings. It supports Ethernet
    bridges and has a separation of runtime and permanent configuration options.
    It also has an interface for services or applications to add firewall rules
    directly.
    <br />
    A graphical configuration tool, <tt>firewall-config</tt>, is used to configure
    <tt>firewalld</tt>, which in turn uses <tt>iptables</tt> tool to communicate
    with <tt>Netfilter</tt> in the kernel which implements packet filtering.
    <br />
    The firewall service provided by <tt>firewalld</tt> is dynamic rather than
    static because changes to the configuration can be made at anytime and are
    immediately implemented. There is no need to save or apply the changes. No
    unintended disruption of existing network connections occurs as no part of
    the firewall has to be reloaded.

warnings:
    - general: |-
        The program <tt>firewall-config</tt>
        allows additional services to penetrate the default firewall rules
        and automatically adjusts the <tt>firewalld</tt> ruleset(s).
