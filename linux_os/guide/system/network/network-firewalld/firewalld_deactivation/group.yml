title: 'Dectivate firewalld Rules'

description: |-
    Firewalls can be used to separate networks into different zones
    based on the level of trust the user has decided to place on the devices and
    traffic within that network.
    Firewalls can be implemented using variety of software tools and services,
    i.e. iptables, nftables, firewalld, ufw, SuSEFirewall2 etc.
    Having more than one service controlling the firewall functionality may lead
    to conflicts and misconfiguration.
    Therefore, in case one uses iptables or nftables firewalld service should
    be disabled.
