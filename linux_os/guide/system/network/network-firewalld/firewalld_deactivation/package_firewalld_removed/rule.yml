title: 'Uninstall firewalld Package'

description: |-
    firewalld (Dynamic Firewall Manager) provides a dynamically managed firewall with
    support for network/firewall “zones” to assign a level of trust to a network and its
    associated connections, interfaces or sources. It has support for IPv4, IPv6, Ethernet
    bridges and also for IPSet firewall settings. There is a separation of the runtime and
    permanent configuration options.
