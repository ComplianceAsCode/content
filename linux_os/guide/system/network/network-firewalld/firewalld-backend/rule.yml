title: 'Configure Firewalld to Use the Nftables Backend'

description: |-
    Firewalld can be configured with many backends, such as nftables.

rationale: |-
    Nftables is modern kernel module for controling network connections coming into a system.
    Utilizing the limit statement in "nftables" can help to mitigate DoS attacks.

ocil_clause: 'the "nftables" is not set as the "firewallbackend"'

ocil: |-
    Verify "nftables" is configured to allow rate limits on any connection to the system with the following command:

    Verify "firewalld" has "nftables" set as the default backend:

    $ sudo grep -i firewallbackend /etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf

    # FirewallBackend
    FirewallBackend=nftables

fixtext: |-
    Configure "nftables" to be the default "firewallbackend" for "firewalld" by adding or editing the following line in "/etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf":

    FirewallBackend=nftables

    Establish rate-limiting rules based on organization-defined types of DoS attacks on impacted network interfaces.
