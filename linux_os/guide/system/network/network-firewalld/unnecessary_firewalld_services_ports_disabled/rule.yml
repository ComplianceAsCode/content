title: 'Ensure Unnecessary Services and Ports Are Not Accepted'

description: |-
    Services and ports can be accepted or explicitly rejected or dropped by a zone.
    For every zone, a default behavior can be set that handles incoming traffic that 
    is not further specified. Such behavior is defined by setting the target of the zone. 
    The possible options are:
    - <tt>ACCEPT</tt> - accepts all incoming packets except those disabled by a specific rule.
    - <tt>REJECT</tt> - disables all incoming packets except those that have been allowed in
       specific rules and the source machine is informed about the rejection.
    - <tt>DROP</tt> - disables all incoming packets except those that have been allowed in
       specific rules and no information sent to the source machine.

rationale: |-
    To reduce the attack surface of a system, all services and ports should be blocked unless
    required.

ocil: |-
    To review and to ensure that listed services and ports follow site policy run the 
    following command: 
    <pre>$ sudo firewall-cmd --get-active-zones | awk '!/:/ {print $1}' | while read ZN; do
    firewall-cmd --list-all --zone=$ZN; done</pre>
    To remove an unnecessary service, run the following command: 
    <pre>$ sudo firewall-cmd --remove-service=<service></pre>
    To remove an unnecessary port, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo firewall-cmd --remove-port=<port-number>/<port-type></pre>
