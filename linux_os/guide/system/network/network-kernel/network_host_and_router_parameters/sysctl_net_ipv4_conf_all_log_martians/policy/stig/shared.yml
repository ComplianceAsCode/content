    {{{ full_name }}} Must Be Configured In Accordance With The Security Configuration Settings Based On Dod Security Configuration Or Implementation Guidance, Including Stigs, Nsa Configuration Guides, Ctos, And Dtms.

    The presence of "martian" packets (which have impossible addresses)
    as well as spoofed packets, source-routed packets, and redirects could be a
    sign of nefarious network activity. Logging these packets enables this activity
    to be detected.

checktext: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} logs IPv4 martian packets.

    Check the value of the accept source route variable with the following command:

    $ sudo sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians

    net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians = 1

    If the returned line does not have a value of "1", a line is not returned, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.

    Check that the configuration files are present to enable this network parameter.

    $ { /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysctl --cat-config; cat /etc/sysctl.conf; } | egrep -v '^(#|$)' | grep -F net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians | tail -1

    net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians = 1

    If "net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians" is not set to "1" or is missing, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to log martian packets on IPv4 interfaces.

    Add or edit the following line in a single system configuration file, in the "/etc/sysctl.d/" directory:

    net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians=1

    Load settings from all system configuration files with the following command:

    $ sudo sysctl --system
