srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must not respond to Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echoes sent to a broadcast address.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Responding to broadcast (ICMP) echoes facilitates network mapping
    and provides a vector for amplification attacks.


    Ignoring ICMP echo requests (pings) sent to broadcast or multicast
    addresses makes the system slightly more difficult to enumerate on the network.

checktext: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} does not respond to ICMP echoes sent to a broadcast address.

    Check the value of the "icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts" variable with the following command:

    $ sysctl net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts

    net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1

    If the returned line does not have a value of "1", a line is not returned, or the retuned line is commented out, this is a finding.

    Check that the configuration files are present to enable this network parameter.

    $ { /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysctl --cat-config; cat /etc/sysctl.conf; } | egrep -v '^(#|$)' | grep -F net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts | tail -1

    net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1

    If "net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts" is not set to "1" or is missing, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to not respond to IPv4 ICMP echoes sent to a broadcast address.

    Add or edit the following line in a single system configuration file, in the "/etc/sysctl.d/" directory:

    net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1

    Load settings from all system configuration files with the following command:

    $ sudo sysctl --system
