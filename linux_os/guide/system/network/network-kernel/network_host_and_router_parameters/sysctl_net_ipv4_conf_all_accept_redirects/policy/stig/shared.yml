srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must ignore Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) redirect messages.

vuldiscussion: |-
    ICMP redirect messages are used by routers to inform hosts that a more
    direct route exists for a particular destination. These messages modify the
    host's route table and are unauthenticated. An illicit ICMP redirect
    message could result in a man-in-the-middle attack.


    This feature of the IPv4 protocol has few legitimate uses. It should be
    disabled unless absolutely required."

checktext: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} will not accept IPv4 ICMP redirect messages.

    Check the value of the all "accept_redirects" variables with the following command:

    $ sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects

    net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0

    If the returned line does not have a value of "0", a line is not returned, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.

    Check that the configuration files are present to enable this network parameter.

    $ sudo /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysctl --cat-config | egrep -v '^(#|;)' | grep -F net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects | tail -1

    net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0

    If "net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects" is not set to "0" or is missing, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to ignore IPv4 ICMP redirect messages.

    Add or edit the following line in a single system configuration file, in the "/etc/sysctl.d/" directory:

    net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0

    Load settings from all system configuration files with the following command:

    $ sudo sysctl --system
