title: 'Configure Kernel to Rate Limit Sending of Duplicate TCP Acknowledgments'

description: |-
    Make sure that the system is configured to limit the maximal rate for sending
    duplicate acknowledgments in response to incoming TCP packets that are for
    an existing connection but that are invalid due to any of these reasons:

    (a) out-of-window sequence number, (b) out-of-window acknowledgment number,
    or (c) PAWS (Protection Against Wrapped Sequence numbers) check failure
    This measure protects against or limits effects of DoS attacks against the system.
    Set the system to implement rate-limiting measures by adding the following line to
    <tt>/etc/sysctl.conf</tt> or a configuration file in the <tt>/etc/sysctl.d/</tt> directory
    (or modify the line to have the required value):
    <pre>net.ipv4.tcp_invalid_ratelimit = <sub idref="sysctl_net_ipv4_tcp_invalid_ratelimit_value" /></pre>
    Issue the following command to make the changes take effect:
    <pre># sysctl --system</pre>

rationale: |-
    Denial of Service (DoS) is a condition when a resource is not available for legitimate users. When
    this occurs, the organization either cannot accomplish its mission or must
    operate at degraded capacity.
    <br /><br />
    This can help mitigate simple “ack loop” DoS attacks, wherein a buggy or
    malicious middlebox or man-in-the-middle can rewrite TCP header fields in
    manner that causes each endpoint to think that the other is sending invalid
    TCP segments, thus causing each side to send an unterminating stream of
    duplicate acknowledgments for invalid segments.

ocil_clause: 'rate limiting of duplicate TCP acknowledgments is not configured'

ocil: |-
    To verify that the operating system protects against or limits the effects of DoS
    attacks by ensuring implementation of rate-limiting measures
    on impacted network interfaces, run the following command:
    <pre># grep 'net.ipv4.tcp_invalid_ratelimit' /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/*</pre>
    The command should output the following line:
    <pre>/etc/sysctl.conf:net.ipv4.tcp_invalid_ratelimit = <sub idref="sysctl_net_ipv4_tcp_invalid_ratelimit_value" /></pre>
    The file where the line has been found can differ, but it must be either <tt>/etc/sysctl.conf</tt>
    or a file located under the <tt>/etc/sysctl.d/</tt> directory.
