title: 'Disable Kernel Parameter for IPv4 Forwarding on all IPv4 Interfaces'

description: '{{{ describe_sysctl_option_value(sysctl="net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding", value="0") }}}'

rationale: |-
    IP forwarding permits the kernel to forward packets from one network
    interface to another. The ability to forward packets between two networks is
    only appropriate for systems acting as routers.

ocil_clause: 'IP forwarding value is "1" and the system is not router'

ocil: |-
    {{{ ocil_sysctl_option_value(sysctl="net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding", value="0") }}}
    The ability to forward packets is only appropriate for routers.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to not allow packet forwarding unless the system is a router with the following commands:
    {{{ fixtext_sysctl(sysctl="net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding", value="0") | indent(4) }}}

srg_requirement: '{{{ full_name }}} must not perform packet forwarding unless the system is a router.'

platform: machine


warnings:
    - general: |-
        There might be cases when certain applications can systematically override this option.
        One such case is {{{ weblink("https://libvirt.org/", "Libvirt") }}}; a toolkit for managing of virtualization platforms.
        By default, Libvirt requires IP forwarding to be enabled to facilitate
        network communication between the virtualization host and guest
        machines. It enables IP forwarding after every reboot.
