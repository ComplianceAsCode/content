    Accepting "secure" ICMP redirects (from those gateways listed as
    default gateways) has few legitimate uses. It should be disabled unless it is
    absolutely required.

    The runtime status of the  net.ipv4.conf.all.secure_redirects  kernel parameter can be queried
    by running the following command:
     $ sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.secure_redirects
    The output of the command should indicate a value of  0 .
    The preferable way how to assure the runtime compliance is to have
    correct persistent configuration, and rebooting the system.

    The persistent kernel parameter configuration is performed by specifying the appropriate
    assignment in any file located in the  /etc/sysctl.d  directory.
    Verify that there is not any existing incorrect configuration by executing the following command:
     $ grep -r '^\s*net.ipv4.conf.all.secure_redirects\s*=' /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d
    If any assignments other than
     net.ipv4.conf.all.secure_redirects = 0
    are found, or the correct assignment is duplicated, remove those offending lines from respective files,
    and make sure that exactly one file in
     /etc/sysctl.d  contains  net.ipv4.conf.all.secure_redirects = 0 , and that one assignment
    is returned when
     $ grep -r net.ipv4.conf.all.secure_redirects /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d
    is executed.


    If the correct value is not returned, then this is a finding.
