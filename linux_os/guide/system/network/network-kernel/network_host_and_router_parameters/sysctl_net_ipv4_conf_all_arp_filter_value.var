title: net.ipv4.conf.default.arp_filter

description: |-
    Controls whether the ARP filter is enabled or not.

    1 - Allows you to have multiple network interfaces on the same subnet, and have the ARPs for each
    interface be answered based on whether or not the kernel would route a packet from the ARPâ€™d IP out that interface.
    In other words it allows control of which cards (usually 1) will respond to an ARP request.

    0 - (default) The kernel can respond to arp requests with addresses from other interfaces.
    This may seem wrong but it usually makes sense, because it increases the chance of successful communication.
    IP addresses are owned by the complete host on Linux, not by particular interfaces.
