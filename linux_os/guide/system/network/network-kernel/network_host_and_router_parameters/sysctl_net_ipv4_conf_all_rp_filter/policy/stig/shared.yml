    {{{ full_name }}} must use reverse path filtering on all IPv4 interfaces.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Enabling reverse path filtering drops packets with source addresses
    that should not have been able to be received on the interface they were
    received on. It should not be used on systems which are routers for
    complicated networks, but is helpful for end hosts and routers serving small
    networks.

    Verify {{{ full_name }}} uses reverse path filtering on all IPv4 interfaces with the following commands:

    $ sudo sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter

    net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1

    If the returned line does not have a value of "1", or a line is not returned, this is a finding.

    Check that the configuration files are present to enable this network parameter.

    $ { /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysctl --cat-config; cat /etc/sysctl.conf; } | egrep -v '^(#|$)' | grep -F net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter | tail -1

    net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1

    If "net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter" is not set to "1" or is missing, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to use reverse path filtering on all IPv4 interfaces.

    Add or edit the following line in a single system configuration file, in the "/etc/sysctl.d/" directory:

    net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1

    The system configuration files need to be reloaded for the changes to take effect. To reload the contents of the files, run the following command:

    $ sudo sysctl --system
