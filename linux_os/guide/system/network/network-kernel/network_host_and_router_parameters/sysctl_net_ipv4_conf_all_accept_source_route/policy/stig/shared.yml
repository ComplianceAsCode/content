srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must not forward Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) source-routed packets.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Source-routed packets allow the source of the packet to suggest routers
    forward the packet along a different path than configured on the router,
    which can be used to bypass network security measures. This requirement
    applies only to the forwarding of source-routerd traffic, such as when IPv4
    forwarding is enabled and the system is functioning as a router.



    Accepting source-routed packets in the IPv4 protocol has few legitimate
    uses. It should be disabled unless it is absolutely required.

checktext: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} will not accept IPv4 source-routed packets.

    Check the value of the all "accept_source_route" variables with the following command:

    $ sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route

    net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0

    If the returned line does not have a value of "0", a line is not returned, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.

    Check that the configuration files are present to enable this network parameter.

    $ sudo /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysctl --cat-config | egrep -v '^(#|;)' | grep -F net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route | tail -1

    net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0

    If "net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route" is not set to "0" or is missing, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to ignore IPv4 source-routed packets.

    Add or edit the following line in a single system configuration file, in the "/etc/sysctl.d/" directory:

    net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route = 0

    Load settings from all system configuration files with the following command:

    $ sudo sysctl --system
