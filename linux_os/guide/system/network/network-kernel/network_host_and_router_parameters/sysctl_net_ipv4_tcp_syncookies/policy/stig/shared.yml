    {{{ full_name }}} must be configured to use TCP syncookies.

    DoS is a condition when a resource is not available for legitimate users. When this occurs, the organization either cannot accomplish its mission or must operate at degraded capacity.

    Managing excess capacity ensures that sufficient capacity is available to counter flooding attacks. Employing increased capacity and service redundancy may reduce the susceptibility to some DoS attacks. Managing excess capacity may include, for example, establishing selected usage priorities, quotas, or partitioning.

    Verify {{{ full_name }}} is configured to use IPv4 TCP syncookies.

    Check to see if syncookies are used with the following command:

    Check the status of the kernel.perf_event_paranoid kernel parameter.

    $ sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies

    net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1

    Check that the configuration files are present to enable this kernel parameter.

    $ sudo /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysctl --cat-config | egrep -v '^(#|;)' | grep -F net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies | tail -1
    net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1

    If the network parameter "ipv4.tcp_syncookies" is not equal to "1" or nothing is returned, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to use TCP syncookies.

    Add or edit the following line in a system configuration file in the "/etc/sysctl.d/" directory:
     net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1

     Load settings from all system configuration files with the following command:

     $ sudo sysctl --system
