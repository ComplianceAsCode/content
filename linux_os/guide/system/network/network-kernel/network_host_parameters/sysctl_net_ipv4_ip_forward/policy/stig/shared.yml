srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must not enable IPv4 packet forwarding unless the system is a router.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Routing protocol daemons are typically used on routers to exchange
    network topology information with other routers. If this capability is used when
    not required, system network information may be unnecessarily transmitted across
    the network.

checktext: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} is not performing IPv4 packet forwarding, unless the system is a router.

    Check that IPv4 forwarding is disabled using the following command:

    $ sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward

    net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0

    If the IPv4 forwarding value is not "0" and is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, this is a finding.

    Check that the configuration files are present to enable this network parameter.

    $ { /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysctl --cat-config; cat /etc/sysctl.conf; } | egrep -v '^(#|$)' | grep -F net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding | tail -1

    net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding = 0

    If "net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding" is not set to "0" and is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, or is missing, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to not allow IPv4 packet forwarding, unless the system is a router.

    Add or edit the following line in a single system configuration file, in the "/etc/sysctl.d/" directory:

    net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=0

    Load settings from all system configuration files with the following command:

    $ sudo sysctl --system
