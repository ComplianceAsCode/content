title: 'Only Allow specific PKI-established CAs'

description: |-
    The operating system must only allow the use of trusted PKI-established
    certificate authorities for verification of the establishment of
    protected sessions.

rationale: |-
    Untrusted Certificate Authorities (CA) can issue certificates, but they
    may be issued by organizations or individuals that seek to compromise
    systems or by organizations with insufficient security controls. If
    the CA used for verifying the certificate is not a approved CA,
    trust of this CA has not been established.
    The Environment shall only accept PKI-certificates obtained from a approved
    internal or external certificate authority. Reliance on CAs for the
    establishment of secure sessions includes, for example, the use of
    SSL/TLS certificates.

severity: medium
identifiers:
    cce@ocp4: CCE-87411-5
    cce@rhcos4: CCE-87849-6
    cce@rhel9: CCE-89013-7

ocil_clause: non-trusted CA is installed in the system

ocil: |-
    To check which CAs are trusted in your system, use
{{% if 'ocp4' == product %}}
    <code>$ oc get proxy cluster </code> to see, which configmap is referenced and use
    <code>$ oc get configmap custom-ca -n openshift-config </code> to list the CAs
{{% elif 'rhcos4' == product %}}
    <code>$ for node in $(oc get node -oname); do oc debug $node -- chroot /host /bin/bash -c 'echo -n "$HOSTNAME "; trust list';done </code>
{{% else %}}
    <code>$ trust list --filter ca-anchors </code> on the Operating System
{{% endif %}}
    and manually compare the supplied list with your internal list of allowed Certificate Authorities

fixtext: |-
{{% if 'ocp4' == product %}}
    Create a configmap and reference it by the proxy cluster object following the guidance here {{ weblink(link=https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/latest/html/networking/enable-cluster-wide-proxy#nw-proxy-configure-object_config-cluster-wide-proxy) }}
{{% elif 'rhcos4' == product %}}
    Due to the immutable nature of RHCOS4 it is not possible to remove CAs. Instead you should blacklist them using a MachineConfigObject following the guidance here {{ weblink(link=https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6963204) }}
{{% else %}}
    To remove CAs use
    <code> $ trust anchor --remove "pkcs11:id=<%AA%BB%CC%DD%EE>;type=cert" </code> after
    getting the id with <code> $ trust list </code>
{{% endif %}}
