title: 'Only Allow DoD PKI-established CAs'

description: |-
    The operating system must only allow the use of DoD PKI-established
    certificate authorities for verification of the establishment of
    protected sessions.

rationale: |-
    Untrusted Certificate Authorities (CA) can issue certificates, but they
    may be issued by organizations or individuals that seek to compromise
    DoD systems or by organizations with insufficient security controls. If
    the CA used for verifying the certificate is not a DoD-approved CA,
    trust of this CA has not been established.
    The DoD will only accept PKI-certificates obtained from a DoD-approved
    internal or external certificate authority. Reliance on CAs for the
    establishment of secure sessions includes, for example, the use of
    SSL/TLS certificates.
