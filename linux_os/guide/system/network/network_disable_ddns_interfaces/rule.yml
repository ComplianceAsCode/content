title: 'Disable Client Dynamic DNS Updates'

description: |-
    Dynamic DNS allows clients to dynamically update their own DNS records.
    The updates are transmitted by unencrypted means which can reveal information
    to a potential malicious user. If the system does not require Dynamic DNS,
    remove all <tt>DHCP_HOSTNAME</tt> references from the
    <tt>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<i>interface</i></tt> scripts. If
    <tt>dhclient</tt> is used, remove all <tt>send host-name <i>hostname</i></tt>
    references from the <tt>/etc/dhclient.conf</tt> configuration file and/or any
    reference from the <tt>/etc/dhcp</tt> directory.

rationale: |-
    Dynamic DNS updates transmit unencrypted information about a system
    including its name and address and should not be used unless needed.

ocil_clause: 'client Dynamic DNS updates are not disabled'

ocil: |-
    To verify that clients cannot automatically update DNS records, perform the
    following:
    <pre>$ grep -i dhcp_hostname /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-*</pre>
    <pre>$ grep -rni "send host-name" /etc/dhclient.conf /etc/dhcp</pre>
    The output should return no results.
