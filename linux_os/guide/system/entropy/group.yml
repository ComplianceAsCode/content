title: 'Protect Random-Number Entropy Pool'

description: |-
    The I/O operations of the Linux kernel block layer due to their inherently
    unpredictable execution times have been traditionally considered as a reliable
    source to contribute to random-number entropy pool of the Linux kernel. This
    has changed with introduction of solid-state storage devices (SSDs) though.
