title: 'Ensure Solid State Drives Do Not Contribute To Random-Number Entropy Pool'

description: |-
    For each solid-state drive on the system, run:
    <pre> # echo 0 &gt; /sys/block/DRIVE/queue/add_random</pre>

rationale: |-
    In contrast to traditional electromechanical magnetic disks, containing
    spinning disks and / or movable read / write heads, the solid-state storage
    devices (SSDs) do not contain moving / mechanical components. Therefore the
    I/O operation completion times are much more predictable for them.
