title: 'Ensure Logrotate Runs Periodically'

description: |-
    The <tt>logrotate</tt> utility allows for the automatic rotation of
    log files.  The frequency of rotation is specified in <tt>/etc/logrotate.conf</tt>,
    which triggers a cron task.  To configure logrotate to run daily, add or correct
    the following line in <tt>/etc/logrotate.conf</tt>:
    <pre># rotate log files <i>frequency</i>
    daily</pre>

rationale: |-
    Log files that are not properly rotated run the risk of growing so large
    that they fill up the /var/log partition. Valuable logging information could be lost
    if the /var/log partition becomes full.

ocil_clause: 'logrotate is not configured to run daily'

ocil: |-
    To determine the status and frequency of logrotate, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep logrotate /var/log/cron*</pre>
    If logrotate is configured properly, output should include references to
    <tt>/etc/cron.daily</tt>.
