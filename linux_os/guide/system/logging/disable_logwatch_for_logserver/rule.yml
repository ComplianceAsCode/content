title: 'Disable Logwatch on Clients if a Logserver Exists'

description: |-
    Does your site have a central logserver which has been configured to report
    on logs received from all systems? If so:
    <pre>$ sudo rm /etc/cron.daily/0logwatch</pre>
    If no logserver exists, it will be necessary for each system to run
    Logwatch individually. Using a central logserver provides the security and
    reliability benefits discussed earlier, and also makes monitoring logs
    easier and less time-intensive for administrators.
