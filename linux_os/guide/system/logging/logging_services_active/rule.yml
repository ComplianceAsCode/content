title: 'Ensure One Logging Service Is In Use'

description: |-
    Ensure that a logging system is active and in use.
    <pre>
    systemctl is-active rsyslog systemd-journald
    </pre>
    The command should return at least one <tt>active</tt>.

rationale: |-
    The system should have one active logging service to avoid conflicts
    and ensure consistency.

severity: medium

platform: machine

warnings:
    - general: |-
        This rule does not come with a remediation. There are specific rules
        for enabling each logging service which should be enabled instead.
