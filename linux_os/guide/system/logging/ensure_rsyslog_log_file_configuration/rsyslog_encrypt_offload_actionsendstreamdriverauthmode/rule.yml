title: Ensure Rsyslog Authenticates Off-Loaded Audit Records

description: |-
    Rsyslogd is a system utility providing support for message logging. Support
    for both internet and UNIX domain sockets enables this utility to support both local
    and remote logging.  Couple this utility with <tt>gnutls</tt> (which is a secure communications
    library implementing the SSL, TLS and DTLS protocols), and you have a method to securely
    encrypt and off-load auditing.

    When using <tt>rsyslogd</tt> to off-load logs the remote system must be authenticated.

rationale: |-
    The audit records generated by Rsyslog contain valuable information regarding system
    configuration, user authentication, and other such information. Audit records should be
    protected from unauthorized access.

ocil_clause: '$ActionSendStreamDriverAuthMode in /etc/rsyslog.conf is not set to x509/name'

ocil: |-
    Verify the operating system authenticates the remote logging server for off-loading audit logs with the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo grep -i '$ActionSendStreamDriverAuthMode' /etc/rsyslog.conf /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf</pre>
    The output should be
    <pre>$/etc/rsyslog.conf:$ActionSendStreamDriverAuthMode x509/name</pre>
