title: 'Ensure System Log Files Have Correct Permissions'

description: |-
    The file permissions for all log files written by <tt>rsyslog</tt> should
    be set to 600, or more restrictive. These log files are determined by the
    second part of each Rule line in <tt>/etc/rsyslog.conf</tt> and typically
    all appear in <tt>/var/log</tt>. For each log file <i>LOGFILE</i>
    referenced in <tt>/etc/rsyslog.conf</tt>, run the following command to
    inspect the file's permissions:
    <pre>$ ls -l <i>LOGFILE</i></pre>
    If the permissions are not 600 or more restrictive, run the following
    command to correct this:
    <pre>$ sudo chmod 0600 <i>LOGFILE</i></pre>"

rationale: |-
    Log files can contain valuable information regarding system
    configuration. If the system log files are not protected unauthorized
    users could change the logged data, eliminating their forensic value.
