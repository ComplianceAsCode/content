title: 'Ensure remote access methods are monitored in Rsyslog'

description: |-
    Logging of remote access methods must be implemented to help identify cyber
    attacks and ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies are being
    audited and upheld. An examples of a remote access method is the use of the
    Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) from an external, non-organization controlled
    network. The <tt>/etc/rsyslog.conf</tt> or
    <tt>/etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf</tt> file should contain a match for the following
    selectors: <tt>auth.*</tt>, <tt>authpriv.*</tt>, and <tt>daemon.*</tt>. If
    not, use the following as an example configuration:
    <pre>auth.*;authpriv.*;daemon.*                              /var/log/secure</pre>

rationale: |-
    Logging remote access methods can be used to trace the decrease the risks
    associated with remote user access management. It can also be used to spot
    cyber attacks and ensure ongoing compliance with organizational policies
    surrounding the use of remote access methods.

ocil: |-
    To verify that <tt>remote access methods</tt> are logging to <tt>rsyslog</tt>,
    run the following command:
    <pre>grep -rE '(auth.\*|authpriv.\*|daemon.\*)' /etc/rsyslog.*</pre>
    The output should contain <tt>auth.*</tt>, <tt>authpriv.*</tt>, and <tt>daemon.*</tt>
    pointing to a log file.
