    Logging remote access methods can be used to trace the decrease the risks
    associated with remote user access management. It can also be used to spot
    cyber attacks and ensure ongoing compliance with organizational policies
    surrounding the use of remote access methods.

    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} monitors all remote access methods.

    Check that remote access methods are being logged by running the following command:

    $ grep -rE '(auth.\*|authpriv.\*|daemon.\*)' /etc/rsyslog.conf

    /etc/rsyslog.conf:authpriv.*

    If "auth.*", "authpriv.*" or "daemon.*" are not configured to be logged, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Add or update the following lines to the "/etc/rsyslog.conf" file:

    auth.*;authpriv.*;daemon.* /var/log/secure

    The "rsyslog" service must be restarted for the changes to take effect with the following command:

    $ sudo systemctl restart rsyslog.service
