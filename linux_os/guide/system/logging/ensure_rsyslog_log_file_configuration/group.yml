title: 'Ensure Proper Configuration of Log Files'

description: |-
    The file <tt>/etc/rsyslog.conf</tt> controls where log message are written.
    These are controlled by lines called <i>rules</i>, which consist of a
    <i>selector</i> and an <i>action</i>.
    These rules are often customized depending on the role of the system, the
    requirements of the environment, and whatever may enable
    the administrator to most effectively make use of log data.
    The default rules in {{{ full_name }}} are:
    <pre>*.info;mail.none;authpriv.none;cron.none                /var/log/messages
    authpriv.*                                              /var/log/secure
    mail.*                                                  -/var/log/maillog
    cron.*                                                  /var/log/cron
    *.emerg                                                 *
    uucp,news.crit                                          /var/log/spooler
    local7.*                                                /var/log/boot.log</pre>
    See the man page <tt>rsyslog.conf(5)</tt> for more information.
    <i>Note that the <tt>rsyslog</tt> daemon can be configured to use a timestamp format that
    some log processing programs may not understand. If this occurs,
    edit the file <tt>/etc/rsyslog.conf</tt> and add or edit the following line:</i>
    <pre>$ ActionFileDefaultTemplate RSYSLOG_TraditionalFileFormat</pre>
