title: 'Ensure <tt>cron</tt> Is Logging To Rsyslog'

description: |-
    Cron logging must be implemented to spot intrusions or trace
    cron job status. If <tt>cron</tt> is not logging to <tt>rsyslog</tt>, it
    can be implemented by adding the following to the <i>RULES</i> section of
    <tt>/etc/rsyslog.conf</tt>:
    <pre>cron.*                                                  /var/log/cron</pre>

rationale: |-
    Cron logging can be used to trace the successful or unsuccessful execution
    of cron jobs. It can also be used to spot intrusions into the use of the cron
    facility by unauthorized and malicious users.

ocil: |-
    To verify that <tt>cron</tt> is logging to <tt>rsyslog</tt>,
    run the following command:
    <pre>grep -rni "cron\.\*" /etc/rsyslog.*</pre>
    The output should return some similar to:
    <pre>cron.*                                                  /var/log/cron</pre>
