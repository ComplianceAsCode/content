title: 'Ensure logging is configured'

description: |-
    The <tt>/etc/rsyslog.conf</tt> and <tt>/etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf</tt> files
    specifies rules for logging and which files are to be used to log certain
    classes of messages.

rationale: |-
    A great deal of important security-related information is sent via
    rsyslog (e.g., successful and failed su attempts, failed login attempts,
    root login attempts, etc.).

severity: medium

identifiers:
    cce@sle12: CCE-92379-7
    cce@sle15: CCE-92497-7

references:
    cis@sle12: 4.2.1.4
    cis@sle15: 4.2.1.4

ocil_clause: 'no logging is configured'

ocil: |-
    Review the contents of the <tt>/etc/rsyslog.conf</tt> and <tt>/etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf</tt>
    files to ensure appropriate logging is set. In addition, run the following command:
    <pre>ls -l /var/log/</pre>
    and verify that the log files are logging information

fixtext: |-
    Configure logging with selectors covering each priority. An example log configuration can be
    the following content of <tt>/etc/rsyslog.conf</tt> and <tt>/etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf</tt> files:
    <pre>
    *.emerg                        :omusrmsg:*
    auth,authpriv.*                /var/log/secure
    mail.*                         -/var/log/mail
    mail.info                      -/var/log/mail.info
    mail.warning                   -/var/log/mail.warn
    mail.err                       /var/log/mail.err
    news.crit                      -/var/log/news/news.crit
    news.err                       -/var/log/news/news.err
    news.notice                    -/var/log/news/news.notice
    *.=warning;*.=err              -/var/log/warn
    *.crit                         /var/log/warn
    *.*;mail.none;news.none        -/var/log/messages
    local0,local1.*                -/var/log/localmessages
    local2,local3.*                -/var/log/localmessages
    local4,local5.*                -/var/log/localmessages
    local6,local7.*                -/var/log/localmessages
    </pre>
    To apply new settings use command:
    <pre>systemctl restart rsyslog </pre>

warnings:
    - general: |-
        This rule does not come with remediation as there is no one way to solve the problem, and
        the requirement from CIS specification does not require one particular way, but persuades
        the system administrator to perform configuration suitable for the specific environment.
        This also means that the OVAL check is too generic, and the user most probably should
        perform additional manual verification.
