title: 'Configure Logwatch HostLimit Line'

description: |-
    On a central logserver, you want Logwatch to summarize all syslog entries,
    including those which did not originate on the logserver itself. The
    <tt>HostLimit</tt> setting tells Logwatch to report on all hosts, not just
    the one on which it is running.
    <pre> HostLimit = no </pre>
