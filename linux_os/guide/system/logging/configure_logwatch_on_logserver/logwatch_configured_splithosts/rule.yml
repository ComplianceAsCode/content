description: "If <tt>SplitHosts</tt> is set, Logwatch will separate entries by hostname. This makes the report longer but significantly \nmore usable. If it is not set, then Logwatch will not report which host generated a given log entry, and that \ninformation is almost always necessary\n<pre> SplitHosts = yes </pre>"
