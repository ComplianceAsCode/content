title: 'Configure Logwatch SplitHosts Line'

description: |-
    If <tt>SplitHosts</tt> is set, Logwatch will separate entries by hostname.
    This makes the report longer but significantly more usable. If it is not
    set, then Logwatch will not report which host generated a given log entry,
    and that information is almost always necessary
    <pre> SplitHosts = yes </pre>
