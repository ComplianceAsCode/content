title: 'Configure TLS for rsyslog remote logging'

description: |-
    Configure <tt>rsyslog</tt> to use Transport Layer
    Security (TLS) support for logging to remote server
    for the Forwarding Output Module in <tt>/etc/rsyslog.conf</tt>
    using action. You can use the following command:
    <pre>echo 'action(type="omfwd" protocol="tcp" Target="&lt;remote system>" port="6514"
        StreamDriver="gtls" StreamDriverMode="1" StreamDriverAuthMode="x509/name")' >> /etc/rsyslog.conf
    </pre>
    Replace the <tt>&lt;remote system></tt> in the above command with an IP address or a host name of the remote logging server.

rationale: |-
    For protection of data being logged, the connection to the
    remote logging server needs to be authenticated and encrypted.

ocil_clause: 'omfwd is not configured with gtls and AuthMode'

ocil: |-
    To verify that rsyslog's Forwarding Output Module is configured
    to use TLS for logging to remote server, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep omfwd /etc/rsyslog.conf /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf</pre>
    The output should include record similar to
    <pre>action(type="omfwd" protocol="tcp" Target="&lt;remote system>" port="6514"
        StreamDriver="gtls" StreamDriverMode="1" StreamDriverAuthMode="x509/name")
    </pre>
    where the <tt>&lt;remote system></tt> present in the configuration line above must be a valid IP address or a host name of the remote logging server.
