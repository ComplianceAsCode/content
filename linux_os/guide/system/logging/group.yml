title: 'Configure Syslog'

description: |-
    The syslog service has been the default Unix logging mechanism for
    many years. It has a number of downsides, including inconsistent log format,
    lack of authentication for received messages, and lack of authentication,
    encryption, or reliable transport for messages sent over a network. However,
    due to its long history, syslog is a de facto standard which is supported by
    almost all Unix applications.
    <br />
    <br />
    In {{{ full_name }}}, rsyslog has replaced ksyslogd as the
    syslog daemon of choice, and it includes some additional security features
    such as reliable, connection-oriented (i.e. TCP) transmission of logs, the
    option to log to database formats, and the encryption of log data en route to
    a central logging server.
    This section discusses how to configure rsyslog for
    best effect, and how to use tools provided with the system to maintain and
    monitor logs.
