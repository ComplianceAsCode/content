title: 'Ensure real-time clock is set to UTC'

description: 'Ensure that the system real-time clock (RTC) is set to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).'

rationale: |-
    If time stamps are not consistently applied and there is no common
    time reference, it is difficult to perform forensic analysis.

    Time stamps generated by the operating system include date and time.
    Time is commonly expressed in UTC, a modern continuation of GMT, or
    local time with an offset from UTC.

ocil: |-
    To verify that the system real-time clock is set to UTC, run the following command:
    <pre>$ timedatectl status</pre>
    The <tt>RTC in local TZ</tt> output should show <tt>no</tt> and the <tt>RTC time</tt>
    should be the same as the <tt>Universal time</tt>.
    If the RTC is set to the local time zone, use the following command to use UTC again:
    <pre>$ sudo timedatectl set-local-rtc 0</pre>
