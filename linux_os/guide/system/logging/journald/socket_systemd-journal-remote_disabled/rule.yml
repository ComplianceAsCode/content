title: 'Disable systemd-journal-remote Socket'

description: |-
    Journald supports the ability to receive messages from remote hosts,
    thus acting as a log server. Clients should not receive data from
    other hosts.
    NOTE:
        The same package, systemd-journal-remote , is used for both sending
        logs to remote hosts and receiving incoming logs.
        With regards to receiving logs, there are two Systemd unit files;
        systemd-journal-remote.socket and systemd-journal-remote.service.

rationale: |-
    If a client is configured to also receive data, thus turning it into
    a server, the client system is acting outside it's operational boundary.
