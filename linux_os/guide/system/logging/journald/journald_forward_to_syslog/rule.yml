title: Ensure journald is configured to send logs to rsyslog

description: |-
    Data from journald may be stored in volatile memory or persisted locally.
    Utilities exist to accept remote export of journald logs.

rationale:
    Storing log data on a remote host protects log integrity from local attacks. If an attacker
    gains root access on the local system, they could tamper with or remove log data that is
    stored on the local system.

ocil: |-
    Storing logs remotely protects the integrity of the data from local attacks.
    Run the following command to verify that journald is forwarding logs to a remote host.
    <pre>
    grep "^\sForwardToSyslog" /etc/systemd/journald.conf
    </pre>
    and it should return
    <pre>
    ForwardToSyslog=yes
    </pre>

template:
    name: shell_lineinfile

        path: /etc/systemd/journald.conf
        parameter: ForwardToSyslog
        value: yes
