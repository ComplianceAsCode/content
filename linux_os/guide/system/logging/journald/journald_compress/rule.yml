title: Ensure journald is configured to compress large log files

description: |-
    The journald system can compress large log files to avoid fill the system disk.

rationale:
    Log files that are not properly compressed run the risk of growing so large
    that they fill up the log partition. Valuable logging information could be lost
    if the log partition becomes full.
