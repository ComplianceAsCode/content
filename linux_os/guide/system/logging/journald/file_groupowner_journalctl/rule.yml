title: 'Verify Groupowner on the journalctl command'

description: |-
    Verify that the "journalctl" command is group-owned by "root" by
    using the following command:
    <pre>
    $ sudo find /usr/bin/journalctl -exec stat -c "%n %G" {} \;
    </pre>
    If any output returned is not owned by "root", this is a finding.

rationale: |-
    Only authorized personnel should be aware of errors and the details of the errors.
    Error messages are an indicator of an organization's operational state or can
    identify the operating system or platform. Additionally, personally identifiable
    information (PII) and operational information must not be revealed through error
    messages to unauthorized personnel or their designated representatives.
