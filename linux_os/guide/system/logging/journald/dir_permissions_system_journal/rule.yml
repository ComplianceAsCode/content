title: 'Verify Permissions on the system journal directories'

description: |-
    Verify the /run/log/journal and /var/log/journal directories have
    permissions set to "2750" or less permissive by using the following command:
    <pre>
    $ sudo find /run/log/journal /var/log/journal  -type d -exec stat -c "%n %a" {} \;
    </pre>
    If any output returned has a permission set greater than "2750", this is a finding.

rationale: |-
    Any operating system providing too much information in error messages risks
    compromising the data and security of the structure, and content of error messages
    needs to be carefully considered by the organization.

    Configure the system to set the appropriate permissions to the files and directories
    used by the systemd journal:
    Add or modify the following lines in the "/etc/tmpfiles.d/systemd.conf" file:
    <pre>
    z /run/log/journal 2750 root systemd-journal - -
    Z /run/log/journal/%m ~2750 root systemd-journal - -
    z /var/log/journal 2750 root systemd-journal - -
    z /var/log/journal/%m 2750 root systemd-journal - -
    </pre>
    Restart the system for the changes to take effect.
