title: 'Install systemd-journal-remote Package'

description: |-
    Journald (via systemd-journal-remote ) supports the ability to send
    log events it gathers to a remote log host or to receive messages
    from remote hosts, thus enabling centralised log management.

rationale: |-
    Storing log data on a remote host protects log integrity from local
    attacks. If an attacker gains root access on the local system, they
    could tamper with or remove log data that is stored on the local system.
