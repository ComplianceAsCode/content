title: Ensure journald ForwardToSyslog is disabled

description: |-
    Data from journald should be kept in the confines of the service and not forwarded to other services.

rationale:
    If journald is the method for capturing logs, all logs of the system should be
    handled by journald and not forwarded to other logging mechanisms.

platform: package[systemd]
