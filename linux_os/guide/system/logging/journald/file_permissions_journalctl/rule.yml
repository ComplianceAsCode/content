title: 'Verify Permissions on the journal command'

description: |-
    Verify that the "journalctl" command has a permission set of "740" by
    using the following command:
    <pre>
     $ sudo find /usr/bin/journalctl -exec stat -c "%n %a" {} \;
    </pre>
    If "journalctl" is not set to "740", this is a finding.

rationale: |-
    Any operating system providing too much information in error messages risks
    compromising the data and security of the structure, and content of error messages
    needs to be carefully considered by the organization.
