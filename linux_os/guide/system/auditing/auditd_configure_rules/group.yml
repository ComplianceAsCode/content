title: 'Configure auditd Rules for Comprehensive Auditing'

description: |-
    The <tt>auditd</tt> program can perform comprehensive
    monitoring of system activity. This section describes recommended
    configuration settings for comprehensive auditing, but a full
    description of the auditing system's capabilities is beyond the
    scope of this guide. The mailing list <i>linux-audit@redhat.com</i> exists
    to facilitate community discussion of the auditing system.
    <br /><br />
    The audit subsystem supports extensive collection of events, including:
    <br />
    <ul>
    <li>Tracing of arbitrary system calls (identified by name or number)
    on entry or exit.</li>
    <li>Filtering by PID, UID, call success, system call argument (with
    some limitations), etc.</li>
    <li>Monitoring of specific files for modifications to the file's
    contents or metadata.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    Auditing rules at startup are controlled by the file <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt>.
    Add rules to it to meet the auditing requirements for your organization.
    Each line in <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> represents a series of arguments
    that can be passed to <tt>auditctl</tt> and can be individually tested
    during runtime. See documentation in <tt>/usr/share/doc/audit-<i>VERSION</i></tt> and
    in the related man pages for more details.
    <br /><br />
    If copying any example audit rulesets from <tt>/usr/share/doc/audit-VERSION</tt>,
    be sure to comment out the
    lines containing <tt>arch=</tt> which are not appropriate for your system's
    architecture. Then review and understand the following rules,
    ensuring rules are activated as needed for the appropriate
    architecture.
    <br /><br />
    After reviewing all the rules, reading the following sections, and
    editing as needed, the new rules can be activated as follows:
    <pre>$ sudo service auditd restart</pre>
