title: 'Record Events When Executables Are Run As Another User'

description: |-
    Verify the system generates an audit record when actions are run as another user.
    sudo provides users with temporary elevated privileges to perform operations, either as the superuser or another user.

    If audit is using the "auditctl" tool to load the rules, run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo grep execve /etc/audit/audit.rules</pre>

    If audit is using the "augenrules" tool to load the rules, run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo grep -r execve /etc/audit/rules.d</pre>
    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S execve -C euid!=uid -F auid!=unset -k user_emulation</pre>
    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b64  S execve -C euid!=uid -F auid!=unset -k user_emulation</pre>

    If both the "b32" and "b64" audit rules for "SUID" files are not defined, this is a finding.

rationale: |-
    Creating an audit log of users with temporary elevated privileges and the
    operation(s) they performed is essential to reporting. Administrators will
    want to correlate the events written to the audit trail with the records
    written to sudo's logfile to verify if unauthorized commands have
    been executed.
    Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by
    authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have
    compromised information system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern
    and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. Auditing the use
    of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse and identify the
    risk from insider threats and the advanced persistent threat.

        number of ways while still achieving the desired effect.

ocil: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} audits execution as another user.

    Check if {{{ full_name }}} is configured to audit the execution of the "execve" system call using the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo grep execve /etc/audit/audit.rules</pre>

    The output should be the following:

    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S execve -C euid!=uid -F auid!=unset -k user_emulation</pre>
    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve  -C euid!=uid -F auid!=unset-k user_emulation</pre>

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to audit the execution of the "execve" system call.

    Add or update the following rules to "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules":

    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S execve -C euid!=uid -F auid!=unset -k user_emulation</pre>
    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -C euid!=uid -F auid!=unset -k user_emulation</pre>

    The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
