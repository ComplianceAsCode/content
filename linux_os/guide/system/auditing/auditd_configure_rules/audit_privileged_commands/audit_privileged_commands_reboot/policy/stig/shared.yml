    Verify that an audit event is generated for any successful/unsuccessful use of the reboot command by performing the following command to check the file system rules in "/etc/audit/audit.rules":

    $ sudo grep -w reboot /etc/audit/audit.rules

    -a always,exit -F path=/usr/sbin/reboot -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k privileged-reboot

    If the command does not return a line, or the line is commented out, then this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the audit system to generate an audit event for any successful/unsuccessful uses of the "reboot" command by adding or updating the following rule in the "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules" file:

    -a always,exit -F path=/usr/sbin/reboot -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k privileged-reboot
