title: 'Ensure auditd Collects Information on the Use of Privileged Commands - kmod'

description: |-
    At a minimum, the audit system should collect the execution of
    privileged commands for all users and root. If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is
    configured to use the <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules during
    daemon startup (the default), add a line of the following form to a file with
    suffix <tt>.rules</tt> in the directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>:
    <pre>-w /usr/bin/kmod -p x -k modules</pre>
    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>
    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add a line of the following
    form to <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt>:
    <pre>-w /usr/bin/kmod -p x -k modules</pre>

rationale: |-
    Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and
    mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish,
    correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify
    those responsible for one.

    Audit records can be generated from various components within the
    information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

ocil: |-
    To verify that auditing of privileged command use is configured, run the
    following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep rmmod /etc/audit/audit.rules /etc/audit/rules.d/*</pre>
    It should return a relevant line in the audit rules.
