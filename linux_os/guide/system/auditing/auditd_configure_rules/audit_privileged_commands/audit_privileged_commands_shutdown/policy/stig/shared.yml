srg_requirement: |-
    Successful/unsuccessful uses of the shutdown command in {{{ full_name }}} must generate an audit record.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Misuse of the shutdown command may cause availability issues for the system.

checktext: |-
    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} is configured to audit the execution of the "shutdown" command with the following command:

    $ sudo auditctl -l | grep shutdown

    -a always,exit -F path=/usr/sbin/shutdown -F perm=x -F auid&gt=1000 -F auid!=unset -k privileged-shutdown

    If the command does not return a line, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the audit system to generate an audit event for any successful/unsuccessful uses of the "shutdown" command by adding or updating the following rule in the "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules" file:

    -a always,exit -F path=/usr/sbin/shutdown -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k privileged-shutdown

    The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
