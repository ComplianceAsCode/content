title: 'Ensure auditd Collects Information on the Use of Privileged Commands - fdisk'

description: |-
    Configure the operating system to audit the execution of the partition
    management program "fdisk".

rationale: |-
    Without generating audit records that are specific to the security
    and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to
    establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an
    incident or identify those responsible for one.
    Audit records can be generated from various components within the
    information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

    To verify that auditing of privileged command use is configured, run the
    following command:

    <pre>$ sudo auditctl -l | grep fdisk
    -w /sbin/fdisk -p x -k fdisk </pre>

    If the command does not return a line, or the line is commented out, this
    is a finding.
