title: 'Record Any Attempts to Run chacl'

description: |-
    At a minimum, the audit system should collect any execution attempt
    of the <tt>chacl</tt> command for all users and root. If the <tt>auditd</tt>
    daemon is configured to use the <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules
    during daemon startup (the default), add the following lines to a file with suffix
    <tt>.rules</tt> in the directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>:
    <pre>-a always,exit -F path=/usr/bin/chacl -F perm=x -F auid&gt;={{{ auid }}} -F auid!=unset -k prim_mod</pre>
    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>
    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following lines to
    <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file:
    <pre>-a always,exit -F path=/usr/bin/chacl -F perm=x -F auid&gt;={{{ auid }}} -F auid!=unset -k prim_mod</pre>

rationale: |-
    Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and
    mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish,
    correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify
    those responsible for one.

    Audit records can be generated from various components within the
    information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

ocil: |-
    To verify that execution of the command is being audited, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep "path=/usr/bin/chacl" /etc/audit/audit.rules /etc/audit/rules.d/*</pre>
    The output should return something similar to:
    <pre>-a always,exit -F path=/usr/bin/chacl -F perm=x -F auid&gt;={{{ auid }}} -F auid!=unset -k prim_mod</pre>
