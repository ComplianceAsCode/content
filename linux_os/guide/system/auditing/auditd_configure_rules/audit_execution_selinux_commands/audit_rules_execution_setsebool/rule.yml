title: 'Record Any Attempts to Run setsebool'

description: |-
    At a minimum, the audit system should collect any execution attempt
    of the <tt>setsebool</tt> command for all users and root. If the <tt>auditd</tt>
    daemon is configured to use the <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules
    during daemon startup (the default), add the following lines to a file with suffix
    <tt>.rules</tt> in the directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>:
    <pre>-a always,exit -F path=/usr/sbin/setsebool {{{ perm_x }}}-F auid&gt;={{{ auid }}} -F auid!=unset -F key=privileged</pre>
    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>
    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following lines to
    <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file:
    <pre>-a always,exit -F path=/usr/sbin/setsebool {{{ perm_x }}}-F auid&gt;={{{ auid }}} -F auid!=unset -F key=privileged</pre>

rationale: |-
    Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by
    authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised system accounts,
    is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations.
    Auditing the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse and identify
    the risk from insider and advanced persistent threats.
    <br /><br />
    Privileged programs are subject to escalation-of-privilege attacks,
    which attempt to subvert their normal role of providing some necessary but
    limited capability. As such, motivation exists to monitor these programs for
    unusual activity.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Without the capability to generate audit records, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

    Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

    The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is capable of generating audit records.

    DoD has defined the list of events for which the operating system will provide an audit record generation capability as the following:

    1) Successful and unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete privileges, security objects, security levels, or categories of information (e.g., classification levels);

    2) Access actions, such as successful and unsuccessful logon attempts, privileged activities or other system-level access, starting and ending time for user access to the system, concurrent logons from different workstations, successful and unsuccessful accesses to objects, all program initiations, and all direct access to the information system;

    3) All account creations, modifications, disabling, and terminations; and

    4) All kernel module load, unload, and restart actions.
