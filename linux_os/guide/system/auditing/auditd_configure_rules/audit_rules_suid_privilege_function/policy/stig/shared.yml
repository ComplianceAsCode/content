    The {{{ full_name }}} audit system must be configured to audit the execution of privileged functions and prevent all software from executing at higher privilege levels than users executing the software.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by
    authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have
    compromised information system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern
    and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. Auditing the use
    of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse and identify the
    risk from insider threats and the advanced persistent threat.

checktext: |-
    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} is configured to audit the execution of the "execve" system call with the following command:

    $ sudo auditctl -l | grep execve

    -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S execve -C uid!=euid -F euid=0 -k execpriv
    -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -C uid!=euid -F euid=0 -k execpriv
    -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S execve -C gid!=egid -F egid=0 -k execpriv
    -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -C gid!=egid -F egid=0 -k execpriv

    If the command does not return all lines, or the lines are commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to audit the execution of the "execve" system call.

    Add or update the following file system rules to "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules":

    -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S execve -C uid!=euid -F euid=0 -k execpriv
    -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -C uid!=euid -F euid=0 -k execpriv
    -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S execve -C gid!=egid -F egid=0 -k execpriv
    -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -C gid!=egid -F egid=0 -k execpriv

    The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
