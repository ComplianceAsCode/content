title: 'Record Attempts to Alter Logon and Logout Events'

description: |-
    The audit system already collects login information for all users
    and root. If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the
    <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules during daemon startup (the
    default), add the following lines to a file with suffix <tt>.rules</tt> in the
    directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt> in order to watch for attempted manual
    edits of files involved in storing logon events:
    <pre>-w /var/log/tallylog -p wa -k logins
    -w /var/run/faillock/ -p wa -k logins
    -w /var/log/lastlog -p wa -k logins</pre>
    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>
    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following lines to
    <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file in order to watch for unattempted manual
    edits of files involved in storing logon events:
    <pre>-w /var/log/tallylog -p wa -k logins
    -w /var/run/faillock/ -p wa -k logins
    -w /var/log/lastlog -p wa -k logins</pre>
