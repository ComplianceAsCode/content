title: 'Record Attempts to Alter Logon and Logout Events - faillog'

description: |-
    The audit system already collects login information for all users
    and root. If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the
    <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules during daemon startup (the
    default), add the following lines to a file with suffix <tt>.rules</tt> in the
    directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt> in order to watch for attempted manual
    edits of files involved in storing logon events:
    <pre>-w /var/log/faillog -p wa -k logins</pre>
    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>
    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following lines to
    <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file in order to watch for unattempted manual
    edits of files involved in storing logon events:
    <pre>-w /var/log/faillog -p wa -k logins</pre>

rationale: |-
    Manual editing of these files may indicate nefarious activity, such
    as an attacker attempting to remove evidence of an intrusion.

    To verify that auditing is configured for system administrator actions, run the following command:
    Configure the operating system to generate an audit record for any all modifications to the "faillog" file occur.
    Add or update the following rules in the "/etc/audit/audit.rules" file:
    -w /var/log/faillog -p wa -k logins
    The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
    # sudo systemctl restart auditd.service
