title: 'Record Attempts to Alter Failed Logon and Logout Events - faillog'

description: |-
    The audit system already collects login information for all users
    and root. If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the
    <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules during daemon startup (the
    default), add the following lines to a file with suffix <tt>.rules</tt> in the
    directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt> in order to watch for attempted manual
    edits of files involved in storing failed logon events:
    <pre>-w /var/log/faillog -p wa -k logins</pre>
    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>
    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following lines to
    <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file in order to watch for unattempted manual
    edits of files involved in storing failed logon events:
    <pre>-w /var/log/faillog -p wa -k logins</pre>

rationale: |-
    Manual editing of these files may indicate nefarious activity, such
    as an attacker attempting to remove evidence of an intrusion.

    To verify that auditing is configured for system administrator actions, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo auditctl -l | grep "watch=/var/log/faillog\|-w /var/log/faillog"</pre>
