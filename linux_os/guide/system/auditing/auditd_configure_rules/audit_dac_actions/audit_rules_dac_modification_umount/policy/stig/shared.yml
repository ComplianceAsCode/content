    Successful/unsuccessful uses of the umount system call in {{{ full_name }}} must generate an audit record.

    The changing of file permissions could indicate that a user is attempting to
    gain access to information that would otherwise be disallowed. Auditing DAC modifications
    can facilitate the identification of patterns of abuse among both authorized and
    unauthorized users.

    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} generates an audit record for all uses of the "umount" and system call.
    To determine if the system is configured to audit calls to the
    "umount" system call, run the following command:
     $ sudo grep "umount" /etc/audit/audit.*
    If the system is configured to audit this activity, it will return a line like the following.
    -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S umount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k privileged-umount

    If the command does not return a line, or the line is commented out, then this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the audit system to generate an audit event for any successful/unsuccessful use of the "umount" system call by adding or updating the following rules in "/etc/audit/audit.rules" and adding the following rules to "/etc/audit/rules.d/perm_mod.rules" or updating the existing rules in files in the "/etc/audit/rules.d/" directory:

    -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S umount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k perm_mod -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S umount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k perm_mod
    The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
