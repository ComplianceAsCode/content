title: 'Record Events that Modify the System''s Discretionary Access Controls - umount'

description: |-
    At a minimum, the audit system should collect file system umount
    changes. If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured
    to use the <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules during daemon
    startup (the default), add the following line to a file with suffix
    <tt>.rules</tt> in the directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>:
    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S umount -F auid&gt;={{{ auid }}} -F auid!=unset -F key=perm_mod</pre>
    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>
    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following line to
    <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file:
    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S umount -F auid&gt;={{{ auid }}} -F auid!=unset -F key=perm_mod</pre>

rationale: |-
    The changing of file permissions could indicate that a user is attempting to
    gain access to information that would otherwise be disallowed. Auditing DAC modifications
    can facilitate the identification of patterns of abuse among both authorized and
    unauthorized users.

ocil: |-
    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} generates an audit record for all uses of the "umount" and system call.
    To determine if the system is configured to audit calls to the
    "umount" system call, run the following command:
    <pre space="preserve">$ sudo grep "umount" /etc/audit/audit.*</pre>
    If the system is configured to audit this activity, it will return a line like the following.
    -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S umount -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k privileged-umount

warnings:
    - general: |-
        Note that these rules can be configured in a
        number of ways while still achieving the desired effect. Here the system calls
        have been placed independent of other system calls. Grouping these system
        calls with others as identifying earlier in this guide is more efficient.
