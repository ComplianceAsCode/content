     Successful/unsuccessful uses of the fchmodat system call in {{{ full_name }}} must generate an audit record.

    The changing of file permissions could indicate that a user is attempting to
    gain access to information that would otherwise be disallowed. Auditing DAC modifications
    can facilitate the identification of patterns of abuse among both authorized and
    unauthorized users.

    To determine if the system is configured to audit calls to the
     fchmodat  system call, run the following command:
     $ sudo grep "fchmodat" /etc/audit/audit.*
    If the system is configured to audit this activity, it will return a line.


    If no line is returned, then this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the audit system to generate an audit event for any successful/unsuccessful use of the "fchmodat" system call by adding or updating the following rules in the "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules" file:
    -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S fchmodat -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k perm_mod
    -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S fchmodat -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k perm_mod

    It's allowed to group this system call within the same line as "chmod", "fchmod" and "fchmodat".

    The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
