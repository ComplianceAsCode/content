title: 'Record Events When Privileged Executables Are Run CIS'

description: |-
    Verify the system generates an audit record when privileged functions are executed.

    If audit is using the "auditctl" tool to load the rules, run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo grep execve /etc/audit/audit.rules</pre>

    If audit is using the "augenrules" tool to load the rules, run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo grep -r execve /etc/audit/rules.d</pre>
    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S execve -C euid!=uid -F auid!=unset -k user_emulation</pre>
    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b64  S execve -C euid!=uid -F auid!=unset -k user_emulation</pre>

    If both the "b32" and "b64" audit rules for "SUID" files are not defined, this is a finding.

rationale: |-
    Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by
    authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have
    compromised information system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern
    and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. Auditing the use
    of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse and identify the
    risk from insider threats and the advanced persistent threat.

        Note that these rules can be configured in a
        number of ways while still achieving the desired effect.

ocil: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} audits the execution of privileged functions.

    Check if {{{ full_name }}} is configured to audit the execution of the "execve" system call using the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo grep execve /etc/audit/audit.rules</pre>

    The output should be the following:

    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S execve -C euid!=uid -F auid!=unset -k user_emulation</pre>
    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve  -C euid!=uid -F auid!=unset-k user_emulation</pre>

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to audit the execution of the "execve" system call.

    Add or update the following rules to "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules":

    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S execve -C euid!=uid -F auid!=unset -k user_emulation</pre>
    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -C euid!=uid -F auid!=unset -k user_emulation</pre>

    The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
