title: 'Configure immutable Audit login UIDs'

description: |-
    Configure kernel to prevent modification of login UIDs once they are set.
    Changing login UIDs while this configuration is enforced requires special capabilities which
    are not available to unprivileged users.
    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the
    <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules during daemon startup (the
    default), add the following line to a file with suffix <tt>.rules</tt> in the
    directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt> in order to make login UIDs
    immutable:
    <pre>--loginuid-immutable</pre>
    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>
    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following line to
    <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file in order to make login UIDs
    immutable:
    <pre>--loginuid-immutable</pre>

rationale: |-
    If modification of login UIDs is not prevented, they can be changed by unprivileged users and
    make auditing complicated or impossible.

ocil_clause: 'the system is not configured to make login UIDs immutable'

ocil: |-
    To determine if the system is configured to make login UIDs immutable, run
    one of the following commands.
    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the
    <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules during daemon startup (the
    default), run the following:
    <pre>sudo grep immutable /etc/audit/rules.d/*.rules</pre>
    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>
    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, run the following command:
    <pre>sudo grep immutable /etc/audit/audit.rules</pre>
    The following line should be returned:
    <pre>--loginuid-immutable</pre>
