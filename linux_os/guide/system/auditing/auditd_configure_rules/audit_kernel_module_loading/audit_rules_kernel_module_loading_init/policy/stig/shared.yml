    The addition of kernel modules can be used to alter the behavior of
    the kernel and potentially introduce malicious code into kernel space. It is important
    to have an audit trail of modules that have been introduced into the kernel.

    To determine if the system is configured to audit calls to the
     init_module  system call, run the following command:
     $ sudo grep "init_module" /etc/audit/audit.*
    If the system is configured to audit this activity, it will return a line.


    If no line is returned, then this is a finding.
