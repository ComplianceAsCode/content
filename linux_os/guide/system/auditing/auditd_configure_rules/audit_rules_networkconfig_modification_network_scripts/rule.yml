title: 'Record Events that Modify the System''s Network Environment'

description: |-
    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the
    <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules during daemon startup (the
    default), add the following line to a file with suffix <tt>.rules</tt> in the
    directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>:
    <pre>-w /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts -p wa -k audit_rules_networkconfig_modification_network_scripts</pre>
    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>
    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following line to
    <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file:
    <pre>-w /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts -p wa -k audit_rules_networkconfig_modification_network_scripts</pre>

rationale: |-
    The network environment should not be modified by anything other
    than administrator action. Any change to network parameters should be
    audited.

ocil_clause: 'the system is not configured to audit changes of the network configuration'

ocil: |-
    To determine if the system is configured to audit changes to its network configuration,
    run the following command:
    <pre>auditctl -l | grep -E '/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts'</pre>
    If the system is configured to watch for network configuration changes, a line should
    be returned and <tt>perm=wa</tt> should be indicated.
