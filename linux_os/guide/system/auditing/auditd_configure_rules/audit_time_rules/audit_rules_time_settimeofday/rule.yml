title: 'Record attempts to alter time through settimeofday'

description: |-
    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the
    <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules during daemon startup (the
    default), add the following line to a file with suffix <tt>.rules</tt> in the
    directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>:
    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S settimeofday -F key=audit_time_rules</pre>
    If the system is 64 bit then also add the following line:
    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S settimeofday -F key=audit_time_rules</pre>
    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>
    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following line to
    <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file:
    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S settimeofday -F key=audit_time_rules</pre>
    If the system is 64 bit then also add the following line:
    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S settimeofday -F key=audit_time_rules</pre>
    The -k option allows for the specification of a key in string form that can be
    used for better reporting capability through ausearch and aureport. Multiple
    system calls can be defined on the same line to save space if desired, but is
    not required. See an example of multiple combined syscalls:
    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S adjtimex,settimeofday -F key=audit_time_rules</pre>

rationale: |-
    Arbitrary changes to the system time can be used to obfuscate
    nefarious activities in log files, as well as to confuse network services that
    are highly dependent upon an accurate system time (such as sshd). All changes
    to the system time should be audited.
