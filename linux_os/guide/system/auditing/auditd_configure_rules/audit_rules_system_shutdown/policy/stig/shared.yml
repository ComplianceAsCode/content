srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must take appropriate action when a critical audit processing failure occurs.

vuldiscussion: |-
    It is critical for the appropriate personnel to be aware if a system
    is at risk of failing to process audit logs as required. Without this
    notification, the security personnel may be unaware of an impending failure of
    the audit capability, and system operation may be adversely affected.



    Audit processing failures include software/hardware errors, failures in the
    audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or
    exceeded.

checktext: |-
    Verify the audit service is configured to panic on a critical error with the following command:

    $ sudo grep "\-f" /etc/audit/audit.rules

    -f 2

    If the value for "-f" is not "2", and availability is not documented as an overriding concern, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to shutdown when auditing failures occur.

    Add the following line to the bottom of the /etc/audit/audit.rules file:
    -f 2
