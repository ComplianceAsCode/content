     Successful/unsuccessful uses of the unlinkat system call in {{{ full_name }}} must generate an audit record.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Auditing file deletions will create an audit trail for files that are removed
    from the system. The audit trail could aid in system troubleshooting, as well as, detecting
    malicious processes that attempt to delete log files to conceal their presence.

    To determine if the system is configured to audit calls to the
     unlinkat  system call, run the following command:
     $ sudo grep "unlinkat" /etc/audit/audit.*
    If the system is configured to audit this activity, it will return a line.


    If no line is returned, then this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the audit system to generate an audit event for any successful/unsuccessful use of the "unlinkat" system call by adding or updating the following rules in the "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules" file:
    -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S unlinkat -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k delete
    -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S unlinkat -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k delete

    It's allowed to group this system call within the same line as "rename", "unlink", "rmdir", "renameat", and "unlinkat".

    The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
