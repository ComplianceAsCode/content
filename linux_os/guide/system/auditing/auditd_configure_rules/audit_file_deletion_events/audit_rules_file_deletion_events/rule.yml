title: 'Ensure auditd Collects File Deletion Events by User'

description: |-
    At a minimum the audit system should collect file deletion events
    for all users and root. If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the
    <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules during daemon startup (the
    default), add the following line to a file with suffix <tt>.rules</tt> in the
    directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>, setting ARCH to either b32 or b64 as
    appropriate for your system:
    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=ARCH -S rmdir,unlink,unlinkat,rename,renameat -F auid&gt;={{{ auid }}} -F auid!=4294967295 -F key=delete</pre>
    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>
    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following line to
    <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file, setting ARCH to either b32 or b64 as
    appropriate for your system:
    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=ARCH -S rmdir,unlink,unlinkat,rename -S renameat -F auid&gt;={{{ auid }}} -F auid!=4294967295 -F key=delete</pre>

rationale: |-
    Auditing file deletions will create an audit trail for files that are removed
    from the system. The audit trail could aid in system troubleshooting, as well as, detecting
    malicious processes that attempt to delete log files to conceal their presence.

warnings:
    - general: |-
        This rule checks for multiple syscalls related to file deletion;
        it was written with DISA STIG in mind. Other policies should use a
        separate rule for each syscall that needs to be checked. For example:
        <ul>
        <li><tt>audit_rules_file_deletion_events_rmdir</tt></li>
        <li><tt>audit_rules_file_deletion_events_unlink</tt></li>
        <li><tt>audit_rules_file_deletion_events_unlinkat</tt></li>
        </ul>
