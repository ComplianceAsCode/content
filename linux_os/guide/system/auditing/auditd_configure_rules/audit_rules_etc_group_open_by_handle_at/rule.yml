title: 'Record Events that Modify User/Group Information via open_by_handle_at syscall - /etc/group'

description: |-
    The audit system should collect write events to /etc/group file for all group and root.
    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured
    to use the <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules during daemon
    startup (the default), add the following lines to a file with suffix
    <tt>.rules</tt> in the directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>:
    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S open_by_handle_at -F a2&amp;03 -F path=/etc/group -F auid>={{{ auid }}} -F auid!=unset -F key=group-modify</pre>
    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>
    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following lines to
    <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file:
    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S open_by_handle_at -F a2&amp;03 -F path=/etc/group -F auid>={{{ auid }}} -F auid!=unset -F key=group-modify</pre>

rationale: |-
    Creation of groups through direct edition of /etc/group could be an indicator of malicious activity on a system.
    Auditing these events could serve as evidence of potential system compromise.

warnings:
    - general: |-
        Note that these rules can be configured in a
        number of ways while still achieving the desired effect. Here the system calls
        have been placed independent of other system calls. Grouping system calls related
        to the same event is more efficient. See the following example:
        <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S open,openat,open_by_handle_at -F a2&amp;03 -F path=/etc/group -F auid>={{{ auid }}} -F auid!=unset -F key=group-modify</pre>
