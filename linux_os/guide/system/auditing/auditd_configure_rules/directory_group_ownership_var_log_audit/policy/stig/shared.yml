    {{{ full_name }}} audit logs must be group-owned by root or by a restricted logging group to prevent unauthorized read access.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Unauthorized disclosure of audit records can reveal system and configuration data to attackers, thus compromising its confidentiality.

checktext: |-
    Verify the audit logs are group-owned by "root" or a restricted logging group.

    First determine if a group other than "root" has been assigned to the audit logs with the following command:

    $sudo grep log_group /etc/audit/auditd.conf


    Then determine where the audit logs are stored with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -iw log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf

    log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log

    Then using the location of the audit log file, determine if the audit log is group-owned by "root" using the following command:

    $ sudo stat -c "%G %n" /var/log/audit/audit.log

    root /var/log/audit/audit.log

    If the audit log is not group-owned by "root" or the configured alternative logging group, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Change the group of the directory of "/var/log/audit" to be owned by a correct group.

    Identify the group that is configured to own audit log:

    $ sudo grep -P '^[ ]*log_group[ ]+=.*$' /etc/audit/auditd.conf

    Change the ownership to that group:
    $ sudo chgrp ${GROUP} /var/log/audit
