     Successful/unsuccessful uses of the openat system call in {{{ full_name }}} must generate an audit record.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Unsuccessful attempts to access files could be an indicator of malicious activity on a system. Auditing
    these events could serve as evidence of potential system compromise.

checktext: |-
    To determine if the system is configured to audit calls to the
     openat  system call, run the following command:
     $ sudo grep "openat" /etc/audit/audit.*
    If the system is configured to audit this activity, it will return a line.


    If no line is returned, then this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the audit system to generate an audit event for any successful/unsuccessful use of the "openat" system call by adding or updating the following rules in the "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules" file:
    -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S openat -F exit=-EPERM -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k perm_access
    -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S openat -F exit=-EPERM -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k perm_access

    -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S openat -F exit=-EACCES -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k perm_access
    -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S openat -F exit=-EACCES -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k perm_access

    It's allowed to group this system call within the same line as "creat", "ftruncate", "truncate", "open", "openat" and "open_by_handle_at".

    The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
