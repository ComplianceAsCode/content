title: 'Record Successful Permission Changes to Files - fchmod'

description: |-
    At a minimum, the audit system should collect file permission changes
    for all users and root. If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured
    to use the <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules during daemon
    startup (the default), add the following lines to a file with suffix
    <tt>.rules</tt> in the directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>:

    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S fchmod -F success=1 -F auid&gt;={{{ auid }}} -F auid!=unset -F key=successful-perm-change</pre>

    If the system is 64 bit then also add the following lines:
    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S fchmod -F success=1 -F auid&gt;={{{ auid }}} -F auid!=unset -F key=successful-perm-change</pre>

    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>
    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following lines to
    <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file:
    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S fchmod -F success=1 -F auid&gt;={{{ auid }}} -F auid!=unset -F key=successful-perm-change</pre>

    If the system is 64 bit then also add the following lines:
    <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S fchmod -F success=1 -F auid&gt;={{{ auid }}} -F auid!=unset -F key=successful-perm-change</pre>

rationale: |-
    File permission changes could be an indicator of malicious activity on a system. Auditing
    these events could serve as evidence of potential system compromise.

        Note that these rules can be configured in a
        number of ways while still achieving the desired effect. Here the system calls
        have been placed independent of other system calls. Grouping these system
        calls with others as identifying earlier in this guide is more efficient.
