title: 'Remove Default Configuration to Disable Syscall Auditing'

description: |-
    By default, {{{ full_name }}} ships an audit rule to disable syscall auditing for performance reasons.

    To make sure that syscall auditing works, this line must be removed from <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules</tt> and <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt>:

    <pre>-a task,never</pre>

rationale: |-
    Audit rules for syscalls do not take effect unless this line is removed.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: 'syscall auditing is still disabled'

ocil: |-
    To check for the offending line, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep task,never /etc/audit/{rules.d,.}/audit.rules</pre>
    There must not be any output, or else these lines must be removed from the matching files.
