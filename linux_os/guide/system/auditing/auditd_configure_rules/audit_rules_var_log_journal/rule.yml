title: 'Ensure auditd Collects records for events that affect "/var/log/journal"'

description: |-
    Auditing the systemd journal files provides logging that can be used for
    forensic purposes. Verify the system generates audit records for all events
    that affect "/var/log/journal" by using the following command:

    <pre>
    $ sudo auditctl -l | grep journal
    -w /var/log/journal/ -p wa -k systemd_journal
    </pre>

    If the command does not return a line that matches the example or the line
    is commented out, this is a finding.

    Note: The "-k" value is arbitrary and can be different from the example
    output above.

rationale: |-
    Once an attacker establishes access to a system, the attacker often attempts
    to create a persistent method of reestablishing access. One way to accomplish
    this is for the attacker to modify system level binaries and their operation.
    Auditing the systemd journal files provides logging that can be used for
    forensic purposes.
