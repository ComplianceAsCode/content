    {{{ full_name }}} audit log files must be group-owned by root or a restricted logging group to prevent unauthorized access.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Unauthorized disclosure of audit records can reveal system and configuration data to
    attackers, thus compromising its confidentiality.

checktext: |-
    Check group owners of the system audit logs.

    First, determine where the audit log file is located.

     $ sudo grep -iw ^log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf
     log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log

    The log_file option specifies the audit log file path.
    If the log_file option isn't defined, check all files within /var/log/audit directory.

    Then, determine the audit log group by running the following command:
     $ sudo grep -P '^[ ]*log_group[ ]+=.*$' /etc/audit/auditd.conf

    Then, check that the audit log file is owned by the correct group.
    Run the following command to display the owner of the audit log file:

     $ sudo stat -c "%n %G" "log_file"

    The audit log file must be owned by the log_group or by root if the log_group is not specified.

    If audit log files are owned by incorrect group, then this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Change the group of the audit log file to be owned by a correct group.

    Identify where the audit log file is located:

    $ sudo grep -iw ^log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf

    Identify the group that is configured to own audit log:

    $ sudo grep -P '^[ ]*log_group[ ]+=.*$' /etc/audit/auditd.conf

    Change the ownership to that group:

    $ sudo chgrp ${log_group} ${log_file}
