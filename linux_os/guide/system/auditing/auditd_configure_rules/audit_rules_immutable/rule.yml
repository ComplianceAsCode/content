title: 'Make the auditd Configuration Immutable'

description: |-
    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the
    <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules during daemon startup (the
    default), add the following line to a file with suffix <tt>.rules</tt> in the
    directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt> in order to make the auditd configuration
    immutable:
    <pre>-e 2</pre>
    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>
    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following line to
    <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file in order to make the auditd configuration
    immutable:
    <pre>-e 2</pre>
    With this setting, a reboot will be required to change any audit rules.

rationale: |-
    Making the audit configuration immutable prevents accidental as
    well as malicious modification of the audit rules, although it may be
    problematic if legitimate changes are needed during system
    operation
