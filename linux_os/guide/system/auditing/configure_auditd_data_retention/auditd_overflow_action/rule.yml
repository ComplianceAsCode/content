description: |-
    The audit system should have an action setup in the event the internal event queue becomes full.
    To setup an overflow action edit <tt>/etc/audit/auditd.conf</tt>. Set <tt>overflow_action</tt>
    to one of the following values: <tt>syslog</tt>, <tt>single</tt>, <tt>halt</tt>.


rationale: |-
    The audit system should have an action setup in the event the internal event queue becomes full
    so that no data is lost.

ocil: |-
    Verify the audit system is configured to take an appropriate action when the internal event queue is full:
    <pre>$ sudo grep -i overflow_action /etc/audit/auditd.conf</pre>

    The output should contain be like <tt>overflow_action = syslog</tt>

    If the value of the "overflow_action" option is not set to <tt>syslog</tt>, 
    <tt>single</tt>, <tt>halt</tt> or the line is commented out, ask the System Administrator
    to indicate how the audit logs are off-loaded to a different system or media.
