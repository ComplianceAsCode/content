title: 'Configure a Sufficiently Large Partition for Audit Logs'

description: |-
    The {{{ full_name }}} operating system must allocate audit record storage
    capacity to store at least one weeks worth of audit records when audit
    records are not immediately sent to a central audit record storage
    facility.

    The partition size needed to capture a week's worth of audit records is
    based on the activity level of the system and the total storage capacity
    available. In normal circumstances, 10.0 GB of storage space for audit
    records will be sufficient.

    Determine which partition the audit records are being written to with the
    following command:

    <pre>$ sudo grep log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf
    log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log</pre>

    Check the size of the partition that audit records are written to with the
    following command:

    <pre>$ sudo df -h /var/log/audit/
    /dev/sda2 24G 10.4G 13.6G 43% /var/log/audit</pre>

rationale: |-
    Information stored in one location is vulnerable to accidental or incidental
    deletion or alteration. Off-loading is a common process in information
    systems with limited audit storage capacity.

ocil_clause: 'audispd is not sending logs to a remote system and the local partition has inadequate space'

ocil: |-
    To verify whether audispd plugin off-loads audit records onto a different
    system or media from the system being audited, run the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo grep -i remote_server {{{ audisp_conf_path }}}/audisp-remote.conf</pre>

    The output should return something similar to where <i>REMOTE_SYSTEM</i>
    is an IP address or hostname:
    <pre>remote_server = <i>REMOTE_SYSTEM</i></pre>

    Determine which partition the audit records are being written to with the
    following command:

    <pre>$ sudo grep log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf
    log_file = /var/log/audit/audit.log</pre>

    Check the size of the partition that audit records are written to with the
    following command and verify whether it is sufficiently large:

    <pre>$ sudo df -h /var/log/audit/
    /dev/sda2 24G 10.4G 13.6G 43% /var/log/audit</pre>

fixtext: |-
    Allocate enough storage capacity for at least one week of audit records when audit records are not immediately sent to a central audit record storage facility.

    If audit records are stored on a partition made specifically for audit records, resize the partition with sufficient space to contain one week of audit records.

    If audit records are not stored on a partition made specifically for audit records, a new partition with sufficient space will need be to be created.
