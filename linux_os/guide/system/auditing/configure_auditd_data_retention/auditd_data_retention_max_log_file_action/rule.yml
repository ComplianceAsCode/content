title: 'Configure auditd max_log_file_action Upon Reaching Maximum Log Size'

description: |-
    The default action to take when the logs reach their maximum size
    is to rotate the log files, discarding the oldest one. To configure the action taken
    by <tt>auditd</tt>, add or correct the line in <tt>/etc/audit/auditd.conf</tt>:
    <pre>max_log_file_action = <i>ACTION</i></pre>
    Possible values for <i>ACTION</i> are described in the <tt>auditd.conf</tt> man
    page. These include:
    <ul>
    <li><tt>syslog</tt></li>
    <li><tt>suspend</tt></li>
    <li><tt>rotate</tt></li>
    <li><tt>keep_logs</tt></li>
    </ul>
    Set the <tt><i>ACTION</i></tt> to <tt>rotate</tt> to ensure log rotation
    occurs. This is the default. The setting is case-insensitive.

rationale: |-
    Automatically rotating logs (by setting this to <tt>rotate</tt>)
    minimizes the chances of the system unexpectedly running out of disk space by
    being overwhelmed with log data. However, for systems that must never discard
    log data, or which use external processes to transfer it and reclaim space,
    <tt>keep_logs</tt> can be employed.

    Inspect <tt>/etc/audit/auditd.conf</tt> and locate the following line to
    determine if the system is configured to rotate logs when they reach their
    maximum size:
    <tt>$ sudo grep max_log_file_action /etc/audit/auditd.conf</tt>
