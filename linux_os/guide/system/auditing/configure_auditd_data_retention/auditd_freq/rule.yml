title: 'Set number of records to cause an explicit flush to audit logs'

description: |-
    To configure Audit daemon to issue an explicit flush to disk command
    after writing 50 records, set <tt>freq</tt> to <tt>50</tt>
    in <tt>/etc/audit/auditd.conf</tt>.

rationale: |-
    If option <tt>freq</tt> isn't set to <tt>50</tt>, the flush to disk
    may happen after higher number of records, increasing the danger
    of audit loss.

ocil_clause: freq isn't set to 50

ocil: |-
    To verify that Audit Daemon is configured to flush to disk after
    every 50 records, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep freq /etc/audit/auditd.conf</pre>
    The output should return the following:
    <pre>freq = 50</pre>

    name: auditd_lineinfile

        missing_parameter_pass: 'false'
        parameter: freq
        rule_id: auditd_freq
        value: '50'
