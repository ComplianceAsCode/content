    {{{ full_name }}} must periodically flush audit records to disk to ensure that audit records are not lost.

vuldiscussion: |-
    If option "freq" isn't set to a value that requires audit records being written to disk after a threshold number is reached then audit records may be lost.

checktext: |-
    Verify that audit system is configured to flush to disk after every 50 records with the following command:

    $ sudo grep freq /etc/audit/auditd.conf

    freq = 100

    If "freq" isn't set to a value of "100" or greater, the value is missing, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to flush audit to disk by adding or updating the following rule in "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules":

    freq = 100

    The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
