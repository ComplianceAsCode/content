title: 'Write Audit Logs to the Disk'

description: |-
    To configure Audit daemon to write Audit logs to the disk, set
    <tt>write_logs</tt> to <tt>yes</tt> in <tt>/etc/audit/auditd.conf</tt>.
    This is the default setting.

rationale: |-
    If <tt>write_logs</tt> isn't set to <tt>yes</tt>, the Audit logs will
    not be written to the disk.
