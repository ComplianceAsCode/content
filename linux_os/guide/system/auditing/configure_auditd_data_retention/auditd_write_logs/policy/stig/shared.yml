    {{{ full_name }}} must write audit records to disk.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Audit data should be synchronously written to disk to ensure
    log integrity. This setting assures that all audit event data is written disk.

checktext: |-
    Verify that the audit system is configured to write logs to the disk with the following command:

    $ sudo grep write_logs /etc/audit/auditd.conf

    write_logs = yes

    If "write_logs" does not have a value of "yes", the line is commented out, or the line is missing, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the audit system to write log files to the disk.

    Edit the /etc/audit/auditd.conf file and add or update the "write_logs" option to "yes":

    write_logs = yes

    The audit daemon must be restarted for changes to take effect.
