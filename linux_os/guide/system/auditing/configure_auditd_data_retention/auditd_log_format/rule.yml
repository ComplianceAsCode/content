title: 'Resolve information before writing to audit logs'

description: |-
    To configure Audit daemon to resolve all uid, gid, syscall,
    architecture, and socket address information before writing the
    events to disk, set <tt>log_format</tt> to <tt>ENRICHED</tt>
    in <tt>/etc/audit/auditd.conf</tt>.

rationale: |-
    If option <tt>log_format</tt> isn't set to <tt>ENRICHED</tt>, the
    audit records will be stored in a format exactly as the kernel sends them.

ocil_clause: log_format isn't set to ENRICHED

ocil: |-
    To verify that Audit Daemon is configured to resolve all uid, gid, syscall,
    architecture, and socket address information before writing the event to disk,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep log_format /etc/audit/auditd.conf</pre>
    The output should return the following:
    <pre>log_format = ENRICHED</pre>

template:
    name: auditd_lineinfile
    vars:
        missing_parameter_pass: 'false'
        parameter: log_format
        rule_id: auditd_log_format
        value: ENRICHED
