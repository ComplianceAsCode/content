title: 'Offload audit Logs to External Media'

description: |-
    The operating system must have a crontab script running weekly to
    offload audit events of standalone systems.

rationale: |-
    Information stored in one location is vulnerable to accidental or
    incidental deletion or alteration.
    Offloading is a common process in information systems with limited
    audit storage capacity.

severity: medium

warnings:
    - general: |-
        Due to different needs and possibilities, automated remediation is not
        available for this configuration check.

ocil_clause: 'Cron job has not been configured to offload audit logs to external media'

ocil: |-
    Verify there is a script that offloads audit data and that script runs
    weekly.
    Check if there is a script in the "/etc/cron.weekly" directory that
    offloads audit data:
    <pre># sudo ls /etc/cron.weekly
    audit-offload</pre>
    Check if the script inside the file does offloading of audit logs to
    external media.
    If the script file does not exist or does not offload audit logs, this
    is a finding.
