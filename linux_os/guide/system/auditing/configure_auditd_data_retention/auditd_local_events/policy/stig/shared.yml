srg_requirement: |-
    The {{{ full_name }}} audit system must audit local events.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Without establishing what type of events occurred, the source of events, where events occurred, and the outcome of events, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events leading up to an outage or attack.

    If option "local_events" isn't set to "yes" only events from network will be aggregated.

checktext: |-
    Verify that the {{{ full_name }}} audit system is configured to audit local events with the following command:

    $ sudo grep local_events /etc/audit/auditd.conf

    local_events = yes

    If "local_events" isn't set to "yes", if the command does not return a line, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to generate audit records for local events by adding or updating the following line in "/etc/audit/auditd.conf":

    local_events = yes


    The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
