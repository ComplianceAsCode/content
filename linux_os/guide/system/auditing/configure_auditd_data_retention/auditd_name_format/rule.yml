title: 'Set hostname as computer node name in audit logs'

description: |-
    To configure Audit daemon to use value returned by gethostname
    syscall as computer node name in the audit events,
    set <tt>name_format</tt> to <tt>hostname</tt>
    in <tt>/etc/audit/auditd.conf</tt>.

rationale: |-
    If option <tt>name_format</tt> is left at its default value of
    <tt>none</tt>, audit events from different computers may be hard
    to distinguish.

ocil: |-
    To verify that Audit Daemon is configured to record the hostname
    in audit events, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep name_format /etc/audit/auditd.conf</pre>
    The output should return the following:
    <pre>name_format = hostname</pre>

template:
    name: auditd_lineinfile

        missing_parameter_pass: 'false'
        parameter: name_format
        rule_id: auditd_name_format
        value: hostname
