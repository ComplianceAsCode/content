title: 'Configure auditd admin_space_left Action on Low Disk Space'

description: |-
    The <tt>auditd</tt> service can be configured to take an action
    when disk space is running low but prior to running out of space completely.
    Edit the file <tt>/etc/audit/auditd.conf</tt>. Add or modify the following line,
    substituting <i>ACTION</i> appropriately:
    <pre>admin_space_left_action = <i>ACTION</i></pre>
    Set this value to <tt>single</tt> to cause the system to switch to single user
    mode for corrective action. Acceptable values also include <tt>suspend</tt> and
    <tt>halt</tt>. For certain systems, the need for availability
    outweighs the need to log all actions, and a different setting should be
    determined. Details regarding all possible values for <i>ACTION</i> are described in the
    <tt>auditd.conf</tt> man page.

rationale: |-
    Administrators should be made aware of an inability to record
    audit records. If a separate partition or logical volume of adequate size
    is used, running low on space for audit records should never occur.
