title: 'Configure auditd admin_space_left Action on Low Disk Space'

description: |-
    The <tt>auditd</tt> service can be configured to take an action
    when disk space is running low but prior to running out of space completely.
    Edit the file <tt>/etc/audit/auditd.conf</tt>. Add or modify the following line,
    substituting <i>ACTION</i> appropriately:
    <pre>admin_space_left_action = <i>ACTION</i></pre>
    Set this value to <tt>single</tt> to cause the system to switch to single user
    mode for corrective action. Acceptable values also include <tt>suspend</tt> and
    <tt>halt</tt>. For certain systems, the need for availability
    outweighs the need to log all actions, and a different setting should be
    determined. Details regarding all possible values for <i>ACTION</i> are described in the
    <tt>auditd.conf</tt> man page.

rationale: |-
    Administrators should be made aware of an inability to record
    audit records. If a separate partition or logical volume of adequate size
    is used, running low on space for audit records should never occur.

ocil_clause: 'there is no evidence that real-time alerts are configured on the system'

ocil: |-
    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} is configured to take action in the event of allocated audit record storage volume reaches 95 percent of the repository maximum audit record storage capacity with the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo grep admin_space_left_action /etc/audit/auditd.conf

    admin_space_left_action = single</pre>

    If the value of the "admin_space_left_action" is not set to "single", or if the line is commented out, ask the System Administrator to indicate how the system is providing real-time alerts to the SA and ISSO.

fixtext: |-
    Configure "auditd" service  to take action in the event of allocated audit record storage volume reaches 95 percent of the repository maximum audit record storage capacity.

    Edit the following line in "/etc/audit/auditd.conf" to ensure that the system is forced into single user mode in the event the audit record storage volume is about to reach maximum capacity:

    <pre>admin_space_left_action = single</pre>

    The audit daemon must be restarted for changes to take effect.

srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must take action when allocated audit record storage volume reaches 95 percent of the repository maximum audit record storage capacity.
    {{{ full_name }}} must immediately notify the System Administrator (SA) and Information System Security Officer (ISSO) (at a minimum) via email when the threshold for the repository maximum audit record storage capacity is reached.

vuldiscussion: |-
    If security personnel are not notified immediately when storage volume reaches 90% utilization, they are unable to plan for audit record storage capacity expansion.
