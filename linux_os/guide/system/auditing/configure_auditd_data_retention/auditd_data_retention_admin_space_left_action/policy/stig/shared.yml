    {{{ full_name }}} must take action when allocated audit record storage volume reaches 95 percent of the repository maximum audit record storage capacity.

vuldiscussion: |-
    If action is not taken when storage volume reaches 95% utilization the auditing system may fail when the storage volume reaches capacity.

    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} is configured to take action in the event of allocated audit record storage volume reaches 95 percent of the repository maximum audit record storage capacity with the following command:

    $ sudo grep admin_space_left_action /etc/audit/auditd.conf

    admin_space_left_action = single

    If the value of the "admin_space_left_action" is not set to "single", or if the line is commented out, ask the System Administrator to indicate how the system is providing real-time alerts to the SA and ISSO.

    If there is no evidence that real-time alerts are configured on the system, this is a finding.

    Configure "auditd" service  to take action in the event of allocated audit record storage volume reaches 95 percent of the repository maximum audit record storage capacity.

    Edit the following line in "/etc/audit/auditd.conf" to ensure that the system is forced into single user mode in the event the audit record storage volume is about to reach maximum capacity:

    admin_space_left_action = single

    The audit daemon must be restarted for changes to take effect.
