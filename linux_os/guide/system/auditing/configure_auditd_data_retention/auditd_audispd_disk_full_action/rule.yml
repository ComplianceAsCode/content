title: 'Configure audispd''s Plugin disk_full_action When Disk Is Full'

description: |-
    Configure the action the operating system takes if the disk the audit records
    are written to becomes full. Edit the file <tt>/etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf</tt>.
    Add or modify the following line, substituting <i>ACTION</i> appropriately:
    <pre>disk_full_action = <i>ACTION</i></pre>
    Set this value to <tt>single</tt> to cause the system to switch to single user
    mode for corrective action. Acceptable values also include <tt>syslog</tt> and
    <tt>halt</tt>. For certain systems, the need for availability
    outweighs the need to log all actions, and a different setting should be
    determined.

rationale: |-
    Taking appropriate action in case of a filled audit storage volume will
    minimize the possibility of losing audit records.

ocil_clause: 'the system is not configured to switch to single user mode for corrective action'

ocil: |-
    Inspect <tt>/etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf</tt> and locate the following line to
    determine if the system is configured to either send to syslog, switch to single user mode,
    or halt when the disk is full:
    <pre>grep -i disk_full_action /etc/audisp/audisp-remote.conf</pre>
    The output should return something similar to:
    <pre>disk_full_action = single</pre>
    Acceptable values also include <tt>syslog</tt> and
    <tt>halt</tt>.
