description: |-
    Ensure that successful attempts to change an ownership of files or directories are audited.

    The following rules configure audit as described above:
    <pre>{{{ file_contents_audit_owner_change_success|indent }}}    </pre>

    The <tt>Audit</tt> package provides pre-configured  rules in <tt>/usr/share/audit/sample-rules</tt>. The above content can be found in <tt>/usr/share/audit/sample-rules/30-ospp-v42-6-owner-change-success.rules</tt>.
    To deploy this configuration, it is recommended to copy it over to the <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d/</tt> directory:
    <pre>
    cp /usr/share/audit/sample-rules/30-ospp-v42-6-owner-change-success.rules /etc/audit/rules.d/
    </pre>
    
    The file has the following SHA-256 checksum:
    <pre>7eb41a6aaf6737c2571b6424fae7fa53af4b41a9115b6c5732a5778ccd9900ad</pre>
    
    Load new Audit rules into kernel by running:
    <pre>augenrules --load</pre>
    
    Note: This rule utilizes a file provided by <tt>Audit</tt> package to comply with OSPP 4.2.1. You may reuse this rule in different profiles. If you decide to do so, it is recommended that you inspect contents of the file closely and make sure that they are alligned with your needs.


rationale: |-
    Auditing of successful ownership changes of files or directories helps in monitoring or investingating of activities performed on the system.

    To verify that the <tt>Audit</tt> is correctly configured according to recommended rules, check the content of the file with the following command:
    <pre>cat /etc/audit/rules.d/30-ospp-v42-6-owner-change-success.rules</pre>
    The output has to be exactly as follows:
    <pre>{{{ file_contents_audit_owner_change_success|indent }}}    </pre>

template:
    name: audit_file_contents
    vars:
        filepath: /etc/audit/rules.d/30-ospp-v42-6-owner-change-success.rules
