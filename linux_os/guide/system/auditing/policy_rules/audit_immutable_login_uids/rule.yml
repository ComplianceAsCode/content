title: 'Configure immutable Audit login UIDs'

{{% set file_contents_audit_immutable_login =
"## Make the loginuid immutable. This prevents tampering with the auid.
--loginuid-immutable

" %}}

description: |-
    Configure kernel to prevent modification of login UIDs once they are set. Changing login UUIDs while this configuration is enforced requires special capabilities which are not available to unprivileged users.   

    The following rules configure audit as described above:
    <pre>{{{ file_contents_audit_immutable_login|indent }}}    </pre>

    The <tt>Audit</tt> provides pre-configured  rules in <tt>/usr/share/audit/sample-rules</tt>. The above content can be found in <tt>/usr/share/audit/sample-rules/11-loginuid.rules</tt>.
    To deploy this configuration, it is recommended to copy it over to the <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d/</tt> directory:
    <pre>
    cp /usr/share/audit/sample-rules/11-loginuid.rules /etc/audit/rules.d/
    </pre>
    
    Load new Audit rules into kernel by running:
    <pre>augenrules --load</pre>

rationale: |-
    If modification of login UIDs is not prevented, they can be changed by unprivileged users and make auditing complicated or impossible.

    To verify that the <tt>Audit</tt> is correctly configured according to recommended rules, check the content of the file with the following command:
    <pre>cat /etc/audit/rules.d/11-loginuid.rules</pre>
    The output has to be exactly as follows:
    <pre>{{{ file_contents_audit_immutable_login|indent }}}    </pre>
