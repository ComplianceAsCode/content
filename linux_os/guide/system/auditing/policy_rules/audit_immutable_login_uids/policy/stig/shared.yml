    {{{ full_name }}} audit system must protect logon UIDs from unauthorized change.

vuldiscussion: |-
    If modification of login UIDs is not prevented, they can be changed by unprivileged users and make auditing complicated or impossible.

checktext: |-
    Verify the audit system prevents unauthorized changes to logon UIDs with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -i immutable /etc/audit/audit.rules

    --loginuid-immutable

    If the "--loginuid-immutable" option is not returned in the "/etc/audit/audit.rules", or the line is commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} auditing to prevent modification of login UIDs once they are set by adding the following line to /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules:


    --loginuid-immutable


    The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect.
