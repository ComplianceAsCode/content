description: |-
    Ensure that unsuccessful attempts to access a file are audited.

    The following rules configure audit as described above:
    <pre>{{{ file_contents_audit_access_failed|indent }}}    </pre>    
    
    Load new Audit rules into kernel by running:
    <pre>augenrules --load</pre>
    
    Note: This rule utilizes a file provided by <tt>Audit</tt> package to comply with OSPP 4.2.1. You may reuse this rule in different profiles. If you decide to do so, it is recommended that you inspect contents of the file closely and make sure that they are alligned with your needs.


rationale: |-
    Unsuccessful attempts to access a file might be signs of malicious activity happening within the system. Auditing of such activities helps in their monitoring and investigation.

    To verify that the <tt>Audit</tt> is correctly configured according to recommended rules, check the content of the file with the following command:
    <pre>cat /etc/audit/rules.d/30-ospp-v42-3-access-failed.rules</pre>
    The output has to be exactly as follows:
    <pre>{{{ file_contents_audit_access_failed|indent }}}    </pre>

template:
    name: audit_file_contents
