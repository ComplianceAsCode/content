title: 'Extend Audit Backlog Limit for the Audit Daemon'

description: |-
    To improve the kernel capacity to queue all log events, even those which occurred
    prior to the audit daemon, add the argument <tt>audit_backlog_limit=8192</tt> to all
    BLS (Boot Loader Specification) entries ('options' line) for the Linux
    operating system in <tt>/boot/loader/entries/*.conf</tt>.

rationale: |-
    audit_backlog_limit sets the queue length for audit events awaiting transfer
    to the audit daemon. Until the audit daemon is up and running, all log messages
    are stored in this queue.  If the queue is overrun during boot process, the action
    defined by audit failure flag is taken.

ocil: |-
    Inspect the form of all the BLS (Boot Loader Specification) entries
    ('options' line) in <tt>/boot/loader/entries/*.conf</tt>. If they include
    <tt>audit=1</tt>, then auditing is enabled at boot time.
    <br /><br />
    To ensure <tt>audit_backlog_limit=8192</tt> is configured on the installed kernel, add
    the kernel argument via a <pre>MachineConfig</pre> object to the appropriate
    pools.
