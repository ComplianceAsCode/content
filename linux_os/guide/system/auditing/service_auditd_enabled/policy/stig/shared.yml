    The {{{ full_name }}} audit service must be enabled.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Without establishing what type of events occurred, it would be difficult
    to establish, correlate, and investigate the events leading up to an outage or attack.
    Ensuring the "auditd" service is active ensures audit records
    generated by the kernel are appropriately recorded.



    Additionally, a properly configured audit subsystem ensures that actions of
    individual system users can be uniquely traced to those users so they
    can be held accountable for their actions.

    Verify the audit service is configured to produce audit records with the following command:

    $ systemctl status auditd.service

    auditd.service - Security Auditing Service
    Loaded:loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/auditd.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
    Active: active (running) since Tues 2022-05-24 12:56:56 EST; 4 weeks 0 days ago

    If the audit service is not "active" and "running", this is a finding.

    To enable the auditd service run the following command:

    $ sudo systemctl enable --now auditd
