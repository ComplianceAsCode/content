title: 'Set Boot Loader Password'

description: |-
    During the boot process, the boot loader is
    responsible for starting the execution of the kernel and passing
    options to it. The boot loader allows for the selection of
    different kernels - possibly on different partitions or media.
    The default Red Hat Enterprise Linux boot loader for x86 systems is called GRUB.
    Options it can pass to the kernel include <i>single-user mode</i>, which
    provides root access without any authentication, and the ability to
    disable SELinux. To prevent local users from modifying the boot
    parameters and endangering security, protect the boot loader configuration
    with a password and ensure its configuration file's permissions
    are set properly.
