title: 'Enable Auditing to Start Prior to the Audit Daemon in zIPL'

description: |-
    To ensure all processes can be audited, even those which start prior to the audit daemon,
    check that all boot entries in <tt>/boot/loader/entries/*.conf</tt> have <tt>audit=1</tt>
    included in its options.<br />
    Make sure <tt>/etc/zipl.conf</tt> doesn't contain <tt>image = </tt> setting,
    as {{{ full_name }}} adheres to Boot Loader Specification (BLS).<br />
    And run <tt>zipl</tt> command so that <tt>/boot/bootmap</tt> is updated.<br /><br />

    To ensure that new kernels and boot entries continue to enable audit,
    add <tt>audit=1</tt> to <tt>/etc/kernel/cmdline</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Each process on the system carries an "auditable" flag which indicates whether
    its activities can be audited. Although <tt>auditd</tt> takes care of enabling
    this for all processes which launch after it does, adding the kernel argument
    ensures it is set for every process during boot.

ocil_clause: 'auditing is not enabled at boot time'

ocil: |-
  To check that audit is enabled at boot time, check all boot entries with following command:
  <pre>sudo grep -L "^options\s+.*\baudit=1\b" /boot/loader/entries/*.conf</pre>
  No line should be returned, each line returned is a boot entry that doesn't enable audit.

  Check that no image file is specified in <tt>/etc/zipl.conf</tt>:
  <pre>grep -R "^image\s*=" /etc/zipl.conf</pre>
  No line should be returned, if a line is returned zipl may load a different kernel than intended.

  And make sure that <tt>/boot/bootmap</tt> is newer than <tt>/boot/loader/entries/*.conf</tt>
  and <tt>/etc/zipl.conf</tt>:
  <pre>find /boot/loader/entries/*.conf /etc/zipl.conf -newer /boot/bootmap</pre>
  No line should be returned, if a line is returned <tt>/boot/bootmap</tt> needs to be regenerated.
