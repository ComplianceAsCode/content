title: 'Configure kernel to zero out memory before allocation in zIPL'

description: |-
    To ensure that the kernel is configured to zero out memory before
    allocation, check that all boot entries in
    <tt>/boot/loader/entries/*.conf</tt> have <tt>init_on_alloc=1</tt>
    included in its options.<br />

    To ensure that new kernels and boot entries continue to zero out memory
    before allocation, add <tt>init_on_alloc=1</tt> to <tt>/etc/kernel/cmdline</tt>.

rationale: |-
    When the kernel configuration option <tt>init_on_alloc</tt> is enabled,
    all page allocator and slab allocator memory will be zeroed when allocated,
    eliminating many kinds of "uninitialized heap memory" flaws, effectively
    preventing data leaks.

ocil_clause: 'the kernel is not configured to zero out memory before allocation'

ocil: |-
  To check that the kernel is configured to zero out memory before allocation
  time, check all boot entries with following command:
  <pre>sudo grep -L"^options\s+.*\binit_on_alloc=1\b" /boot/loader/entries/*.conf</pre>
  No line should be returned, each line returned is a boot entry that doesn't enable audit.
