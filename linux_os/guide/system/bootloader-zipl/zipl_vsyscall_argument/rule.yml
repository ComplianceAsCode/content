title: 'Disable vsyscalls in zIPL'

description: |-
    To disable use of virtual syscalls,
    check that all boot entries in <tt>/boot/loader/entries/*.conf</tt> have <tt>vsyscall=none</tt>
    included in its options.<br />
    To ensure that new kernels and boot entries continue to disable virtual syscalls,
    add <tt>vsyscall=none</tt> to <tt>/etc/kernel/cmdline</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Virtual Syscalls provide an opportunity of attack for a user who has control
    of the return instruction pointer.

ocil: |-
  To check that virtual syscalls are disabled at boot time, check all boot entries with following command:
  <pre>sudo grep -L "^options\s+.*\bvsyscall=none\b" /boot/loader/entries/*.conf</pre>
  No line should be returned, each line returned is a boot entry that doesn't disable virtual syscalls.
