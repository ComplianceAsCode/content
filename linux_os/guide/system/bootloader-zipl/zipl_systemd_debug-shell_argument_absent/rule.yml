title: 'Ensure debug-shell service is not enabled in zIPL'

description: |-
    systemd's <tt>debug-shell</tt> service is intended to
    diagnose systemd related boot issues with various <tt>systemctl</tt>
    commands. Once enabled and following a system reboot, the root shell
    will be available on <tt>tty9</tt> which is access by pressing
    <tt>CTRL-ALT-F9</tt>. The <tt>debug-shell</tt> service should only be used
    for systemd related issues and should otherwise be disabled.
    <br /><br />
    By default, the <tt>debug-shell</tt> systemd service is already disabled.

    Ensure the debug-shell is not enabled by the <tt>systemd.debug-shel=1</tt>
    boot paramenter option.

    Check that not boot entries in <tt>/boot/loader/entries/*.conf</tt> have
    <tt>systemd.debug-shell=1</tt> included in its options.<br />
    To ensure that new kernels and boot entries don't enable the debug-shell, check
    that <tt>systemd.debug-shell=1</tt> is not present in <tt>/etc/kernel/cmdline</tt>.

rationale: |-
    This prevents attackers with physical access from trivially bypassing security
    on the machine through valid troubleshooting configurations and gaining root
    access when the system is rebooted.

ocil_clause: 'the comand returns a line'

ocil: |-
    Ensure that debug-shell service is not enabled with the following command:
    <pre>sudo grep -L "^options\s+.*\bsystemd.debug-shell=1\b" /boot/loader/entries/*.conf</pre>
    No line should be returned, each line returned is a boot entry that enables the debug-shell.
