title: 'Enable page allocator poisoning in zIPL'

description: |-
    To enable poisoning of free pages,
    check that all boot entries in <tt>/boot/loader/entries/*.conf</tt> have <tt>page_poison=1</tt>
    included in its options.<br />
    Make sure <tt>/etc/zipl.conf</tt> doesn't contain <tt>image = </tt> setting,
    as {{{ full_name }}} adheres to Boot Loader Specification (BLS).<br />
    And run <tt>zipl</tt> command so that <tt>/boot/bootmap</tt> is updated.<br />

    To ensure that new kernels and boot entries continue to enable page poisoning,
    add <tt>page_poison=1</tt> to <tt>/etc/kernel/cmdline</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Poisoning writes an arbitrary value to freed pages, so any modification or
    reference to that page after being freed or before being initialized will be
    detected and prevented.
    This prevents many types of use-after-free vulnerabilities at little performance cost.
    Also prevents leak of data and detection of corrupted memory.

ocil_clause: 'page allocator poisoning is not enabled'

ocil: |-
  To check that page poisoning is enabled at boot time, check all boot entries with following command:
  <pre>sudo grep -L "^options\s+.*\bpage_poison=1\b" /boot/loader/entries/*.conf</pre>
  No line should be returned, each line returned is a boot entry that doesn't enable page poisoning.

  Check that no image file is specified in <tt>/etc/zipl.conf</tt>:
  <pre>grep -R "^image\s*=" /etc/zipl.conf</pre>
  No line should be returned, if a line is returned zipl may load a different kernel than intended.

  And make sure that <tt>/boot/bootmap</tt> is newer than <tt>/boot/loader/entries/*.conf</tt>
  and <tt>/etc/zipl.conf</tt>:
  <pre>find /boot/loader/entries/*.conf /etc/zipl.conf -newer /boot/bootmap</pre>
  No line should be returned, if a line is returned <tt>/boot/bootmap</tt> needs to be regenerated.
