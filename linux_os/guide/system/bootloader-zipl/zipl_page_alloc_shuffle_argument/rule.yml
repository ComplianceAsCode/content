title: 'Enable randomization of the page allocator in zIPL'

description: |-
    To enable the randomization of the page allocator in the kernel, check that
    all boot entries in <tt>/boot/loader/entries/*.conf</tt> have
    <tt>page_alloc.shuffle=1</tt> included in its options.<br />

    To enable randomization of the page allocator also for  newly installed
    kernels, add <tt>page_alloc.shuffle=1</tt> to <tt>/etc/kernel/cmdline</tt>.

rationale: |-
    The <tt>CONFIG_SHUFFLE_PAGE_ALLOCATOR</tt> config option is primarily
    focused on improving the average utilization of a direct-mapped
    memory-side-cache. Aside of this performance effect, it also reduces
    predictability of page allocations in situations when the bad actor can
    crash the system and somehow leverage knowledge of (page) allocation order
    right after a fresh reboot, or can control the timing between a
    hot-pluggable memory node (as in NUMA node) and applications allocating
    memory ouf of that node. The <tt>page_alloc.shuffle=1</tt> kernel command
    line parameter then forces this functionality irrespectively of memory cache
    architecture.

ocil_clause: 'randomization of the page allocator is not enabled in the kernel'

ocil: |-
  To check that the randomization of the page allocator in the kernel is
  enabled, check all boot entries with following command:
  <pre>sudo grep -L"^options\s+.*\bpage_alloc\.shuffle=1\b" /boot/loader/entries/*.conf</pre>
  No line should be returned, each line returned is a boot entry that doesn't enable audit.
