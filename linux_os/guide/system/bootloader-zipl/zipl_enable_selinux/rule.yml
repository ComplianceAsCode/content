title: 'Ensure SELinux Not Disabled in zIPL'

description: |-
    To ensure SELinux is not disabled at boot time,
    check that no boot entry in <tt>/boot/loader/entries/*.conf</tt> has <tt>selinux=0</tt>
    included in its options.<br />

rationale: |-
    Disabling a major host protection feature, such as SELinux, at boot time prevents
    it from confining system services at boot time.  Further, it increases
    the chances that it will remain off during system operation.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: 'SELinux is disabled at boot time'

ocil: |-
    To check that SELinux is not disabled at boot time;
    Check that no boot entry disables selinux:
    <pre>sudo grep -L "^options\s+.*\bselinux=0\b" /boot/loader/entries/*.conf</pre>
    No line should be returned, each line returned is a boot entry that disables SELinux.
