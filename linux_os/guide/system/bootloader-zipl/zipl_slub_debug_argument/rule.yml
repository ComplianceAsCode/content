title: 'Enable SLUB/SLAB allocator poisoning in zIPL'

description: |-
    To enable poisoning of SLUB/SLAB objects,
    check that all boot entries in <tt>/boot/loader/entries/*.conf</tt> have <tt>slub_debug=P</tt>
    included in its options.<br />
    To ensure that new kernels and boot entries continue to enable poisoning of SLUB/SLAB objects,
    add <tt>slub_debug=P</tt> to <tt>/etc/kernel/cmdline</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Poisoning writes an arbitrary value to freed objects, so any modification or
    reference to that object after being freed or before being initialized will be
    detected and prevented.
    This prevents many types of use-after-free vulnerabilities at little performance cost.
    Also prevents leak of data and detection of corrupted memory.

ocil_clause: 'SLUB/SLAB poisoning is not enabled'

ocil: |-
  To check that SLUB/SLAB poisoning is enabled, check all boot entries with following command;
  <pre>sudo grep -L "^options\s+.*\bslub_debug=P\b" /boot/loader/entries/*.conf</pre>
  No line should be returned, each line returned is a boot entry that does not enable poisoning.
