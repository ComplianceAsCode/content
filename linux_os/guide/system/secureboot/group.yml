title: 'Secure boot configuration'

description: |-
  Secure Boot is a protocol that enables a safe and trusted path during the Linux boot process.
  It verifies that the code the firmware loads on a motherboard is the code
  that the user intends for the computer to load.

  Secure Boot is part of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). The protocol
  defines a process that prevents the loading of unsigned drivers, boot loaders, or
  kernel modules (or those with unacceptable digital signatures). When Secure Boot
  is enabled, system boot loaders, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel, and all
  kernel modules must be cryptographically signed with a private key.
  This allows them to be authenticated with the corresponding public key.
