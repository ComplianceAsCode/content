title: 'Ensure AppArmor is enabled in the bootloader configuration'

description: |-
    Configure AppArmor to be enabled at boot time and verify that it has not been
    overwritten by the bootloader boot parameters.

    Note: This recommendation is designed around the grub bootloader, if LILO or
    another bootloader is in use in your environment, enact equivalent settings.

rationale: |-
    AppArmor must be enabled at boot time in your bootloader configuration to
    ensure that the controls it provides are not overridden.
