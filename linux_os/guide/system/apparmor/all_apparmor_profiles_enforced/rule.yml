title:  'Enforce all AppArmor Profiles'

description: |-
    AppArmor profiles define what resources applications are able to access.
    To set all profiles to enforce mode run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/*</pre>
    To list unconfined processes run the following command:
    {{% if 'ubuntu' in product or 'debian' in product %}}
    <pre>$ sudo apparmor_status | grep processes</pre>
    {{% else %}}
    <pre>$ sudo aa-unconfined</pre>
    {{% endif %}}
    Any unconfined processes may need to have a profile created or activated
    for them and then be restarted.

rationale: |-
    Security configuration requirements vary from site to site. Some sites may
    mandate a policy that is stricter than the default policy, which is perfectly
    acceptable. This recommendation is intended to ensure that any policies that
    exist on the system are activated.
