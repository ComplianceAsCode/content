title: 'Ensure all AppArmor Profiles are in enforce or complain mode'

description: |-
    AppArmor profiles define what resources applications are able to access.

rationale: |-
    Security configuration requirements vary from site to site. Some sites
    may mandate a policy that is stricter than the default policy, which is
    perfectly acceptable. This item is intended to ensure that any policies
    that exist on the system are activated.
