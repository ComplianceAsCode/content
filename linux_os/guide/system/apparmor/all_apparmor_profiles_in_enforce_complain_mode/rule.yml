title:  'All AppArmor Profiles are in enforce or complain mode'

description: |-
    AppArmor profiles define what resources applications are able to access.
    To set all profiles to either <tt>enforce</tt> or <tt>complain</tt>  mode
    run the following command to set all profiles to <tt>enforce</tt> mode:
    <pre>$ sudo aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/*</pre>
    run the following command to set all profiles to <tt>complain</tt> mode:
    <pre>$ sudo aa-complain /etc/apparmor.d/*</pre>
    To list unconfined processes run the following command:
    {{% if 'ubuntu' in product %}}
    <pre>$ sudo apparmor_status | grep processes</pre>
    {{% else %}}
    <pre>$ sudo aa-unconfined</pre>
    {{% endif %}}
    Any unconfined processes may need to have a profile created or activated
    for them and then be restarted.

rationale: |-
    Security configuration requirements vary from site to site. Some sites may
    mandate a policy that is stricter than the default policy, which is perfectly
    acceptable. This recommendation is intended to ensure that any policies that
    exist on the system are activated.
