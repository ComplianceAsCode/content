title: AppArmor

description: |-
    Many security vulnerabilities result from bugs in trusted programs. A trusted
    program runs with privileges that attackers want to possess. The program fails
    to keep that trust if there is a bug in the program that allows the attacker to
    acquire said privilege.
    <br /><br />
    AppArmor® is an application security solution designed specifically to apply
    privilege confinement to suspect programs. AppArmor allows the administrator to
    specify the domain of activities the program can perform by developing a
    security profile. A security profile is a listing of files that the program may
    access and the operations the program may perform. AppArmor secures
    applications by enforcing good application behavior without relying on attack
    signatures, so it can prevent attacks even if previously unknown
    vulnerabilities are being exploited.
