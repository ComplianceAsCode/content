title: 'Configure SELinux Policy'

description: |-
    The SELinux <tt>targeted</tt> policy is appropriate for
    general-purpose desktops and servers, as well as systems in many other roles.
    To configure the system to use this policy, add or correct the following line
    in <tt>/etc/selinux/config</tt>:
    <pre>SELINUXTYPE=<sub idref="var_selinux_policy_name" /></pre>
    Other policies, such as <tt>mls</tt>, provide additional security labeling
    and greater confinement but are not compatible with many general-purpose
    use cases.

rationale: |-
    Setting the SELinux policy to <tt>targeted</tt> or a more specialized policy
    ensures the system will confine processes that are likely to be
    targeted for exploitation, such as network or system services.
    <br /><br />
    Note: During the development or debugging of SELinux modules, it is common to
    temporarily place non-production systems in <tt>permissive</tt> mode. In such
    temporary cases, SELinux policies should be developed, and once work
    is completed, the system should be reconfigured to
    <tt><sub idref="var_selinux_policy_name" /></tt>.
