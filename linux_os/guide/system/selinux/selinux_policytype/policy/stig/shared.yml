    {{{ full_name }}} must enable the SELinux targeted policy.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Setting the SELinux policy to "targeted" or a more specialized policy
    ensures the system will confine processes that are likely to be
    targeted for exploitation, such as network or system services.



    Note: During the development or debugging of SELinux modules, it is common to
    temporarily place non-production systems in "permissive" mode. In such
    temporary cases, SELinux policies should be developed, and once work
    is completed, the system should be reconfigured to
    "targeted".

checktext: |-
    Verify the SELINUX on {{{ full_name }}} is using the targeted policy with the following command:

    $ sestatus | grep policy

    Loaded policy name:             targeted

    If the loaded policy name is not "targeted", this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to use the targetd SELINUX policy.

    Edit the file "/etc/selinux/config" and add or modify the following line:

     SELINUXTYPE=targeted

    A reboot is required for the changes to take effect.
