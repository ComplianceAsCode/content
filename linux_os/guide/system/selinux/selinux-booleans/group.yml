title: 'SELinux - Booleans'


# Please note that the `sebool` template used in this group is a bit special.
# The Bash remediation of the template can remediate even if selinux is totally disabled, because it uses `setsebool -P`.
# But OVAL check and Ansible remediation will not work with disabled selinux.
# When hardening in Imagebuilder or Bootc environment, Bash remediations are used, no checks are performed.
# therefore, the `selinux` platform guards against running OVAL or Ansible on system with selinux disabled / not present.
# The `osbuild` and `bootc` platform allows to run Bash remediations in these environments.
platform: selinux or bootc or osbuild
