title: 'Ensure No Daemons are Unconfined by SELinux'

description: |-
    Daemons for which the SELinux policy does not contain rules will inherit the
    context of the parent process. Because daemons are launched during
    startup and descend from the <tt>init</tt> process, they inherit the <tt>initrc_t</tt> context.
    <br />
    <br />
    To check for unconfined daemons, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo ps -eZ | egrep "initrc" | egrep -vw "tr|ps|egrep|bash|awk" | tr ':' ' ' | awk '{ print $NF }'</pre>
    It should produce no output in a well-configured system.

rationale: |-
    Daemons which run with the <tt>initrc_t</tt> context may cause AVC denials,
    or allow privileges that the daemon does not require.

warnings:
    - general: |-
        Automatic remediation of this control is not available. Remediation
        can be achieved by amending SELinux policy or stopping the unconfined
        daemons as outlined above.
