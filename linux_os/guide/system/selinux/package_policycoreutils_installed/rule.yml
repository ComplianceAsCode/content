title: 'Install policycoreutils Package'

description: |-
    {{{ describe_package_install(package="policycoreutils") }}}

rationale: |-
    Security-enhanced Linux is a feature of the Linux kernel and a number of utilities
    with enhanced security functionality designed to add mandatory access controls to Linux.
    The Security-enhanced Linux kernel contains new architectural components originally
    developed to improve security of the Flask operating system. These architectural components
    provide general support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access control
    policies, including those based on the concepts of Type Enforcement, Role-based Access
    Control, and Multi-level Security. 

    <tt>policycoreutils</tt> contains the policy core utilities that are required for
    basic operation of an SELinux-enabled system. These utilities include <tt>load_policy</tt>
    to load SELinux policies, <tt>setfiles</tt> to label filesystems, <tt>newrole</tt> to
    switch roles, and <tt>run_init</tt> to run <tt>/etc/init.d</tt> scripts in the proper
    context.
