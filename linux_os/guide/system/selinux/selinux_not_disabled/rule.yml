title: 'Ensure SELinux is Not Disabled'

description: |-
    The SELinux state should be set to <tt>enforcing</tt> or <tt>permissive</tt> at system boot
    time. In the file <tt>/etc/selinux/config</tt>, add or correct the following line to configure
    the system to boot into enforcing or permissive mode:
    <pre>SELINUX=enforcing</pre>
    OR
    <pre>SELINUX=permissive</pre>

rationale: |-
    Running SELinux in disabled mode is strongly discouraged. It prevents enforcing the SELinux
    controls without a system reboot. It also avoids labeling any persistent objects such as
    files, making it difficult to enable SELinux in the future.

ocil_clause: 'SELinux is disabled'

ocil: |-
    Ensure that {{{ full_name }}} does not disable SELinux.

    Check if "SELinux" is active and in "enforcing" or "permissive" mode with the following command:

    $ sudo getenforce
    Enforcing
    -OR-
    Permissive

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to enable SELinux.

    Edit the file <tt>/etc/selinux/config</tt> and add or modify the following line:
    <pre>SELINUX=enforcing</pre>
    OR
    <pre>SELINUX=permissive</pre>

    A reboot is required for the changes to take effect.

warnings:
    - general: |-
        In case the SELinux is "disabled", the automated remediation will adopt a more
        conservative approach and set it to "permissive" in order to avoid any system disruption
        and give the administrator the opportunity to assess the impact and necessary efforts
        before setting it to "enforcing", which is strongly recommended.
