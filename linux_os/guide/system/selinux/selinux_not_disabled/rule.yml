title: 'Ensure SELinux is Not Disabled'

description: |-
    The SELinux state should be set to <tt>enforcing</tt> or <tt>permissive</tt> at system boot
    time. In the file <tt>/etc/selinux/config</tt>, add or correct the following line to configure
    the system to boot into enforcing or permissive mode:
    <pre>SELINUX=enforcing</pre>
    OR
    <pre>SELINUX=permissive</pre>
    If SELinux is currently disabled or not configured, ensure that all files have correct SELinux
    labels by running:
    <pre>fixfiles onboot</pre>
    Then reboot the system.

rationale: |-
    Running SELinux in disabled mode is strongly discouraged. It prevents enforcing the SELinux
    controls without a system reboot. It also avoids labeling any persistent objects such as
    files, making it difficult to enable SELinux in the future.

ocil_clause: 'SELinux is disabled'

ocil: |-
    Ensure that {{{ full_name }}} does not disable SELinux.

    Check if "SELinux" is active and in "enforcing" or "permissive" mode with the following command:

    $ sudo getenforce
    Enforcing
    -OR-
    Permissive

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to enable SELinux.

    If SELinux is currently set to "enforcing" or "permissive" in /etc/selinux/config,
    the system is compliant and no changes are needed.

    If SELinux is disabled or not configured, edit the file <tt>/etc/selinux/config</tt>
    and add or modify the following line:
    <pre>SELINUX=enforcing</pre>
    OR
    <pre>SELINUX=permissive</pre>

    A reboot is required for the changes to take effect.

warnings:
    - general: |-
        The automated remediation checks the SELinux configuration in /etc/selinux/config.
        If SELinux is already set to "enforcing" or "permissive", the current state is preserved
        and no changes are made. If SELinux is "disabled" or not configured, the remediation will
        adopt a conservative approach and set it to "permissive" in order to avoid any system
        disruption and give the administrator the opportunity to assess the impact and necessary
        efforts before setting it to "enforcing", which is strongly recommended.
