title: 'Elevate The SELinux Context When An Administrator Calls The Sudo Command'

description: |-
    Configure the operating system to elevate the SELinux context when an administrator calls
    the sudo command.
    Edit a file in the /etc/sudoers.d directory with the following command:
    <pre>sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/<i>CUSTOM_FILE</i></pre>
    Use the following example to build the <i>CUSTOM_FILE</i> in the /etc/sudoers.d directory
    to allow any administrator belonging to a designated sudoers admin group to elevate their
    SELinux context with the use of the sudo command:
    <pre>%wheel ALL=(ALL) TYPE=sysadm_t ROLE=sysadm_r ALL</pre>

rationale: |-
    Preventing non-privileged users from executing privileged functions mitigates
    the risk that unauthorized individuals or processes may gain unnecessary access
    to information or privileges.
    <br /><br />
    Privileged functions include, for example,
    establishing accounts, performing system integrity checks, or administering
    cryptographic key management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals
    who do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection
    and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples
    of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users.

ocil: |-
    Verify the operating system elevates the SELinux context when an administrator calls the
    sudo command with the following command:
    <br /><br />
    This command must be ran as root:
