    Verify Permissions on Important Files and
    Directories Are Configured in /etc/permissions.local

description: |-
    Permissions for many files on a system must be set
    restrictively to ensure sensitive information is properly protected.
    This section discusses the <tt>/etc/permissions.local</tt> file, where
    expected permissions can be configured to be checked and fixed through
    usage of the <tt>chkstat</tt> command.
