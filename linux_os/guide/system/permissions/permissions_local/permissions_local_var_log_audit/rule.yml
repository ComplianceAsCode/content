title: 'Verify that Local Logs of the audit Daemon are not World-Readable'

description: |-
    Files containing sensitive informations should be protected by restrictive
    permissions. Most of the time, there is no need that these files need to be read by any non-root user.

    Check that "permissions.local" file contains the correct permissions rules with the following command:

    <pre># grep -i audit /etc/permissions.local

    /var/log/audit/ root:root 600
    /var/log/audit/audit.log root:root 600
    /etc/audit/audit.rules root:root 640</pre>

rationale: |-
    Without the capability to restrict which roles and individuals can select
    which events are audited, unauthorized personnel may be able to prevent the
    auditing of critical events. Misconfigured audits may degrade the system's
    performance by overwhelming the audit log. Misconfigured audits may also
    make it more difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events
    relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

    Check that <tt>permissions.local</tt> file contains the correct permissions rules with the following command:

    <pre># grep -i audit /etc/permissions.local

    /var/log/audit/ root:root 600
    /var/log/audit/audit.log root:root 600
    /etc/audit/audit.rules root:root 640</pre>

    If the command does not return all the above lines, the missing ones need to be added.

    Run the following command to correct the permissions after adding missing entries:

    <pre># sudo chkstat --set --system</pre>
