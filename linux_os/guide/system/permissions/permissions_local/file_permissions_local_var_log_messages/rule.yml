title: 'Verify that local /var/log/messages is not world-readable'

description: |-
    Files containing sensitive informations should be protected by restrictive
    permissions. Most of the time, there is no need that these files need to be read by any non-root user
    {{{ describe_file_permissions(file="/var/log/messages", perms="0640") }}}

    Check that "permissions.local" file contains the correct permissions rules with the following command:

    <pre># grep -i messages /etc/permissions.local

    /var/log/messages root:root 640</pre>

rationale: |-
    The <tt>/var/log/messages</tt> file contains system error messages. Only
    authorized personnel should be aware of errors and the details of the
    errors. Error messages are an indicator of an organization's operational
    state or can identify the SUSE operating system or platform. Additionally,
    Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and operational information must
    not be revealed through error messages to unauthorized personnel or their
    designated representatives.

ocil_clause: 'Make sure /var/log/messages is not world-readable'

ocil: |-
    {{{ ocil_file_permissions(file="/var/log/messages", perms="-rw-r-----") }}}

    Check that <tt>permissions.local</tt> file contains the correct permissions rules with the following command:

    <pre># grep -i messages /etc/permissions.local

    /var/log/messages root:root 640</pre>

    If the command does not return any or different output, this is a finding.

    Run the following command to correct the permissions after adding the missing entry:

    <pre># sudo chkstat --set --system</pre>
