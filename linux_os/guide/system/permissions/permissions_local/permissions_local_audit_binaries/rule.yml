title: 'Verify Permissions of Local Logs of audit Tools'

description: |-
    The SUSE operating system audit tools must have the proper permissions
    configured to protect against unauthorized access.

    Check that "permissions.local" file contains the correct permissions rules
    with the following command:

    <pre>grep "^/usr/sbin/au" /etc/permissions.local

    /usr/sbin/audispd root:root 0750
    /usr/sbin/auditctl root:root 0750
    /usr/sbin/auditd root:root 0750
    /usr/sbin/ausearch root:root 0755
    /usr/sbin/aureport root:root 0755
    /usr/sbin/autrace root:root 0750
    /usr/sbin/augenrules root:root 0750
    </pre>

    Audit tools include but are not limited to vendor-provided and open-source
    audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information
    system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report
    generators.

rationale: |-
    Protecting audit information also includes identifying and protecting the
    tools used to view and manipulate log data. Therefore, protecting audit
    tools is necessary to prevent unauthorized operation on audit information.

    SUSE operating systems providing tools to interface with audit information
    will leverage user permissions and roles identifying the user accessing the
    tools and the corresponding rights the user enjoys to make access decisions
    regarding the access to audit tools.

    Check that <tt>permissions.local</tt> file contains the correct permissions
    rules with the following command:

    <pre>grep "^/usr/sbin/au" /etc/permissions.local

    /usr/sbin/audispd root:root 0750
    /usr/sbin/auditctl root:root 0750
    /usr/sbin/auditd root:root 0750
    /usr/sbin/ausearch root:root 0755
    /usr/sbin/aureport root:root 0755
    /usr/sbin/autrace root:root 0750
    /usr/sbin/augenrules root:root 0750
    </pre>

    If the command does not return all the above lines, the missing ones need
    to be added.

    Run the following command to correct the permissions after adding missing
    entries:

    <pre># sudo chkstat --set --system</pre>
