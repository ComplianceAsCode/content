    ensure the following line is is included in a file ending in <tt>.conf</tt> under
    <tt>/etc/tmpfiles.d/</tt>.
    <pre>
        C /root/.bash_logout   600 root root - /usr/share/rootfiles/.bash_logout
    </pre>

rationale: |-
    Local initialization files are used to configure the user's shell environment
    upon logon. Malicious modification of these files could compromise accounts upon
    logon.
