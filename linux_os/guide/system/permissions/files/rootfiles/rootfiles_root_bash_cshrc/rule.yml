    <tt>/etc/tmpfiles.d/</tt>.
    <pre>
        C /root/.cshrc   600 root root - /usr/share/rootfiles/.cshrc
    </pre>

    Local initialization files are used to configure the user's shell environment
    upon logon. Malicious modification of these files could compromise accounts upon
    logon.
