    The {{{ full_name }}} /etc/audit/auditd.conf file must have 0640 or less permissive to prevent unauthorized access.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Without the capability to restrict the roles and individuals that can select which events
    are audited, unauthorized personnel may be able to prevent the auditing of critical
    events. Misconfigured audits may degrade the system's performance by overwhelming
    the audit log. Misconfigured audits may also make it more difficult to establish,
    correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify
    those responsible for one.

    Verify the mode of /etc/audit/auditd.conf with the command:

    $ sudo stat -c "%a %n" /etc/audit/auditd.conf

    640 /etc/audit/auditd.conf

    If "/etc/audit/auditd.conf" does not have a mode of "0640", this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Set the mode of /etc/audit/auditd.conf file to 0640 with the command:

    $ sudo chmod 0640 /etc/audit/auditd.conf
