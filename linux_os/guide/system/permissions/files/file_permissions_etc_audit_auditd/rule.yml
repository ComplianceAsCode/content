title: 'Verify Permissions on /etc/audit/auditd.conf'

description: |-
    {{{ describe_file_permissions(file="/etc/audit/auditd.conf", perms="0640") }}}


rationale: |-
    Without the capability to restrict the roles and individuals that can select which events
    are audited, unauthorized personnel may be able to prevent the auditing of critical
    events. Misconfigured audits may degrade the system's performance by overwhelming
    the audit log. Misconfigured audits may also make it more difficult to establish,
    correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify
    those responsible for one.
