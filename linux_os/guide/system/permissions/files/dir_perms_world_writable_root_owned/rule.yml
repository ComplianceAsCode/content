title: 'Ensure All World-Writable Directories Are Owned by root user'

description: |-
    All directories in local partitions which are world-writable should be owned
    by root. If any world-writable directories are not owned by root, this
    should be investigated. Following this, the files should be deleted or
    assigned to root user.

rationale: |-
    Allowing a user account to own a world-writable directory is
    undesirable because it allows the owner of that directory to remove
    or replace any files that may be placed in the directory by other
    users.
