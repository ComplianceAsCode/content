title: 'Ensure All World-Writable Directories Are Owned by root User'

description: |-
    All directories in local partitions which are world-writable should be owned by root.
    If any world-writable directories are not owned by root, this should be investigated.
    Following this, the files should be deleted or assigned to root user.

rationale: |-
    Allowing a user account to own a world-writable directory is undesirable because it allows the
    owner of that directory to remove or replace any files that may be placed in the directory by
    other users.
