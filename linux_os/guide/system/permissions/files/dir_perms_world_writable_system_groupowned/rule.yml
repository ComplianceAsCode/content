title: 'Ensure All World-Writable Directories Are Group-Owned by a System Group'

description: |-
    All directories in local partitions which are world-writable should be
    group-owned by <tt>root</tt>, <tt>sys</tt>, <tt>bin</tt> or an application
    group. If any world-writable directories are not group-owned by such a
    group, this should be investigated. Following this, the files should be
    deleted or assigned to an appropriate group.

rationale: |-
    If a world-writable directory has the sticky bit set and is not group-owned
    by a privileged Group Identifier (GID), unauthorized users may be able to
    modify files created by others.

    The only authorized public directories are those temporary directories
    supplied with the system or those designed to be temporary file
    repositories. The setting is normally reserved for directories used by the
    system and by users for temporary file storage, (e.g., <tt>/tmp</tt>), and
    for directories requiring global read/write access.

ocil: |-
    The following command will discover and print world-writable directories that
    are not owned by a system account, given the assumption that only system
    groups have a uid lower than 1000.  Run it once for each local partition <i>PART</i>:
    <pre>$ sudo find <i>PART</i> -xdev -type d -perm -0002 -gid +999 -print</pre>
