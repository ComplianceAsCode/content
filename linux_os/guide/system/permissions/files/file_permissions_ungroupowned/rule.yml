title: 'Ensure All Files Are Owned by a Group'

description: |-
    If any files are not owned by a group, then the
    cause of their lack of group-ownership should be investigated.
    Following this, the files should be deleted or assigned to an
    appropriate group.

rationale: |-
    Unowned files do not directly imply a security problem, but they are generally
    a sign that something is amiss. They may
    be caused by an intruder, by incorrect software installation or
    draft software removal, or by failure to remove all files belonging
    to a deleted account. The files should be repaired so they
    will not cause problems when accounts are created in the future,
    and the cause should be discovered and addressed.

    The following command will discover and print any
    files on local partitions which do not belong to a valid group.
    <pre>$ sudo find / -xdev -fstype local -nogroup</pre>
    <br />
    Either remove all files and directories from the system that do not have a valid group,
    or assign a valid group with the chgrp command:
    <pre>$ sudo chgrp <i>group</i> <i>file</i></pre>
