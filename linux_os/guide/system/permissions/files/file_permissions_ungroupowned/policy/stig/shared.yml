srg_requirement: |-
    All {{{ full_name }}} local files and directories must have a valid group owner.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Files without a valid group owner may be unintentionally inherited if a group is assigned the same Group Identifier (GID) as the GID of the files without a valid group owner.

checktext: |-
    Verify all local files and directories on {{{ full_name }}} have a valid group with the following command:

    $ df --local -P | awk {'if (NR!=1) print $6'} | sudo xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev -nogroup

    If any files on the system do not have an assigned group, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Either remove all files and directories from {{{ full_name }}} that do not have a valid group, or assign a valid group to all files and directories on the system with the "chgrp" command:

    $ sudo chgrp &lt;group&gt; &lt;file&gt;
