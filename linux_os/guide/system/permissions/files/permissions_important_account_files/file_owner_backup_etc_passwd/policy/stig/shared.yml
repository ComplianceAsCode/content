    The "/etc/passwd-" file is a backup file of "/etc/passwd", and as such,
    it contains information about the users that are configured on the system.
    Protection of this file is critical for system security.

    To check the ownership of /etc/passwd- ,
    run the command:
     $ sudo stat -c "%U %n" /etc/passwd-
