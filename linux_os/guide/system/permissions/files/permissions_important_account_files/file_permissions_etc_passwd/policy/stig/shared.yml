    The {{{ full_name }}} /etc/group file must have 0644 or less permissive to prevent unauthorized access.

    If the "/etc/passwd" file is writable by a group-owner or the
    world the risk of its compromise is increased. The file contains the list of
    accounts on the system and associated information, and protection of this file
    is critical for system security.

checktext: |-
    To check the permissions of /etc/passwd ,
    run the command:
     $ sudo stat -c "%a %n"/etc/passwd
    If properly configured, the output should indicate the following permissions:
    644

    If /etc/passwd does not have unix mode 644, then this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Change the permissions of the file "/etc/group" to "0644" by running the following command:
    $ sudo chmod 0644 /etc/group
