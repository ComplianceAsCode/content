    The {{{ full_name }}} /etc/passwd file must have mode 0644 or less permissive to prevent unauthorized access.

vuldiscussion: |-
    If the "/etc/passwd" file is writable by a group-owner or the
    world the risk of its compromise is increased. The file contains the list of
    accounts on the system and associated information, and protection of this file
    is critical for system security.

checktext: |-
    Verify that the "/etc/passwd" file has mode "0644" or less permissive with the following command:

    $ sudo stat -c "%a %n" /etc/passwd

    644 /etc/passwd

    If a value of "0644" or less permissive is not returned, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Change the mode of the file "/etc/passwd" to "0644" by running the following command:

    $ sudo chmod 0644 /etc/passwd
