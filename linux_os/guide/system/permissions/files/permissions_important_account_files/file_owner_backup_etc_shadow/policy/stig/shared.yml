    The {{{ full_name }}} /etc/shadow- file must be group-owned by root.

vuldiscussion: |-
    The "/etc/shadow-" file is a backup file of "/etc/shadow", and as such,
    it contains the list of local system accounts and password hashes.
    Protection of this file is critical for system security.

    To check the ownership of /etc/shadow- ,
    run the command:
     $ sudo stat -c "%U %n" /etc/shadow-
    If properly configured, the output should indicate the following owner:
     root /etc/shadow

    If /etc/shadow- does not have an owner of root, then this is a finding.
