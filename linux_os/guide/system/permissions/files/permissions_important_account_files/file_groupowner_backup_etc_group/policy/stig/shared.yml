    The {{{ full_name }}} /etc/group- file must be group-owned by root.

vuldiscussion: |-
    The "/etc/group-" file is a backup file of "/etc/group", and as such,
    it contains information regarding groups that are configured on the system.
    Protection of this file is important for system security.

checktext: |-
    To check the group ownership of /etc/group- ,
    run the command:
     $ sudo stat -c "%U %n" /etc/group-
    If properly configured, the output should indicate the following group-owner:
     root /etc/group-

    If /etc/group- does not have a group owner of root, then this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Change the group of the file /etc/group- to root by running the following command:
    $ sudo chgrp root /etc/group-
