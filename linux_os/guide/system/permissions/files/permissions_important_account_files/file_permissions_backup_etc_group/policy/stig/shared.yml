    The "/etc/group-" file is a backup file of "/etc/group", and as such,
    it contains information regarding groups that are configured on the system.
    Protection of this file is important for system security.

    To check the permissions of /etc/group- ,
    run the command:
     $ sudo stat -c "%a %n" /etc/group-
    If properly configured, the output should indicate the following permissions:
    644 /etc/group-

    If /etc/group- does not have unix mode 644, then this is a finding.
