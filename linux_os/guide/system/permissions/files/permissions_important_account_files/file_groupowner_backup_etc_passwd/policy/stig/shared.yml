    The {{{ full_name }}} /etc/passwd- file must be group-owned by root.

vuldiscussion: |-
    The "/etc/passwd-" file is a backup file of "/etc/passwd", and as such,
    it contains information about the users that are configured on the system.
    Protection of this file is critical for system security.

checktext: |-
    To check the group ownership of /etc/passwd- ,
    run the command:
     $ sudo stat -c "%G %n" /etc/passwd-
    If properly configured, the output should indicate the following group-owner:
     root

    If /etc/passwd- does not have a group owner of root, then this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Change the group of the file /etc/passwd- to root by running the following command:
    $ sudo chgrp root /etc/passwd-
