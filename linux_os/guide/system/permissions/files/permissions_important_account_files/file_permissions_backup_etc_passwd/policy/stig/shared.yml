    The {{{ full_name }}} /etc/passwd- file must have 0644 or less permissive to prevent unauthorized access.

vuldiscussion: |-
    The "/etc/passwd-" file is a backup file of "/etc/passwd", and as such,
    it contains information about the users that are configured on the system.
    Protection of this file is critical for system security.

checktext: |-
    To check the permissions of /etc/passwd- ,
    run the command:
     $ sudo stat -c "%a %n" /etc/passwd-
    If properly configured, the output should indicate the following permissions:
     644 /etc/passwd-

    If /etc/passwd- does not have unix mode 644, then this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Change the permissions of the file "/etc/passwd-" to "0644" by running the following command:
    $ sudo chmod 0644 /etc/passwd-
