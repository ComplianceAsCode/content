    it contains information about the users that are configured on the system.
    Protection of this file is critical for system security.

    Verify that the "/etc/passwd-" file has mode "0644" or less permissive with the following command:

    $ sudo stat -c "%a %n" /etc/passwd-

    644 /etc/passwd-

    If a value of "0644" or less permissive is not returned, this is a finding.
