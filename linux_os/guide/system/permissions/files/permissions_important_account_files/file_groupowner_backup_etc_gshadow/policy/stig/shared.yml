    The {{{ full_name }}} /etc/gshadow- file must be group-owned by root.

vuldiscussion: |-
    The "/etc/gshadow-" file is a backup of "/etc/gshadow", and as such,
    it contains group password hashes. Protection of this file is critical for system security.

checktext: |-
    To check the group ownership of /etc/gshadow- ,
    run the command:
     $ sudo stat -c "%U %n" /etc/gshadow-
    If properly configured, the output should indicate the following group-owner:
     root

    If /etc/gshadow- does not have a group owner of root, then this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Change the group of the file /etc/gshadow- to root by running the following command:
    $ sudo chgrp root /etc/gshadow-
