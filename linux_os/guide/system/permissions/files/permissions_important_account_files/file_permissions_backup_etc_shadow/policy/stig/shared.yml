    The "/etc/shadow-" file is a backup file of "/etc/shadow", and as such,
    it contains the list of local system accounts and password hashes.
    Protection of this file is critical for system security.

checktext: |-
    To check the permissions of /etc/shadow- ,
    run the command:
     $ sudo stat -c "%a %n" /etc/shadow-
    If properly configured, the output should indicate the following permissions:
    000 /etc/shadow-

    If /etc/shadow- does not have unix mode 000, then this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Change the permissions of the file "/etc/shadow-" to "0000" by running the following command:
    $ sudo chmod 0000 /etc/shadow-
