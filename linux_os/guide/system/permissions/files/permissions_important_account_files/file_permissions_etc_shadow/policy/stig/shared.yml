    The {{{ full_name }}} /etc/shadow file must have 0000 to prevent unauthorized access.

vuldiscussion: |-
    The "/etc/shadow" file contains the list of local
    system accounts and stores password hashes. Protection of this file is
    critical for system security. Failure to give ownership of this file
    to root provides the designated owner with access to sensitive information
    which could weaken the system security posture.

checktext: |-
    To check the permissions of /etc/shadow ,
    run the command:
     $ sudo stat -c "%a %n" /etc/shadow
    If properly configured, the output should indicate the following permissions:
    000

    If /etc/shadow does not have unix mode 000, then this is a finding.

fixtext: |-

    $ sudo chmod 0000 /etc/shadow
