    The {{{ full_name }}} /etc/shadow file must be owned by root.

vuldiscussion: |-
    The "/etc/shadow" file contains the list of local
    system accounts and stores password hashes. Protection of this file is
    critical for system security. Failure to give ownership of this file
    to root provides the designated owner with access to sensitive information
    which could weaken the system security posture.

    Verify the ownership of the "/etc/shadow" file with the following command:

    $ sudo stat -c "%U %n" /etc/shadow

    root /etc/shadow

    If "/etc/shadow" file does not have an owner of "root", this is a finding.

    Change the owner of the file /etc/shadow to root by running the following command:

    $ sudo chown root /etc/shadow
