title: 'Ensure All World-Writable Directories Are Owned by a System Account'

description: |-
    All directories in local partitions which are
    world-writable should be owned by root or another
    system account.  If any world-writable directories are not
    owned by a system account, this should be investigated.
    Following this, the files should be deleted or assigned to an
    appropriate group.

rationale: |-
    Allowing a user account to own a world-writable directory is
    undesirable because it allows the owner of that directory to remove
    or replace any files that may be placed in the directory by other
    users.

ocil: |-
    The following command will discover and print world-writable directories that
    are not owned by a system account, given the assumption that only system
    accounts have a uid lower than 500.  Run it once for each local partition <i>PART</i>:
    <pre>$ sudo find <i>PART</i> -xdev -type d -perm -0002 -uid +499 -print</pre>
