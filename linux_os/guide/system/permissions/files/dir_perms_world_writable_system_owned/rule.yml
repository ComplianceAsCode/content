title: 'Ensure All World-Writable Directories Are Owned by a System Account'

description: |-
    All directories in local partitions which are
    world-writable should be owned by root or another
    system account. If any world-writable directories are not
    owned by a system account, this should be investigated.
    Following this, the files should be deleted or assigned to an
    appropriate owner.

rationale: |-
    Allowing a user account to own a world-writable directory is
    undesirable because it allows the owner of that directory to remove
    or replace any files that may be placed in the directory by other
    users.

    The following command will discover and print world-writable directories that
    are not owned by a system account, given the assumption that only system
    accounts have a uid lower than 500.  Run it once for each local partition <i>PART</i>:
    <pre>$ sudo find <i>PART</i> -xdev -type d -perm -0002 -uid +499 -print</pre>
