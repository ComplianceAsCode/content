title: 'Verify that All World-Writable Directories Have Sticky Bits Set'

description: |-
    When the so-called 'sticky bit' is set on a directory, only the owner of a given file may
    remove that file from the directory. Without the sticky bit, any user with write access to a
    directory may remove any file in the directory. Setting the sticky bit prevents users from
    removing each other's files. In cases where there is no reason for a directory to be
    world-writable, a better solution is to remove that permission rather than to set the sticky
    bit. However, if a directory is used by a particular application, consult that application's
    documentation instead of blindly changing modes.
    <br />
    To set the sticky bit on a world-writable directory <i>DIR</i>, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo chmod +t <i>DIR</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    Failing to set the sticky bit on public directories allows unauthorized users to delete files
    in the directory structure.
    <br /><br />
    The only authorized public directories are those temporary directories supplied with the
    system, or those designed to be temporary file repositories. The setting is normally reserved
    for directories used by the system, by users for temporary file storage (such as <tt>/tmp</tt>),
    and for directories requiring global read/write access.

    Verify that all world-writable directories have the sticky bit set. The following command will list any world-writeable directories that do not have the sticky bit set.

    > for node in $(oc get node -oname); do oc debug $node -- chroot /host /bin/bash -c 'echo -n "$HOSTNAME "; find / -type d \( -perm -0002 -a ! -perm -1000 ! -path "/var/lib/containers/*" ! -path "/var/lib/kubelet/pods/*" ! -path "/sysroot/ostree/deploy/*" \) -print 2>/dev/null' 2>/dev/null; done

    If there are any directories listed in the results, this is a finding.
    {{% else -%}}
    To find world-writable directories that lack the sticky bit, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo find / -type d \( -perm -0002 -a ! -perm -1000 \) -print 2>/dev/null</pre>
    {{% endif -%}}

fixtext: |-
    {{% if product == "rhcos4" -%}}
    Fix the directory permissions, by either removing world-writeable permission, or setting the sticky bit

    > oc debug node/<node_name> -- chroot /host /bin/bash -c 'chmod XXXX <directory>'

    where
      node_name: The name of the node to connect to (oc get node)
      XXXX:  Either 1777 (sticky bit) or 0755 (remove group and world write permission)
      <directory>: The directory on which to correct the permissions
    {{% else -%}}
    Configure all world-writable directories to have the sticky bit set to prevent unauthorized and unintended information transferred via shared system resources.

    Set the sticky bit on all world-writable directories using the command, replace "[World-Writable Directory]" with any directory path missing the sticky bit:

    $ chmod a+t [World-Writable Directory]
    {{% endif -%}}

srg_requirement:
    A sticky bit must be set on all {{{ full_name }}} public directories to prevent unauthorized and unintended information transferred via shared system resources.

warnings:
    - general: |-
        This rule can take a long time to perform the check and might consume a considerable
        amount of resources depending on the number of directories present on the system. It is
        not a problem in most cases, but especially systems with a large number of directories can
        be affected. See <code>https://access.redhat.com/articles/6999111</code>.
