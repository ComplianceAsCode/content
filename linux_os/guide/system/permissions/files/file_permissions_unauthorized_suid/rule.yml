title: 'Ensure All SUID Executables Are Authorized'

prodtype: alinux3,anolis8,fedora,ol7,ol8,ol9,rhel7,rhel8,rhel9,sle12,sle15,uos20

description: |-
    The SUID (set user id) bit should be set only on files that were
    installed via authorized means. A straightforward means of identifying
    unauthorized SUID files is determine if any were not installed as part of an
    RPM package, which is cryptographically verified. Investigate the origin
    of any unpackaged SUID files.
    This configuration check considers authorized SUID files which were installed via RPM.
    It is assumed that when an individual has sudo access to install an RPM
    and all packages are signed with an organizationally-recognized GPG key,
    the software should be considered an approved package on the system.
    Any SUID file not deployed through an RPM will be flagged for further review.

rationale: |-
    Executable files with the SUID permission run with the privileges of
    the owner of the file. SUID files of uncertain provenance could allow for
    unprivileged users to elevate privileges. The presence of these files should be
    strictly controlled on the system.
