    All {{{ full_name }}} local files and directories must have a valid owner.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Unowned files and directories may be unintentionally inherited if a user is assigned the same User Identifier "UID" as the UID of the un-owned files.

checktext: |-
    Verify all local files and directories on {{{ full_name }}} have a valid owner with the following command:

    $ df --local -P | awk {'if (NR!=1) print $6'} | sudo xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev -nouser

    If any files on the system do not have an assigned owner, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Either remove all files and directories from the system that do not have a valid user, or assign a valid user to all unowned files and directories on {{{ full_name }}} with the "chown" command:

    $ sudo chown &lt;user&gt; &lt;file&gt;
