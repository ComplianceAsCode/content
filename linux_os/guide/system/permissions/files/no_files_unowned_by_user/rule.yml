title: 'Ensure All Files Are Owned by a User'

description: |-
    If any files are not owned by a user, then the
    cause of their lack of ownership should be investigated.
    Following this, the files should be deleted or assigned to an
    appropriate user.

rationale: |-
    Unowned files do not directly imply a security problem, but they are generally
    a sign that something is amiss. They may
    be caused by an intruder, by incorrect software installation or
    draft software removal, or by failure to remove all files belonging
    to a deleted account. The files should be repaired so they
    will not cause problems when accounts are created in the future,
    and the cause should be discovered and addressed.

ocil_clause: 'files exist that are not owned by a valid user'

ocil: |-
    The following command will discover and print any
    files on local partitions which do not belong to a valid user.
    <pre>$ sudo find / -xdev -fstype local -nouser</pre>
    <br /><br />
    Either remove all files and directories from the system that do not have a
    valid user, or assign a valid user to all unowned files and directories on
    the system with the <tt>chown</tt> command:
    <pre>$ sudo chown <tt>user</tt> <tt>file</tt></pre>
