title: 'Verify that system commands directories have root as a group owner'



description: |-
    System commands are stored in the following directories:
    by default:
    <pre>/bin 
    /sbin 
    /usr/bin 
    /usr/sbin 
    /usr/local/bin 
    /usr/local/sbin
    </pre>
    All these directories should have <tt>root</tt> user as a group owner. 
    If any system command directory is not group owned by a user other than root 
    correct its ownership with the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo chgrp root <i>DIR</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    If the operating system were to allow any user to make changes to 
    software libraries, then those changes might be implemented without 
    undergoing the appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a 
    robust change management process.
    
    This requirement applies to operating systems with software libraries
    that are accessible and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages. 
    Software libraries also include privileged programs which execute with escalated 
    privileges. Only qualified and authorized individuals must be allowed to obtain 
    access to information system components for purposes of initiating changes, 
    including upgrades and modifications.

ocil_clause: 'any of these directories are not group owned by root'

ocil: |-
    System commands are stored in the following directories:
    <pre>/bin 
    /sbin 
    /usr/bin 
    /usr/sbin 
    /usr/local/bin 
    /usr/local/sbin</pre>
    For each of these directories, run the following command to find directories not
    owned by root:
    <pre>$ sudo find -L <i>$DIR</i> ! -group root -type d -exec chgrp root {} \;</pre>
