title: 'Verify that system commands directories are group owned by root'

description: |-
    System commands files are stored in the following directories by default:
    <pre>/bin
    /sbin
    /usr/bin
    /usr/sbin
    /usr/local/bin
    /usr/local/sbin
    </pre>
    All these directories should be owned by the <tt>root</tt> group.
    If the directory is found to be owned by a group other than root correct
    its ownership with the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo chgrp root <i>DIR</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    If the operating system allows any user to make changes to software
    libraries, then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the
    appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a robust change management
    process.
    This requirement applies to operating systems with software libraries
    that are accessible and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages.
    Software libraries also include privileged programs which execute with
    escalated privileges. Only qualified and authorized individuals must be
    allowed to obtain access to information system components for purposes
    of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.
