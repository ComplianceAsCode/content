title: 'Verify that System Executables Have Restrictive Permissions'

description: |-
    System executables are stored in the following directories by default:
    <pre>/bin
    /sbin
    /usr/bin
    /usr/libexec
    /usr/local/bin
    /usr/local/sbin
    /usr/sbin</pre>
    All files in these directories should not be group-writable or world-writable.
    If any file <i>FILE</i> in these directories is found
    to be group-writable or world-writable, correct its permission with the
    following command:
    <pre>$ sudo chmod go-w <i>FILE</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    System binaries are executed by privileged users, as well as system services,
    and restrictive permissions are necessary to ensure execution of these programs
    cannot be co-opted.

    /usr/bin
    /usr/libexec
