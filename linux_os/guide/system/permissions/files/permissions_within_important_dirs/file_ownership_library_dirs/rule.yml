title: 'Verify that Shared Library Files Have Root Ownership'

description: |-
    System-wide shared library files, which are linked to executables
    during process load time or run time, are stored in the following directories
    by default:
    <pre>/lib
    /lib64
    /usr/lib
    /usr/lib64
    </pre>
    Kernel modules, which can be added to the kernel during runtime, are also
    stored in <tt>/lib/modules</tt>. All files in these directories should be
    owned by the <tt>root</tt> user. If the directory, or any file in these
    directories, is found to be owned by a user other than root correct its
    ownership with the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo chown root <i>FILE</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    Files from shared library directories are loaded into the address
    space of processes (including privileged ones) or of the kernel itself at
    runtime. Proper ownership is necessary to protect the integrity of the system.

    Verify the system-wide shared library files are owned by "root" with the following command:

    $ sudo find -L /lib /lib64 /usr/lib /usr/lib64 ! -user root -exec ls -l {} \;

    Configure the system-wide shared library files (/lib, /lib64, /usr/lib and /usr/lib64) to be protected from unauthorized access.

    Run the following command, replacing "[FILE]" with any library file not owned by "root".

    $ sudo chown root [FILE]

srg_requirement:
    {{{ full_name }}} library files must be owned by root.
