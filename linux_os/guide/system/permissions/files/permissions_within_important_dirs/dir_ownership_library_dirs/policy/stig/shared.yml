srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} library directories must be owned by root.

vuldiscussion: |-
    If {{{ full_name }}} allowed any user to make changes to software libraries, then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a robust change management process.

    This requirement applies to {{{ full_name }}} with software libraries that are accessible and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages. Software libraries also include privileged programs that execute with escalated privileges.

    Verify the system-wide shared library directories are owned by "root" with the following command:

    $ sudo find /lib /lib64 /usr/lib /usr/lib64 ! -user root -type d -exec stat -c "%n %U" '{}' \;

    If any system-wide shared library directory is not owned by root, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the system-wide shared library directories within (/lib, /lib64, /usr/lib and /usr/lib64) to be protected from unauthorized access.

    Run the following command, replacing "[DIRECTORY]" with any library directory not owned by "root".

    $ sudo chown root [DIRECTORY]
