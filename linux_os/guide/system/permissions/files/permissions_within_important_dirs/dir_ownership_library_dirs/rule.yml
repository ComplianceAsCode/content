title: 'Verify that Shared Library Directories Have Root Ownership'

description: |-
    System-wide shared library files, which are linked to executables
    during process load time or run time, are stored in the following directories
    by default:
    <pre>/lib
    /lib64
    /usr/lib
    /usr/lib64
    </pre>
    Kernel modules, which can be added to the kernel during runtime, are also
    stored in <tt>/lib/modules</tt>. All files in these directories should be
    owned by the <tt>root</tt> user. If the  directories, is found to be owned
    by a user other than root correct its
    ownership with the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo chown root <i>DIR</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    Files from shared library directories are loaded into the address
    space of processes (including privileged ones) or of the kernel itself at
    runtime. Proper ownership of library directories is necessary to protect
    the integrity of the system.

ocil_clause: any system-wide shared library directory is not owned by root

ocil: |-
    Verify the system-wide shared library directories are owned by "root" with the following command:

    $ sudo find /lib /lib64 /usr/lib /usr/lib64 ! -user root -type d -exec stat -c "%n %U" '{}' \;

template:
    name: file_owner
    vars:

fixtext: |-
    Configure the system-wide shared library directories within (/lib, /lib64, /usr/lib and /usr/lib64) to be protected from unauthorized access.

    Run the following command, replacing "[DIRECTORY]" with any library directory not owned by "root".

    $ sudo chown root [DIRECTORY]

srg_requirement: '{{{ full_name }}} library directories must be owned by root.'
