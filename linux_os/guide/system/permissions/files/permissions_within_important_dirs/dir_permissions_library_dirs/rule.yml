title: |-
    Verify that Shared Library Directories Have Restrictive Permissions

description: |-
    System-wide shared library directories, which contain are linked to executables
    during process load time or run time, are stored in the following directories
    by default:
    <pre>/lib
    /lib64
    /usr/lib
    /usr/lib64
    </pre>
    Kernel modules, which can be added to the kernel during runtime, are
    stored in <tt>/lib/modules</tt>. All sub-directories in these directories
    should not be group-writable or world-writable. If any file in these
    directories is found to be group-writable or world-writable, correct
    its permission with the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo chmod go-w <i>DIR</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    If the operating system were to allow any user to make changes to software libraries,
    then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the appropriate testing
    and approvals that are part of a robust change management process.

    This requirement applies to operating systems with software libraries that are accessible
    and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages. Software libraries also include
    privileged programs which execute with escalated privileges. Only qualified and authorized
    individuals must be allowed to obtain access to information system components for purposes
    of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.

    Shared libraries are stored in the following directories:
    <pre>/lib
    /lib64
    /usr/lib
    /usr/lib64
    </pre>
    To find shared libraries that are group-writable or world-writable,
    run the following command for each directory <i>DIR</i> which contains shared libraries:
    <pre>$ sudo find -L <i>DIR</i> -perm /022 -type d</pre>
