    If the operating system were to allow any user to make changes to software libraries,
    then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the appropriate testing
    and approvals that are part of a robust change management process.

    This requirement applies to operating systems with software libraries that are accessible
    and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages. Software libraries also include
    privileged programs which execute with escalated privileges. Only qualified and authorized
    individuals must be allowed to obtain access to information system components for purposes
    of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.

    Shared libraries are stored in the following directories:
     /lib
    /lib64
    /usr/lib
    /usr/lib64

    To find shared libraries that are group-writable or world-writable,
    run the following command for each directory DIR which contains shared libraries:
     $ sudo find -L DIR -perm /022 -type d

    If any of these files are group-writable or world-writable, then this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the {{{ full_name }}} library directories to be protected from unauthorized access. Run the following command, replacing "[DIRECTORY]" with any library directory with a mode more permissive than 755.

    $ sudo chmod 755 [DIRECTORY]
