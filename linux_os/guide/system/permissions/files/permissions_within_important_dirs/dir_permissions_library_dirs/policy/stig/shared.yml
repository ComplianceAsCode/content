    {{{ full_name }}} library directories must have mode 755 or less permissive.

    If the operating system were to allow any user to make changes to software libraries,
    then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the appropriate testing
    and approvals that are part of a robust change management process.

    This requirement applies to operating systems with software libraries that are accessible
    and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages. Software libraries also include
    privileged programs which execute with escalated privileges. Only qualified and authorized
    individuals must be allowed to obtain access to information system components for purposes
    of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.

    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} library directories have a mode of 755 or less with the following commands:

     $ sudo find -L /lib -perm /022 -type d
     $ sudo find -L /lib64 -perm /022 -type d
     $ sudo find -L /usr/lib -perm /022 -type d
     $ sudo find -L /usr/lib64 -perm /022 -type d

    If any of these directories are group-writable or world-writable, this is a finding

    Configure the {{{ full_name }}} library directories to be protected from unauthorized access. Run the following command, replacing "[DIRECTORY]" with any library directory with a mode more permissive than 755.

    $ sudo chmod 755 [DIRECTORY]
