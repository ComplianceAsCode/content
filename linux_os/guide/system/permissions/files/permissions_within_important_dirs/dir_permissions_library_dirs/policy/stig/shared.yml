    {{{ full_name }}} library directories must have mode 755 or less permissive.

    If the operating system were to allow any user to make changes to software libraries,
    then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the appropriate testing
    and approvals that are part of a robust change management process.

    This requirement applies to operating systems with software libraries that are accessible
    and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages. Software libraries also include
    privileged programs which execute with escalated privileges. Only qualified and authorized
    individuals must be allowed to obtain access to information system components for purposes
    of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.

    Verify the system-wide shared library directories have mode "755" or less permissive with the following command:

    $ sudo find -L /lib /lib64 /usr/lib /usr/lib64 -perm /022 -type d -exec ls -l {} \;

    If any system-wide shared library file is found to be group-writable or world-writable, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the system-wide shared library directories (/lib, /lib64, /usr/lib and /usr/lib64) to be protected from unauthorized access.

    Run the following command, replacing "[DIRECTORY]" with any library directory with a mode more permissive than 755.

    $ sudo chmod 755 [DIRECTORY]
