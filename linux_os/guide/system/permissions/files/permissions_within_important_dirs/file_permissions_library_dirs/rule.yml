title: 'Verify that Shared Library Files Have Restrictive Permissions'

description: |-
    System-wide shared library files, which are linked to executables
    during process load time or run time, are stored in the following directories
    by default:
    <pre>/lib
    /lib64
    /usr/lib
    /usr/lib64
    </pre>
    Kernel modules, which can be added to the kernel during runtime, are
    stored in <tt>/lib/modules</tt>. All files in these directories
    should not be group-writable or world-writable. If any file in these
    directories is found to be group-writable or world-writable, correct
    its permission with the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo chmod go-w <i>FILE</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    Files from shared library directories are loaded into the address
    space of processes (including privileged ones) or of the kernel itself at
    runtime. Restrictive permissions are necessary to protect the integrity of the system.

    Shared libraries are stored in the following directories:
    <pre>/lib
    /lib64
    /usr/lib
    /usr/lib64
    </pre>
    To find shared libraries that are group-writable or world-writable,
    run the following command for each directory <i>DIR</i> which contains shared libraries:
    <pre>$ sudo find -L <i>DIR</i> -perm /022 -type f</pre>
