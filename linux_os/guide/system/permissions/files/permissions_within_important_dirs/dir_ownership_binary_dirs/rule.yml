title: 'Verify that System Executable Have Root Ownership'

description: |-
    <pre>/bin
    /sbin
    /usr/bin
    /usr/sbin
    /usr/local/bin
    /usr/local/sbin</pre>
    All these directories should be owned by the <tt>root</tt> user.
    If any directory <i>DIR</i> in these directories is found
    to be owned by a user other than root, correct its ownership with the
    following command:
    <pre>$ sudo chown root <i>DIR</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    System binaries are executed by privileged users as well as system services,
    and restrictive permissions are necessary to ensure that their
    execution of these programs cannot be co-opted.

ocil_clause: 'any system executables directories are found to not be owned by root'

ocil: |-
    System executables are stored in the following directories by default:
    <pre>/bin
    /sbin
    /usr/bin
    /usr/local/bin
    /usr/local/sbin
    /usr/sbin</pre>
    For each of these directories, run the following command to find files
    not owned by root:
    <pre>$ sudo find -L <i>DIR/</i> ! -user root -type d -exec chown root {} \;</pre>
