title: 'Verify that System Executables Have Root Ownership'

description: |-
    System executables are stored in the following directories by default:
    <pre>/bin
    /sbin
    /usr/bin
    /usr/libexec
    /usr/local/bin
    /usr/local/sbin
    /usr/sbin</pre>
    All files in these directories should be owned by the <tt>root</tt> user.
    If any file <i>FILE</i> in these directories is found
    to be owned by a user other than root, correct its ownership with the
    following command:
    <pre>$ sudo chown root <i>FILE</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    System binaries are executed by privileged users as well as system services,
    and restrictive permissions are necessary to ensure that their
    execution of these programs cannot be co-opted.

ocil: |-
    System executables are stored in the following directories by default:
    <pre>/bin
    /sbin
    /usr/bin
    /usr/libexec
    /usr/local/bin
    /usr/local/sbin
    /usr/sbin</pre>
    To find system executables that are not owned by <tt>root</tt>,
    run the following command for each directory <i>DIR</i> which contains system executables:
    <pre>$ sudo find <i>DIR/</i> \! -user root</pre>
