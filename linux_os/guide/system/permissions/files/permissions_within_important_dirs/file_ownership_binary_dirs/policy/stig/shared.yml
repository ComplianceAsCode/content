    {{{ full_name }}} system commands must be owned by root.

vuldiscussion: |-
    If {{{ full_name }}} allowed any user to make changes to software libraries, then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a robust change management process.

    This requirement applies to {{{ full_name }}} with software libraries that are accessible and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages. Software libraries also include privileged programs that execute with escalated privileges.

checktext: |-
    Verify the system commands contained in the following directories are owned by "root" with the following command:

    $ sudo find -L /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin /usr/libexec /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin ! -user root -exec ls -l {} \;

    If any system commands are found to not be owned by root, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the system commands to be protected from unauthorized access.

    Run the following command, replacing "[FILE]" with any system command file not owned by "root".

    $ sudo chown root [FILE]
