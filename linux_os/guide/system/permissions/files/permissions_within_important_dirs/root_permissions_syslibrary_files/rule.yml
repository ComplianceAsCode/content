title: |-
    Verify the system-wide library files in directories
    "/lib", "/lib64", "/usr/lib/" and "/usr/lib64" are owned by root.

description: |-
    System-wide library files are stored in the following directories
    by default:
    <pre>/lib
    /lib64
    /usr/lib
    /usr/lib64
    </pre>
    All system-wide shared library files should be protected from unauthorised
    access. If any of these files is not owned by root, correct its owner with
    the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo chgrp root <i>FILE</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    If the operating system were to allow any user to make changes to software libraries,
    then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the appropriate testing and
    approvals that are part of a robust change management process.

    This requirement applies to operating systems with software libraries that are
    accessible and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages. Software libraries
    also include privileged programs which execute with escalated privileges. Only qualified
    and authorized individuals must be allowed to obtain access to information system components
    for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.

ocil_clause: 'system wide library files are not group owned by root'

ocil: |-
    System-wide library files are stored in the following directories:
    <pre>/lib
    /lib64
    /usr/lib
    /usr/lib64
    </pre>
    To find if system-wide library files stored in these directories are not group-owned by
    root run the following command for each directory <i>DIR</i>:
    <pre>$ sudo find -L <i>DIR</i> ! -group root -type f </pre>
