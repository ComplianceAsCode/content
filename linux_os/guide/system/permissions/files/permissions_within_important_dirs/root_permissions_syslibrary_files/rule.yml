title: |-
    Verify the system-wide library files in directories
    "/lib", "/lib64", "/usr/lib/" and "/usr/lib64" are owned by root.

description: |-
    System-wide library files are stored in the following directories
    by default:
    <pre>/lib
    /lib64
    /usr/lib
    /usr/lib64
    </pre>
    All system-wide shared library files should be protected from unauthorised
    access. If any of these files is not owned by root, correct its owner with
    the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo chgrp root <i>DIR</i></pre>

rationale: |-
  If the operating system were to allow any user to make changes to software libraries,
  then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the appropriate testing and
  approvals that are part of a robust change management process.

  This requirement applies to operating systems with software libraries that are
  accessible and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages. Software libraries
  also include privileged programs which execute with escalated privileges. Only qualified
  and authorized individuals must be allowed to obtain access to information system components
  for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.
