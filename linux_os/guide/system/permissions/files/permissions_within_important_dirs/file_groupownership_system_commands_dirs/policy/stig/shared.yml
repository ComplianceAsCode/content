    {{{ full_name }}} system commands must be group-owned by root or a system account.

    If {{{ full_name }}} allowed any user to make changes to software libraries, then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a robust change management process.

    This requirement applies to {{{ full_name }}} with software libraries that are accessible and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages. Software libraries also include privileged programs that execute with escalated privileges.

checktext: |-
    Verify the system commands contained in the following directories are group-owned by "root", or a required system account, with the following command:

    $ sudo find -L /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin ! -group root -exec ls -l {} \;

    If any system commands are returned and is not group-owned by a required system account, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the system commands to be protected from unauthorized access.

    Run the following command, replacing "[FILE]" with any system command file not group-owned by "root" or a required system account.

    $ sudo chgrp root [FILE]
