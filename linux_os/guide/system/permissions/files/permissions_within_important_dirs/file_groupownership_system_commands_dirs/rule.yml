title: 'Verify that system commands files are group owned by root or a system account'

description: |-
    System commands files are stored in the following directories by default:
    <pre>/bin
    /sbin
    /usr/bin
    /usr/sbin
    /usr/local/bin
    /usr/local/sbin
    </pre>
    All files in these directories should be owned by the <tt>root</tt> group,
    or a system account.
    If the directory, or any file in these directories, is found to be owned
    by a group other than root or a a system account correct its ownership
    with the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo chgrp root <i>FILE</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    If the operating system allows any user to make changes to software
    libraries, then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the
    appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a robust change management
    process.
    This requirement applies to operating systems with software libraries
    that are accessible and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages.
    Software libraries also include privileged programs which execute with
    escalated privileges. Only qualified and authorized individuals must be
    allowed to obtain access to information system components for purposes
    of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.

    $ sudo find -L /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin ! -group root -exec ls -l {} \;

fixtext: |-
