title: 'Verify File Permissions Within Some Important Directories'

description: |-
    Some directories contain files whose confidentiality or integrity
    is notably important and may also be susceptible to misconfiguration over time, particularly if
    unpackaged software is installed. As such,
    an argument exists to verify that files' permissions within these directories remain
    configured correctly and restrictively.
