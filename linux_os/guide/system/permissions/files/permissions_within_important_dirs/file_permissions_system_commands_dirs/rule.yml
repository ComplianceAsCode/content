title: 'Verify that system commands are protected from unauthorized access'

description: |-
    System commands are stored in the following directories by default:
    <pre>/bin
    /sbin
    /usr/bin
    /usr/sbin
    /usr/local/bin
    /usr/local/sbin</pre>
    All files in these directories should not be group-writable or world-writable.
    If any file <i>FILE</i> in these directories is found
    to be group-writable or world-writable, correct its permission with the
    following command:
    <pre>$ sudo chmod 755 <i>FILE</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    System binaries are executed by privileged users, as well as system services,
    and restrictive permissions are necessary to ensure execution of these programs
    cannot be co-opted.

ocil: |-
    System commands are stored in the following directories by default:
    <pre>/bin
    /sbin
    /usr/bin
    /usr/local/bin
    /usr/local/sbin
    /usr/sbin</pre>
    To find system commands that have mode 0755 or less permissive,
    run the following command for each directory <i>DIR</i> which contains system executables:
    <pre>$ sudo find -L <i>DIR</i> -perm /022 -type f</pre>
