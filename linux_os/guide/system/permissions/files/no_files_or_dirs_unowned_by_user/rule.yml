title: 'Ensure All Files And Directories Are Owned by a User'

description: |-
    If any files or directories are not owned by a user, then the cause of their lack of ownership should be
    investigated. Following this, the files should be deleted or assigned to an appropriate user.

    Locate the mount points related to local devices by the following command:
    <pre>$ findmnt -n -l -k -it $(awk '/nodev/ { print $2 }' /proc/filesystems | paste -sd,)</pre>

    For all mount points listed by the previous command, it is necessary to search for files and directories which
    do not belong to a valid user using the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo find <i>MOUNTPOINT</i> -xdev -nouser 2&gt;/dev/null</pre>

rationale: |-
    Unowned files and directories do not directly imply a security problem, but they are generally a sign that
    something is amiss. They may be caused by an intruder, by incorrect software installation or
    draft software removal, or by failure to remove all files belonging to a deleted account, or
    other similar cases. The files and directories should be repaired so they will not cause problems when
    accounts are created in the future, and the cause should be discovered and addressed.

ocil_clause: 'files exist that are not owned by a valid user'

ocil: |-
    The following command will locate the mount points related to local devices:
    <pre>$ findmnt -n -l -k -it $(awk '/nodev/ { print $2 }' /proc/filesystems | paste -sd,)</pre>

    The following command will show files and directories which do not belong to a valid user:
    <pre>$ sudo find <i>MOUNTPOINT</i> -xdev -nouser 2&gt;/dev/null</pre>

    Replace <i>MOUNTPOINT</i> by the mount points listed by the fist command.

    No files and directories without a valid user should be located.

fixtext: |-
    Either remove all files and directories from the system that do not have a valid user, or assign a valid user to all unowned files and directories on {{{ full_name }}} with the "chown" command:

    $ sudo chown [user] [file]

warnings:
    - functionality: |-
        For this rule to evaluate centralized user accounts, <tt>getent</tt> must be working properly
        so that running the command <pre>getent passwd</pre> returns a list of all users in your organization.
        If using the System Security Services Daemon (SSSD), <pre>enumerate = true</pre> must be configured
        in your organization's domain to return a complete list of users
    - general: |-
        This rule can take a long time to perform the check and might consume a considerable
        amount of resources depending on the number of files present on the system. It is not a
        problem in most cases, but especially systems with a large number of files can be affected.
