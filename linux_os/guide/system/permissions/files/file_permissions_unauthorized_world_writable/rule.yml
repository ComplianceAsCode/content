title: 'Ensure No World-Writable Files Exist'

description: |-
    It is generally a good idea to remove global (other) write
    access to a file when it is discovered. However, check with
    documentation for specific applications before making changes.
    Also, monitor for recurring world-writable files, as these may be
    symptoms of a misconfigured application or user account. Finally,
    this applies to real files and not virtual files that are a part of
    pseudo file systems such as <tt>sysfs</tt> or <tt>procfs</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Data in world-writable files can be modified by any
    user on the system. In almost all circumstances, files can be
    configured using a combination of user and group permissions to
    support whatever legitimate access is needed without the risk
    caused by world-writable files.
