title: 'File Permissions and Masks'

description: |-
    Traditional Unix security relies heavily on file and
    directory permissions to prevent unauthorized users from reading or
    modifying files to which they should not have access.
    <br /><br />
    Several of the commands in this section search filesystems
    for files or directories with certain characteristics, and are
    intended to be run on every local partition on a given system.
    When the variable <i>PART</i> appears in one of the commands below,
    it means that the command is intended to be run repeatedly, with the
    name of each local partition substituted for <i>PART</i> in turn.
    <br /><br />
    The following command prints a list of all xfs partitions on the local
    system, which is the default filesystem for {{{ full_name }}}
    installations:
    <pre>$ mount -t xfs | awk '{print $3}'</pre>
    For any systems that use a different
    local filesystem type, modify this command as appropriate.
