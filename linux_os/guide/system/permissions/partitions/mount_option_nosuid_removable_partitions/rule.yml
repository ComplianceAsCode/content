title: 'Add nosuid Option to Removable Media Partitions'

description: |-
    The <tt>nosuid</tt> mount option prevents set-user-identifier (SUID)
    and set-group-identifier (SGID) permissions from taking effect. These permissions
    allow users to execute binaries with the same permissions as the owner and group
    of the file respectively. Users should not be allowed to introduce SUID and SGID
    files into the system via partitions mounted from removeable media.
    {{{ describe_mount(option="nosuid", part="any removable media partitions") }}}

rationale: |-
    The presence of SUID and SGID executables should be tightly controlled. Allowing
    users to introduce SUID or SGID binaries from partitions mounted off of
    removable media would allow them to introduce their own highly-privileged programs.
