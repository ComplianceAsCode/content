title: 'Add noexec Option to Removable Media Partitions'

description: "The <tt>noexec</tt> mount option prevents the direct\nexecution of binaries on the mounted filesystem. \nPreventing the direct execution of binaries from removable media (such as a USB\nkey) provides a defense against malicious software that may be present on such\nuntrusted media.\n{{{ describe_mount(option="noexec", part="any removable media partitions") }}}"

rationale: |-
    Allowing users to execute binaries from removable media such as USB keys exposes
    the system to potential compromise.

ocil_clause: 'removable media partitions are present'

ocil: |-
    To verify that binaries cannot be directly executed from removable media, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep -v noexec /etc/fstab</pre>
    The resulting output will show partitions which do not have the <tt>noexec</tt> flag. Verify all partitions
    in the output are not removable media.
