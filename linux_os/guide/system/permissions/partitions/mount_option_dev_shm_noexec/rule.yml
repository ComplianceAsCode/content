title: 'Add noexec Option to /dev/shm'

description: |-
    The <tt>noexec</tt> mount option can be used to prevent binaries
    from being executed out of <tt>/dev/shm</tt>.
    It can be dangerous to allow the execution of binaries
    from world-writable temporary storage directories such as <tt>/dev/shm</tt>.
    {{{ describe_mount(option="noexec", part="/dev/shm") }}}

rationale: |-
    Allowing users to execute binaries from world-writable directories
    such as <tt>/dev/shm</tt> can expose the system to potential compromise.
