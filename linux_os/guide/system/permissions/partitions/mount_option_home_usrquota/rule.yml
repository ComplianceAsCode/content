title: 'Add usrquota Option to /home'

description: |-
    The <tt>usrquota</tt> mount option allows for the filesystem to have disk quotas configured.
    {{{ describe_mount(option="usrquota", part="/home") }}}

rationale: |-
    To ensure the availability of disk space on /home, it is important to limit the impact a
    single user or group can cause for other users (or the wider system) by intentionally or
    accidentally filling up the partition. Quotas can also be applied to inodes for filesystems
    where inode exhaustion is a concern.

warnings:
    - general: |-
        The quota options for XFS file systems can only be activated when mounting the partition.
        It is not possible to enable them by remounting an already mounted partition. Therefore,
        if the desired options were not defined before mounting the partition, dismount and mount
        it again to apply the quota options.

    - functionality: |-
        OVAL looks for partitions whose mount point is a substring of any interactive user's home
        directory and validates that usrquota option is there. Because of this, there could be
        false negatives when several partitions share a base substring. For example, if there is a
        home directory in <tt>/var/tmp/user1</tt> and there are partitions mounted in
        <tt>/var</tt> and <tt>/var/tmp</tt>. The usrquota option is only expected in
        <tt>/var/tmp</tt>, but OVAL will check both.<br/>
        Bash remediation uses the <tt>df</tt> command to find out the partition where the home
        directory is mounted. However, if the directory doesn't exist the remediation won't be
        applied.
