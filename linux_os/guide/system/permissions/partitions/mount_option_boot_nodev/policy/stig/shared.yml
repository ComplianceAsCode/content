    Verify that the "/boot" mount point has the "nodev" option is with the following command:

    Note: This control is not applicable to {{{ full_name }}} system booted UEFI.

    $ sudo mount | grep '\s/boot\s'

    /dev/sda1 on /boot type xfs (rw,nodev,relatime,seclabel,attr2)

    If the "/boot" file system does not have the "nodev" option set, this is a finding.
