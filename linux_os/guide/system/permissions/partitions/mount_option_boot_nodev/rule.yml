title: 'Add nodev Option to /boot'

description: |-
    The <tt>nodev</tt> mount option can be used to prevent device files from
    being created in <tt>/boot</tt>.
    Legitimate character and block devices should exist only in
    the <tt>/dev</tt> directory on the root partition or within chroot
    jails built for system services.
    {{{ describe_mount(option="nodev", part="/boot") }}}

rationale: |-
    The only legitimate location for device files is the <tt>/dev</tt> directory
    located on the root partition. The only exception to this is chroot jails.
