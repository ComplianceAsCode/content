title: 'Add noexec Option to /var/tmp'

description: |-
    The <tt>noexec</tt> mount option can be used to prevent binaries
    from being executed out of <tt>/var/tmp</tt>.
    {{{ describe_mount(option="noexec", part="/var/tmp") }}}

rationale: |-
    Allowing users to execute binaries from world-writable directories
    such as <tt>/var/tmp</tt> should never be necessary in normal operation and
    can expose the system to potential compromise.
