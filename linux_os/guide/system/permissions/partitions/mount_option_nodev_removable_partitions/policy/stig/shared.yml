    {{{ full_name }}} must prevent special devices on file systems that are used with removable media.

vuldiscussion: |-
    The only legitimate location for device files is the "/dev" directory
    located on the root partition. An exception to this is chroot jails, and it is
    not advised to set "nodev" on partitions which contain their root
    filesystems.

checktext: |-
    Verify file systems that are used for removable media are mounted with the "nodev" option with the following command:

    $ more /etc/fstab

    UUID=2bc871e4-e2a3-4f29-9ece-3be60c835222 /mnt/usbflash vfat noauto,owner,ro,nosuid,nodev,noexec 0 0

    If a file system found in "/etc/fstab" refers to removable media and it does not have the "nodev" option set, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the "/etc/fstab" to use the "nodev" option on file systems that are associated with removable media.

vuln_discussion: |-
    The "nodev" mount option causes the system not to interpret character or block special devices. Executing character or blocking special devices from untrusted file systems increases the opportunity for nonprivileged users to attain unauthorized administrative access.
