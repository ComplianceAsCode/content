title: 'Add nodev Option to Removable Media Partitions'

description: |-
    The <tt>nodev</tt> mount option prevents files from being
    interpreted as character or block devices.
    Legitimate character and block devices should exist only in
    the <tt>/dev</tt> directory on the root partition or within chroot
    jails built for system services.
    {{{ describe_mount(option="nodev", part="any removable media partitions") }}}

rationale: |-
    The only legitimate location for device files is the <tt>/dev</tt> directory
    located on the root partition. An exception to this is chroot jails, and it is
    not advised to set <tt>nodev</tt> on partitions which contain their root
    filesystems.
