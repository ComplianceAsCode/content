title: 'Value for hidepid option'

description: |-
    The hidepid mount option is applicable to /proc and is used to control who can access
    the information in /proc/[pid] directories. The option can have one of the following
    values:
    0: Everybody may access all /proc/[pid] directories.
    1: Users may not access files and subdirectories inside any /proc/[pid] directories
       but their own. The /proc/[pid] directories themselves remain visible.
    2: Same as for mode 1, but in addition the /proc/[pid] directories belonging to other
       users become invisible.
