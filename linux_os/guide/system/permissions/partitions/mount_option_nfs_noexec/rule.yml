title: 'Add noexec Option to any nfs mounts'

description: |-
    The <tt>noexec</tt> mount option can be used to prevent
    execution of programs in mounted file systems. This option must be used for
    mounting any file system not containing approved binary files as they may
    be incompatible.

rationale: |-
    Executing files from untrusted file systems increases the opportunity for
    unprivileged users to attain unauthorized administrative access.
