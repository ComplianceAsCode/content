title: 'Add nosuid Option to any nfs mounts'

description: |-
    The <tt>nosuid</tt> mount option can be used to prevent
    execution of setuid programs in network mounts. The SUID and SGID permissions
    should not be required in these user data directories.

rationale: |-
    The presence of SUID and SGID executables should be tightly controlled.
    This option must be used for mounting any file system not containing
    approved <tt>setuid</tt> and <tt>setguid</tt> files. Executing files from
    untrusted file systems increases the opportunity for unprivileged users to
    attain unauthorized administrative access.
