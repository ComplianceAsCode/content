title: 'Add noauto Option to /boot'

description: |-
    The <tt>noauto</tt> mount option is used to prevent automatic mounting of th
    <tt>/boot</tt> partition. 
    {{{ describe_mount(option="noauto", part="/boot") }}}

rationale: |-
    The <tt>/boot</tt> partition contains the kernel and the bootloader. Access
    to the partition after the boot process finishes should not be needed. Files
    contained within this partition can be analysed and gained information can
    be used for exploit creation.

warnings:
    - general: |-
        Although contents of the <tt>/boot</tt> partition should not be needed
        during normal system operation, they might need to be accessible during
        system maintenance and upgrades. Make sure that applying this rule will
        not break upgrade or maintenance processes affecting the system.
