title: 'Add nosuid Option to home directories'

description: |-
    The <tt>nosuid</tt> mount option can be used to prevent
    execution of setuid programs in home directories. The SUID and SGID permissions
    should not be required in these user data directories.

    Assuming home directories in <tt>/home</tt>, {{{ describe_mount(option="nosuid", part="/home") }}}

rationale: |-
    The presence of SUID and SGID executables should be tightly controlled. Users
    should not be able to execute SUID or SGID binaries from user home directory partitions.
