title: 'Bind Mount /var/tmp To /tmp'

description: "The <tt>/var/tmp</tt> directory is a world-writable directory.  \nBind-mount it to <tt>/tmp</tt> in order to consolidate temporary storage into\none location protected by the same techniques as <tt>/tmp</tt>.  To do so, edit\n<tt>/etc/fstab</tt> and add the following line:\n<pre>/tmp     /var/tmp     none     rw,nodev,noexec,nosuid,bind     0 0</pre>\nSee the <tt>mount(8)</tt> man page for further explanation of bind mounting."

rationale: |-
    Having multiple locations for temporary storage is not required. Unless absolutely
    necessary to meet requirements, the storage location <tt>/var/tmp</tt> should be bind mounted to
    <tt>/tmp</tt> and thus share the same protections.
