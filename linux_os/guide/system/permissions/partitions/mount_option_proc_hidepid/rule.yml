title: 'Add hidepid Option to /proc'

description: |-
    The <tt>hidepid</tt> mount option is applicable to <tt>/proc</tt> and is used to
    control who can access the information in <tt>/proc/[pid]</tt> directories.
    The option can have one of the following values:
    <pre>
    0: Everybody may access all /proc/[pid] directories.
    1: Users may not access files and subdirectories inside any /proc/[pid] directories
       but their own. The /proc/[pid] directories themselves remain visible.
    2: Same as for mode 1, but in addition the /proc/[pid] directories belonging to other
       users become invisible.
    </pre>
    For example, if you choose the value 2:
    {{{ describe_mount(option="hidepid=2", part="/proc") }}}

rationale: |-
    Users should not be able to see and access directories within /proc, which are not
    related to their own processes in a system. Otherwise, sensitive information from
    other users could be seem.

warnings:
    - functionality: |-
        Hiding the <tt>pid</tt> of processes may lead to problems with <tt>PolicyKit</tt> and <tt>D-Bus</tt>,
        it may also convey a false sense of security.
