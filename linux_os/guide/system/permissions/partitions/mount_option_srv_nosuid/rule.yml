title: 'Add nosuid Option to /srv'

description: |-
    The <tt>nosuid</tt> mount option can be used to prevent
    execution of setuid programs in <tt>/srv</tt>. The SUID and SGID permissions
    should not be required in this directory.
    {{{ describe_mount(option="nosuid", part="/srv") }}}

rationale: |-
    The presence of SUID and SGID executables should be tightly controlled. The
    <tt>/srv</tt> directory contains files served by various network services such as FTP. Users should
    not be able to execute SUID or SGID binaries from this directory.
