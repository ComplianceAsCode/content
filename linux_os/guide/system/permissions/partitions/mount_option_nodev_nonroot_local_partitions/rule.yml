title: 'Add nodev Option to Non-Root Local Partitions'

description: "The <tt>nodev</tt> mount option prevents files from being\ninterpreted as character or block devices. \nLegitimate character and block devices should exist only in\nthe <tt>/dev</tt> directory on the root partition or within chroot\njails built for system services.\n{{{ describe_mount(option="nodev", part="any non-root local partitions") }}}"

rationale: |-
    The <tt>nodev</tt> mount option prevents files from being
    interpreted as character or block devices. The only legitimate location
    for device files is the <tt>/dev</tt> directory located on the root partition.
    The only exception to this is chroot jails, for which it is not advised
    to set <tt>nodev</tt> on these filesystems.
