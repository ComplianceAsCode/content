title: 'Add noexec Option to /home'

description: |-
    The <tt>noexec</tt> mount option can be used to prevent binaries from being
    executed out of <tt>/home</tt>.
    {{{ describe_mount(option="noexec", part="/home") }}}

rationale: |-
    The <tt>/home</tt> directory contains data of individual users. Binaries in
    this directory should not be considered as trusted and users should not be
    able to execute them.

        OVAL looks for partitions whose mount point is a substring of any interactive user's home
        directory and validates that noexec option is there. Because of this, there could be false
        negatives when several partitions share a base substring. For example, if there is a home
        directory in <tt>/var/tmp/user1</tt> and there are partitions mounted in <tt>/var</tt> and
        <tt>/var/tmp</tt>. The noexec option is only expected in <tt>/var/tmp</tt>, but OVAL will
        check both.<br/>
        Bash remediation uses the <tt>df</tt> command to find out the partition where the home
        directory is mounted. However, if the directory doesn't exist the remediation won't be
        applied.
