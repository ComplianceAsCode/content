    {{{ full_name }}} must prevent code from being executed on file systems that contain user home directories.

vuldiscussion: |-
    The "noexec" mount option causes the system to not execute binary files. This option must be used for mounting any file system not containing approved binary files, as they may be incompatible. Executing files from untrusted file systems increases the opportunity for unprivileged users to attain unauthorized administrative access.

checktext: |-
    Verify "/home" is mounted with the "noexec" option with the following command:

    Note: If a separate file system has not been created for the user home directories (user home directories are mounted under "/"), this is automatically a finding as the "noexec" option cannot be used on the "/" system.

    $ mount | grep /home

    tmpfs on /home type xfs (rw,nodev,nosuid,noexec,seclabel)

    If the "/home" file system is mounted without the "noexec" option, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Modify "/etc/fstab" to use the "noexec" option on the "/home" directory.
