title: 'Ensure overlayfs kernel module is not available'

description: |-
    {{{ describe_module_disable(module="overlayfs") }}}
    overlayfs is a Linux filesystem that layers multiple filesystems to create a single
    unified view which allows a user to "merge" several mount points into a unified
    filesystem.

rationale: |-
    The overlayfs has known CVE's. Disabling the overlayfs reduces the local attack 
    surface by removing support for unnecessary filesystem types and mitigates potential
    risks associated with unauthorized execution of setuid files, enhancing the overall
    system security.

severity: low

platform: system_with_kernel
