title: 'Disable Booting from USB Devices in Boot Firmware'

description: |-
    Configure the system boot firmware (historically called BIOS on PC
    systems) to disallow booting from USB drives.

rationale: |-
    Booting a system from a USB device would allow an attacker to
    circumvent any security measures provided by the operating system. Attackers
    could mount partitions and modify the configuration of the OS.
