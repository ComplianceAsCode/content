    {{{ full_name }}} must restrict exposed kernel pointer addresses access.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Exposing kernel pointers (through procfs or "seq_printf()") exposes kernel writeable structures which may contain functions pointers. If a write vulnerability occurs in the kernel, allowing write access to any of this structure, the kernel can be compromised. This option disallow any program without the CAP_SYSLOG capability to get the addresses of kernel pointers by replacing them with 0.

checktext: |-
    Verify the runtime status of the kernel.kptr_restrict kernel parameter with the following command:

    $ sudo sysctl kernel.kptr_restrict

    kernel.kptr_restrict = 1

    Verify the configuration of the kernel.kptr_restrict kernel parameter with the following command:

    $ { /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysctl --cat-config; cat /etc/sysctl.conf; } | egrep -v '^(#|$)' | grep -F kernel.kptr_restrict | tail -1

    kernel.kptr_restrict =1

    If "kernel.kptr_restrict" is not set to "1" or is missing, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Add or edit the following line in a system configuration file in the "/etc/sysctl.d/" directory:

    kernel.kptr_restrict = 1

    Reload settings from all system configuration files with the following command:

    $ sudo sysctl --system
