title: 'Enable ExecShield via sysctl'

description: |-
    By default on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 64-bit systems, ExecShield is
    enabled and can only be disabled if the hardware does not support
    ExecShield or is disabled in <tt>/etc/default/grub</tt>. For Red Hat
    Enterprise Linux 7 32-bit systems, <tt>sysctl</tt> can be used to enable
    ExecShield.

rationale: |-
    ExecShield uses the segmentation feature on all x86 systems to prevent
    execution in memory higher than a certain address. It writes an address as
    a limit in the code segment descriptor, to control where code can be
    executed, on a per-process basis. When the kernel places a process's memory
    regions such as the stack and heap higher than this address, the hardware
    prevents execution in that address range. This is enabled by default on the
    latest Red Hat and Fedora systems if supported by the hardware.

ocil_clause: 'ExecShield is not supported by the hardware, is not enabled, or has been disabled by the kernel configuration.'

ocil: |-
    To verify ExecShield is enabled on 64-bit Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 systems,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ dmesg | grep '[NX|DX]*protection'</pre>
    The output should not contain <tt>'disabled by kernel command line option'</tt>.
    To verify that ExecShield has not been disabled in the kernel configuration,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep noexec /boot/grub2/grub.cfg</pre>
    The output should not return <tt>noexec=off</tt>.
    For 32-bit Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 systems, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sysctl kernel.exec-shield</pre>
    The output should be:
    {{{ describe_sysctl_option_value(sysctl="kernel.exec-shield", value="1") }}}
