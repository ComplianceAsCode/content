title: 'Enable ExecShield via sysctl'

description: |-
    By default on {{{ full_name }}} 64-bit systems, ExecShield is
    enabled and can only be disabled if the hardware does not support
    ExecShield or is disabled in <tt>/etc/default/grub</tt>.

    {{# products that are available also in a 32 bits form #}}
    {{% if "rhel" not in product and product != "fedora" %}}
    For {{{ full_name }}}  32-bit systems, <tt>sysctl</tt> can be used to enable
    ExecShield.
    {{% endif %}}

rationale: |-
    ExecShield uses the segmentation feature on all x86 systems to prevent
    execution in memory higher than a certain address. It writes an address as
    a limit in the code segment descriptor, to control where code can be
    executed, on a per-process basis. When the kernel places a process's memory
    regions such as the stack and heap higher than this address, the hardware
    prevents execution in that address range. This is enabled by default on the
    latest Red Hat and Fedora systems if supported by the hardware.

ocil: |-
    To verify ExecShield is enabled on 64-bit {{{ full_name }}} systems,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ dmesg | grep '[NX|DX]*protection'</pre>
    The output should not contain <tt>'disabled by kernel command line option'</tt>.
    {{{ ocil_grub2_argument("noexec=off") | indent(4) }}}

    {{# products that are available also in a 32 bits form #}}
    {{% if "rhel" not in product and product != "fedora" %}}
    For 32-bit {{{ full_name }}} systems, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sysctl kernel.exec-shield</pre>
    The output should be:
    {{{ describe_sysctl_option_value(sysctl="kernel.exec-shield", value="1") }}}

    On a 32-bit {{{ full_name }}} system, run the following command:

    Then, add or edit the following line in "/etc/sysctl.conf":

    Update the GRUB 2 bootloader configuration.
