    {{{ full_name }}} must implement non-executable data to protect its memory from unauthorized code execution.

vuldiscussion: |-
    ExecShield uses the segmentation feature on all x86 systems to prevent
    execution in memory higher than a certain address. It writes an address as
    a limit in the code segment descriptor, to control where code can be
    executed, on a per-process basis. When the kernel places a process's memory
    regions such as the stack and heap higher than this address, the hardware
    prevents execution in that address range. This is enabled by default on the
    latest Red Hat and Fedora systems if supported by the hardware.

    Verify ExecShield is enabled on 64-bit {{{ full_name }}} systems with the following command:

     $ dmesg | grep '[NX|DX]*protection'

    [ 0.000000] NX (Execute Disable) protection: active


    If "dmesg" does not show "NX (Execute Disable) protection" active, this is a finding.

    Update the GRUB 2 bootloader configuration.

    Run the following command:

    $ sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --remove-args=noexec
