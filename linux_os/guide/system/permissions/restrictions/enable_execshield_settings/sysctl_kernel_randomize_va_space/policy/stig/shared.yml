    {{{ full_name }}} must implement address space layout randomization (ASLR) to protect its memory from unauthorized code execution.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Address space layout randomization (ASLR) makes it more difficult for an attacker to predict the location of attack code they have introduced into a
    process's address space during an attempt at exploitation. Additionally, ASLR makes it more difficult for an attacker to know the location of
    existing code in order to re-purpose it using return oriented programming (ROP) techniques.

checktext: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} is implementing ASLR with the following command:

    $ sysctl kernel.randomize_va_space

    kernel.randomize_va_space = 2

    Check that the configuration files are present to enable this kernel parameter.
    Verify the configuration of the kernel.kptr_restrict kernel parameter with the following command:

    $ sudo /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysctl --cat-config | egrep -v '^(#|;)' |  grep -F kernel.randomize_va_space | tail -1

    kernel.randomize_va_space = 2

    If "kernel.randomize_va_space" is not set to "2" or is missing, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Add or edit the following line in a system configuration file in the "/etc/sysctl.d/" directory:

    kernel.randomize_va_space = 2

    Reload settings from all system configuration files with the following command:

    $ sudo sysctl --system
