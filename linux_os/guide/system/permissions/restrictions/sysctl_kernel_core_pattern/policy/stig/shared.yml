    {{{ full_name }}} must disable the kernel.core_pattern.

vuldiscussion: |-
    A core dump includes a memory image taken at the time the operating system
    terminates an application. The memory image could contain sensitive data
    and is generally useful only for developers trying to debug problems.

checktext: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} disables storing core dumps with the following commands:

    $ sysctl kernel.core_pattern

    kernel.core_pattern = |/bin/false

    If the returned line does not have a value of "|/bin/false", or a line is not returned and the need for core dumps is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, this is a finding.

    Check that the configuration files are present to disable core dump storage.

    $ sudo /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysctl --cat-config | egrep -v '^(#|;)' | grep -F kernel.core_pattern | tail -1

    kernel.core_pattern = |/bin/false

    If "kernel.core_pattern" is not set to "|/bin/false" and is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, or is missing, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to disable storing core dumps.

    Add or edit the following line in a system configuration file, in the "/etc/sysctl.d/" directory:

    kernel.core_pattern = |/bin/false

    The system configuration files need to be reloaded for the changes to take effect. To reload the contents of the files, run the following command:

    $ sudo sysctl --system
