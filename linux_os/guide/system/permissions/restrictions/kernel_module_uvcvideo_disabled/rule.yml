title: 'Disable the uvcvideo module'

description: |-
    If the device contains a camera it should be covered or disabled when not in use.

rationale: |-
    Failing to disconnect from collaborative computing devices (i.e., cameras) can result in subsequent compromises of organizational information.
    Providing easy methods to physically disconnect from such devices after a collaborative computing session helps to ensure participants actually carry out the disconnect activity without having to go through complex and tedious procedures.

ocil_clause: 'the command does not return any output, or the line is commented out, and the collaborative computing device has not been authorized for use'

ocil: |-
    If the device or {{{ full_name }}} does not have a camera installed, this requirement is not applicable.

    This requirement is not applicable to mobile devices (smartphones and tablets), where the use of the camera is a local AO decision.

    This requirement is not applicable to dedicated VTC suites located in approved VTC locations that are centrally managed.

    For an external camera, if there is not a method for the operator to manually disconnect the camera at the end of collaborative computing sessions, this is a finding.

    For a built-in camera, the camera must be protected by a camera cover (e.g., laptop camera cover slide) when not in use. If the built-in camera is not protected with a camera cover, or is not physically disabled, this is a finding.

    If the camera is not disconnected, covered, or physically disabled, determine if it is being disabled via software with the following commands:

    Verify the operating system disables the ability to load the uvcvideo kernel module.

    $ sudo grep -r uvcvideo /etc/modprobe.d/* | grep "/bin/true"

    install uvcvideo /bin/true

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to disable the built-in or attached camera when not in use.

    Build or modify the "/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf" file by using the following example:

    install uvcvideo /bin/true
    blacklist uvcvideo

    Reboot the system for the settings to take effect.
