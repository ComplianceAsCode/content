title: 'Restrict Programs from Dangerous Execution Patterns'

description: |-
    The recommendations in this section are designed to
    ensure that the system's features to protect against potentially
    dangerous program execution are activated.
    These protections are applied at the system initialization or
    kernel level, and defend against certain types of badly-configured
    or compromised programs.
