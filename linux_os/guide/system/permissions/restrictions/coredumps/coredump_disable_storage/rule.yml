title: 'Disable storing core dump'

description: |-
    The <tt>Storage</tt> option in <tt>[Coredump]</tt> section
    of <tt>/etc/systemd/coredump.conf</tt>
    can be set to <tt>none</tt> to disable storing core dumps permanently.

rationale: |-
    A core dump includes a memory image taken at the time the operating system
    terminates an application. The memory image could contain sensitive data
    and is generally useful only for developers or system operators trying to
    debug problems. Enabling core dumps on production systems is not recommended,
    however there may be overriding operational requirements to enable advanced
    debuging. Permitting temporary enablement of core dumps during such situations
    should be reviewed through local needs and policy.

    To verify that storing core dumps are disabled, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep Storage /etc/systemd/coredump.conf</pre>
    The output should be:
    <pre>Storage=none</pre>

warnings:
    - general: |-
        If the <tt>/etc/systemd/coredump.conf</tt> file
        does not already contain the <tt>[Coredump]</tt> section,
        the value will not be configured correctly.
