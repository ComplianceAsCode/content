title: 'Disable storing core dump'

description: |-
    The <tt>Storage</tt> option in <tt>/etc/systemd/coredump.conf</tt>
    can be set to <tt>none</tt> to disable storing core dumps permanently.

rationale: |-
    A core dump includes a memory image taken at the time the operating system
    terminates an application. The memory image could contain sensitive data
    and is generally useful only for developers trying to debug problems.

    <pre>Storage=none</pre>
