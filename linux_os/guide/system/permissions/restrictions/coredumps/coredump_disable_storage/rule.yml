title: 'Disable storing core dump'

description: |-
    The <tt>Storage</tt> option in <tt>[Coredump]</tt> section
    of <tt>/etc/systemd/coredump.conf</tt>
    can be set to <tt>none</tt> to disable storing core dumps permanently.

rationale: |-
    A core dump includes a memory image taken at the time the operating system
    terminates an application. The memory image could contain sensitive data
    and is generally useful only for developers trying to debug problems.

severity: unknown

    ospp: FMT_SMF_EXT.1

ocil_clause: Storage is not set to none

ocil: |-
    To verify that storing core dumps are disabled, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep Storage /etc/systemd/coredump.conf</pre>
    The output should be:
    <pre>Storage=none</pre>

warnings:
    - general: |-
        If the <tt>/etc/systemd/coredump.conf</tt> file
        does not already contain the <tt>[Coredump]</tt> section,
        the value will not be configured correctly.
