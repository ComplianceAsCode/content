title: 'Disable Core Dumps'

description: |-
    A core dump file is the memory image of an executable
    program when it was terminated by the operating system due to
    errant behavior. In most cases, only software developers
    legitimately need to access these files. The core dump files may
    also contain sensitive information, or unnecessarily occupy large
    amounts of disk space.
    <br /><br />
    Once a hard limit is set in <tt>/etc/security/limits.conf</tt>, a
    user cannot increase that limit within his or her own session. If access
    to core dumps is required, consider restricting them to only
    certain users or groups. See the <tt>limits.conf</tt> man page for more
    information.
    <br /><br />
    The core dumps of setuid programs are further protected. The
    <tt>sysctl</tt> variable <tt>fs.suid_dumpable</tt> controls whether
    the kernel allows core dumps from these programs at all. The default
    value of 0 is recommended.
