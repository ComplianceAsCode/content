title: 'Disable Core Dumps for All Users'

description: |-
    To disable core dumps for all users, add the following line to
    <tt>/etc/security/limits.conf</tt>, or to a file within the
    <tt>/etc/security/limits.d/</tt> directory:
    <pre>*     hard   core    0</pre>

rationale: |-
    A core dump includes a memory image taken at the time the operating system
    terminates an application. The memory image could contain sensitive data and is generally useful
    only for developers trying to debug problems.
