title: 'Disable acquiring, saving, and processing core dumps'

description: |-
    The <tt>systemd-coredump.socket</tt> unit is a socket activation of
    the <tt>systemd-coredump@.service</tt> which processes core dumps.
    By masking the unit, core dump processing is disabled.

rationale: |-
    A core dump includes a memory image taken at the time the operating system
    terminates an application. The memory image could contain sensitive data
    and is generally useful only for developers trying to debug problems.

severity: medium

platform: machine

ocil_clause: unit systemd-coredump.socket is not masked or running

ocil: |-
    To verify that acquiring, saving, and processing core dumps is disabled, run the
    following command:
    <pre>$ systemctl status systemd-coredump.socket</pre>
    The output should be similar to:
    <pre>● systemd-coredump.socket
       Loaded: masked (Reason: Unit systemd-coredump.socket is masked.)
       Active: inactive (dead) ...
    </pre>
