    {{{ full_name }}} must disable acquiring, saving, and processing core dumps.

vuldiscussion: |-
    A core dump includes a memory image taken at the time the operating system
    terminates an application. The memory image could contain sensitive data
    and is generally useful only for developers trying to debug problems.

checktext: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} is not configured to acquire, save, or process core dumps with the following command:

    $ sudo systemctl status systemd-coredump.socket

    systemd-coredump.socket
    Loaded: masked (Reason: Unit systemd-coredump.socket is masked.)
    Active: inactive (dead)

    If the "systemd-coredump.socket" is loaded and not masked and the need for core dumps is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the system to disable the systemd-coredump.socket with the following command:

    $ sudo systemctl mask --now systemd-coredump.socket

    Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/systemd-coredump.socket -> /dev/null

    Reload the daemon for this change to take effect.

    $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
