title: 'Disable core dump backtraces'

description: |-
    The <tt>ProcessSizeMax</tt> option in <tt>[Coredump]</tt> section
    of <tt>/etc/systemd/coredump.conf</tt>
    specifies the maximum size in bytes of a core which will be processed.
    Core dumps exceeding this size may be stored, but the backtrace will not
    be generated.

rationale: |-
    A core dump includes a memory image taken at the time the operating system
    terminates an application. The memory image could contain sensitive data
    and is generally useful only for developers or system operators trying to
    debug problems.

    Enabling core dumps on production systems is not recommended,
    however there may be overriding operational requirements to enable advanced
    debuging. Permitting temporary enablement of core dumps during such situations
    should be reviewed through local needs and policy.

ocil_clause: ProcessSizeMax is not set to zero

ocil: |-
    To verify that logging core dump backtraces is disabled, run the
    following command:
    <pre>$ grep ProcessSizeMax /etc/systemd/coredump.conf</pre>
    The output should be:
    <pre>ProcessSizeMax=0</pre>

warnings:
    - general: |-
        If the <tt>/etc/systemd/coredump.conf</tt> file
        does not already contain the <tt>[Coredump]</tt> section,
        the value will not be configured correctly.
