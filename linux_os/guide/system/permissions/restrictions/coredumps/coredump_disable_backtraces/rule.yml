title: 'Disable core dump backtraces'

description: |-
    The <tt>ProcessSizeMax</tt> option in <tt>[Coredump]</tt> section
    of <tt>/etc/systemd/coredump.conf</tt>
    specifies the maximum size in bytes of a core which will be processed.
    Core dumps exceeding this size may be stored, but the backtrace will not
    be generated.

rationale: |-
    A core dump includes a memory image taken at the time the operating system
    terminates an application. The memory image could contain sensitive data
    and is generally useful only for developers or system operators trying to
    debug problems.

    Enabling core dumps on production systems is not recommended,
    however there may be overriding operational requirements to enable advanced
    debuging. Permitting temporary enablement of core dumps during such situations
    should be reviewed through local needs and policy.

ocil_clause: 'the "ProcessSizeMax" item is missing, commented out, or the value is anything other than "0" and the need for core dumps is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement for all domains that have the "core" item assigned'

ocil: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} disables core dump backtraces by issuing the following command:

    <pre>$ grep -i process /etc/systemd/coredump.conf

    ProcessSizeMax=0</pre>

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to disable core dump backtraces.

    Add or modify the following line in /etc/systemd/coredump.conf:

    ProcessSizeMax=0

srg_requirement: '{{{ full_name }}} must disable core dump backtraces.'

warnings:
    - general: |-
        If the <tt>/etc/systemd/coredump.conf</tt> file
        does not already contain the <tt>[Coredump]</tt> section,
        the value will not be configured correctly.
