srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must disable access to network bpf system call from nonprivileged processes.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Loading and accessing the packet filters programs and maps using the bpf() system call has the potential of revealing sensitive information about the kernel state.



checktext: |-
    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} prevents privilege escalation through the kernel by disabling access to the bpf system call with the following commands:

    $ sudo sysctl kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled

    kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled = 1

    If the returned line does not have a value of "1", or a line is not returned, this is a finding.

    Check that the configuration files are present to enable this kernel parameter.

    $ sudo /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysctl --cat-config | egrep -v '^(#|;)' | grep -F kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled | tail -1
    kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled = 1

    If the network parameter "kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled" is not equal to "1", or nothing is returned, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to prevent privilege escalation thru the kernel by disabling access to the bpf syscall by adding the following line to a file, in the "/etc/sysctl.d" directory:

    kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled = 1

    The system configuration files need to be reloaded for the changes to take effect. To reload the contents of the files, run the following command:

    $ sudo sysctl --system
