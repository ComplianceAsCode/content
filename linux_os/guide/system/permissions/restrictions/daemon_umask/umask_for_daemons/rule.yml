title: 'Set Daemon Umask'

description: |-
    The file <tt>/etc/init.d/functions</tt> includes initialization
    parameters for most or all daemons started at boot time.  The default umask of
    022 prevents creation of group- or world-writable files.  To set the default
    umask for daemons, edit the following line, inserting 022 or 027 for
    <i>UMASK</i> appropriately:
    <pre>umask <i><sub idref="var_umask_for_daemons" /></i></pre>
    Setting the umask to too restrictive a setting can cause serious errors at
    runtime.  Many daemons on the system already individually restrict themselves to
    a umask of 077 in their own init scripts.

rationale: |-
    The umask influences the permissions assigned to files created by a
    process at run time.  An unnecessarily permissive umask could result in files
    being created with insecure permissions.

ocil: |-
    To check the value of the <tt>umask</tt>, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep umask /etc/init.d/functions</pre>
    The output should show either <tt>022</tt> or <tt>027</tt>.
