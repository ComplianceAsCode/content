    {{{ full_name }}} must enable hardening for the Berkeley Packet Filter Just-in-time compiler.

vuldiscussion: |-
    When hardened, the extended Berkeley Packet Filter just-in-time compiler
    will randomize any kernel addresses in the BPF programs and maps,
    and will not expose the JIT addresses in "/proc/kallsyms".

checktext: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} enables hardening for the BPF JIT with the following commands:

    $ sudo sysctl net.core.bpf_jit_harden

    net.core.bpf_jit_harden = 2

    If the returned line does not have a value of "2", or a line is not returned, this is a finding.

    Check that the configuration files are present to enable this kernel parameter.

    $ sudo /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysctl --cat-config | egrep -v '^(#|;)' | grep -F net.core.bpf_jit_harden | tail -1
    net.core.bpf_jit_harden = 2

    If the network parameter "net.core.bpf_jit_harden" is not equal to "2" or nothing is returned, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to enable hardening for the BPF JIT compiler by adding the following line to a file, in the "/etc/sysctl.d" directory:

    net.core.bpf_jit_harden = 2

    The system configuration files need to be reloaded for the changes to take effect. To reload the contents of the files, run the following command:

    $ sudo sysctl --system
