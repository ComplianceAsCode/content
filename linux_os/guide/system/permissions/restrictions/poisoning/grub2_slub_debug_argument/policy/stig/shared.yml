    {{{ full_name }}} must clear SLUB/SLAB objects to prevent use-after-free attacks.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Poisoning writes an arbitrary value to freed objects, so any modification or
    reference to that object after being freed or before being initialized will be
    detected and prevented.
    This prevents many types of use-after-free vulnerabilities at little performance cost.
    Also prevents leak of data and detection of corrupted memory.

    Verify that GRUB 2 is configured to enable poisoning of SLUB/SLAB objects to mitigate use-after-free vulnerabilities with the following commands:

    Check that the current GRUB 2 configuration has poisoning of SLUB/SLAB objects enabled:

    $  sudo grubby --info=ALL | grep args | grep -v 'slub_debug=P'
    If any output is returned, this is a finding.

    Check that poisoning of SLUB/SLAB objects is enabled by default to persist in kernel updates:

    $ sudo grep slub_debug /etc/default/grub

    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="slub_debug=P"

    If "slub_debug" is not set to "P", is missing or commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure RHEL  to enable poisoning of SLUB/SLAB objects with the following commands:

    $ sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args="slub_debug=P"

    Add or modify the following line in "/etc/default/grub" to ensure the configuration survives kernel updates:

    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="slub_debug=P"
