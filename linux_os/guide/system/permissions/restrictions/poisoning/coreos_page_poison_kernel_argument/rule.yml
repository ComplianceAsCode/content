title: 'Enable page allocator poisoning'

description: |-
    To enable poisoning of free pages, add the argument <tt>page_poison=1</tt> to all
    BLS (Boot Loader Specification) entries ('options' line) for the Linux
    operating system in <tt>/boot/loader/entries/*.conf</tt>.


rationale: |-
    Poisoning writes an arbitrary value to freed pages, so any modification or
    reference to that page after being freed or before being initialized will be
    detected and prevented.
    This prevents many types of use-after-free vulnerabilities at little performance cost.
    Also prevents leak of data and detection of corrupted memory.

ocil_clause: 'page allocator poisoning is not enabled'

ocil: |-
    Inspect the form of all the BLS (Boot Loader Specification) entries
    ('options' line) in <tt>/boot/loader/entries/*.conf</tt>. If they include
    <tt>page_poison=1</tt>, then page poisoning is enabled at boot time.
    <br /><br />
    To ensure <tt>page_poison=1</tt> is configured on the installed kernel, add
    the kernel argument via a <pre>MachineConfig</pre> object to the appropriate
    pools.
