title: 'Disable the use of user namespaces'

description: |-
    {{{ describe_sysctl_option_value(sysctl="user.max_user_namespaces", value="0") }}}
    When containers are deployed on the machine, the value should be set
    to large non-zero value.

rationale: |-
    It is detrimental for operating systems to provide, or install by default, functionality exceeding requirements or system objectives.
    These unnecessary capabilities or services are often overlooked and therefore may remain unsecured.
    They increase the risk to the platform by providing additional attack vectors.
    User namespaces are used primarily for Linux containers. The value 0
    disallows the use of user namespaces.

warnings:
    - general: |-
       This configuration baseline was created to deploy the base operating system for general purpose
       workloads. When the operating system is configured for certain purposes, such as to host Linux Containers,
       it is expected that <tt>user.max_user_namespaces</tt> will be enabled.
        Note that this rule deliberately does not have remediations attached.
       Use the <tt>sysctl_user_max_user_namespaces</tt> if you want to utilize remediation for this rule.

    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} disables the use of user namespaces with the following commands:

    Note: User namespaces are used primarily for Linux containers. If containers are in use, this requirement is not applicable.

    {{{ ocil_sysctl_option_value(sysctl="user.max_user_namespaces", value="0") }}}

ocil_clause: "the correct value is not returned"

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to disable the use of user namespace.

    Note: User namespaces are used primarily for Linux containers. If containers are in use, this requirement is not applicable.
