srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must disable the use of user namespaces.

vuldiscussion: |-
    User namespaces are used primarily for Linux containers. The value 0
    disallows the use of user namespaces.

    Verify {{{ full_name }}} disables the use of user namespaces with the following commands:

    Note: User namespaces are used primarily for Linux containers. If containers are in use, this requirement is not applicable.

    $ sysctl user.max_user_namespaces

    user.max_user_namespaces = 0

    If the returned line does not have a value of "0", or a line is not returned, this is a finding.

    Check that the configuration files are present to enable this kernel parameter.

    $ sudo /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysctl --cat-config | egrep -v '^(#|;)' | grep -F user.max_user_namespaces | tail -1
    user.max_user_namespaces = 0

    If the network parameter "user.max_user_namespaces" is not equal to "0" or nothing is returned, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to disable the use of user namespaces by adding the following line to a file, in the "/etc/sysctl.d" directory:

    Note: User namespaces are used primarily for Linux containers. If containers are in use, this requirement is not applicable.

    user.max_user_namespaces = 0

    The system configuration files need to be reloaded for the changes to take effect. To reload the contents of the files, run the following command:

    $ sudo sysctl --system
