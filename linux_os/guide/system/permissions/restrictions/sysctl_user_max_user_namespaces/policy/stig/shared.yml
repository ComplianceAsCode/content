    Verify {{{ full_name }}} disables the use of user namespaces with the following commands:

    Note: User namespaces are used primarily for Linux containers. If containers are in use, this requirement is not applicable.

    $ sudo sysctl user.max_user_namespaces

    user.max_user_namespaces = 0

    If the returned line does not have a value of "0", or a line is not returned, this is a finding.

    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to disable the use of user namespaces by adding the following line to a file, in the "/etc/sysctl.d" directory:

    Note: User namespaces are used primarily for Linux containers. If containers are in use, this requirement is not applicable.

    user.max_user_namespaces = 0

    The system configuration files need to be reloaded for the changes to take effect. To reload the contents of the files, run the following command:

    $ sudo sysctl --system
