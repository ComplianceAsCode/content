title: 'Disable loading and unloading of kernel modules'

description: '{{{ describe_sysctl_option_value(sysctl="kernel.modules_disabled", value="1") }}}'

rationale: |-
    Malicious kernel modules can have a significant impact on system security and
    availability. Disabling loading of kernel modules prevents this threat. Note
    that once this option has been set, it cannot be reverted without doing a
    system reboot. Make sure that all needed kernel modules are loaded before
    setting this option.
