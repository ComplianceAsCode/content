title: 'Enable NX or XD Support in the BIOS'

description: |-
    Reboot the system and enter the BIOS or Setup configuration menu.
    Navigate the BIOS configuration menu and make sure that the option is enabled. The setting may be located
    under a Security section. Look for Execute Disable (XD) on Intel-based systems and No Execute (NX)
    on AMD-based systems.

rationale: |-
    Computers with the ability to prevent this type of code execution frequently put an option in the BIOS that will
    allow users to turn the feature on or off at will.
