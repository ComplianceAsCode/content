    {{{ full_name }}} Must Implement Non-Executable Data To Protect Its Memory From Unauthorized Code Execution.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Computers with the ability to prevent this type of code execution frequently put an option in the BIOS that will
    allow users to turn the feature on or off at will.

    Verify the NX (no-execution) bit flag is set on the system.

    Check that the no-execution bit flag is set with the following commands:

    $ sudo dmesg | grep NX

    [ 0.000000] NX (Execute Disable) protection: active

    If "dmesg" does not show "NX (Execute Disable) protection" active, check the cpuinfo settings with the following command:

    $ sudo grep flags /proc/cpuinfo
    flags : fpu vme de pse tsc ms nx rdtscp lm constant_ts

    The output should contain the "nx" flag.

    Then, verify that there are no log messsages stating that NX is disabled in the system log. Run the following command:
    $ sudo grep -P "^.+protection: disabled.+" /var/log/dmesg
    The output should be empty.

    Then, check that NX is not disabled in the kernel command line.
    $ sudo grep -P ".+noexec[0-9]*=off.+" /proc/cmdline
    The output should be empty.

    If NX is disabled, then this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    The NX bit execute protection must be enabled in the system BIOS.
