title: 'Install PAE Kernel on Supported 32-bit x86 Systems'

description: |-
    Systems that are using the 64-bit x86 kernel package
    do not need to install the kernel-PAE package because the 64-bit
    x86 kernel already includes this support. However, if the system is
    32-bit and also supports the PAE and NX features as
    determined in the previous section, the kernel-PAE package should
    be installed to enable XD or NX support.
    {{{ describe_package_install(package="kernel-PAE") }}}
    The installation process should also have configured the
    bootloader to load the new kernel at boot. Verify this after reboot
    and modify <tt>/etc/default/grub</tt> if necessary.

rationale: |-
    On 32-bit systems that support the XD or NX bit, the vendor-supplied
    PAE kernel is required to enable either Execute Disable (XD) or No Execute (NX) support.

        The kernel-PAE package should not be
        installed on older systems that do not support the XD or NX bit, as
        8this may prevent them from booting.8
