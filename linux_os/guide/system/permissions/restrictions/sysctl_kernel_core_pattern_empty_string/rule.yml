title: 'Disable storing core dumps'

description: |-
    The <tt>kernel.core_pattern</tt> option specifies the core dumpfile pattern
    name. It can be set to an empty string. In this case, the kernel
    behaves differently based on another related option. If
    <tt>kernel.core_uses_pid</tt> is set to <tt>1</tt>, then a file named as
    <tt>.PID</tt> (where <tt>PID</tt> is process ID of the crashed process) is
    created in the working directory. If <tt>kernel.core_uses_pid</tt> is set to
    <tt>0</tt>, no coredump is saved.
    {{{ describe_sysctl_option_value(sysctl="kernel.core_pattern", value="") }}}

rationale: |-
    A core dump includes a memory image taken at the time the operating system
    terminates an application. The memory image could contain sensitive data and is generally useful
    only for developers trying to debug problems.

    The runtime status of the <code>kernel.core_pattern</code> kernel parameter can be queried
    by running the following command:
    <pre>$ sysctl kernel.core_pattern | cat -A</pre>
    <code>kernel.core_pattern = $</code>
