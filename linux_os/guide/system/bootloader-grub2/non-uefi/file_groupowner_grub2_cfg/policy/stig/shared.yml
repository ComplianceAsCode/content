srg_requirement: |-
    The {{{ full_name }}} /boot/grub2/grub.cfg file must be group-owned by root.

vuldiscussion: |-
    The "root" group is a highly-privileged group. Furthermore, the group-owner of this
    file should not have any access privileges anyway.

checktext: |-
    To check the group ownership of /boot/grub2/grub.cfg ,
    run the command:
     $ sudo stat -c "%G %n" /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
    If properly configured, the output should indicate the following group-owner:
     root /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

    If /boot/grub2/grub.cfg does not have a group owner of root, then this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Change the group of the file /boot/grub2/grub.cfg to root by running the following command:
    $ sudo chgrp root /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
