title: 'Set Boot Loader Password in grub2 - systems prior to version 7.2'

description: |-
    The grub2 boot loader should have a superuser account and password
    protection enabled to protect boot-time settings.
    <br /><br />
    Since plaintext passwords are a security risk, generate an encrypted grub2 password
    for the grub superusers with the following command:
    <pre>$ grub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2</pre>
    When prompted, enter the password that was selected.
    <br /><br />
    Using the hash from the output, modify the <tt>/etc/grub.d/40_custom</tt>
    file with the following content:
    <pre>set superusers="root"
    password_pbkdf2 root grub.pbkdf2.sha512.VeryLongString
    </pre>
    Once the superuser password has been added, update the
    <tt>grub.cfg</tt> file by running:
    <pre>grub2-mkconfig -o {{{ grub2_boot_path }}}/grub.cfg</pre>

rationale: |-
    Password protection on the boot loader configuration ensures
    users with physical access cannot trivially alter
    important bootloader settings. These include which kernel to use,
    and whether to enter single-user mode.

ocil_clause: 'it does not'

ocil: |-
    To verify the boot loader superuser password has been set, run the following
    command:
    <pre># grep -i ^password_pbkdf2 {{{ grub2_boot_path }}}/grub.cfg</pre>
    The output should show the following:
    <pre>password_pbkdf2 <b>superusers-account</b> <b>${GRUB2_PASSWORD}</b></pre>

warnings:
    - general: |-
        To prevent hard-coded passwords, automatic remediation of this control is not available. Remediation
        must be automated as a component of machine provisioning, or followed manually as outlined above.

        Also, do NOT manually add the superuser account and password to the
        <tt>grub.cfg</tt> file as the grub2-mkconfig command overwrites this file.
