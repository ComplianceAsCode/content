    {{{ full_name }}} must require a unique superusers name upon booting into single-user and maintenance modes.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Having a nondefault grub superuser username makes password-guessing attacks less effective.

checktext: |-
    Verify the boot loader superuser account has been set with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -A1 "superusers" /etc/grub2.cfg

    set superusers="&lt;accountname&gt;"
    export superusers
    password_pbkdf2 &lt;accountname&gt; ${GRUB2_PASSWORD}

    Verify &lt;accountname&gt; is not a common name such as root, admin, or administrator.

    If superusers contains easily guessable usernames, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to have a unique username for the grub superuser account.

    Edit the "/etc/grub.d/01_users" file and add or modify the following lines with a nondefault username for the superuser account:

    set superusers="&lt;accountname&gt;"
    export superusers

    Once the superuser account has been added, update the grub.cfg file by running:

    Regenerate the GRUB configuration:

    $ sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

    Reboot the system:
    $ sudo reboot
