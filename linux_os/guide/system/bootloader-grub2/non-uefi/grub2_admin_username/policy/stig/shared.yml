    {{{ full_name }}} must require a unique superusers name upon booting into single-user and maintenance modes.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Having a non-default grub superuser username makes password-guessing attacks less effective.

checktext: |-
    Verify the boot loader superuser account has been set with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -A1 "superusers" /etc/grub2.cfg

     set superusers="&ltsuperusers-account&gt"
    export superusers

    The &ltsuperusers-account&gt is the actual account name different from common names like root,
    admin, or administrator.

    If superusers contains easily guessable usernames, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to have a unique username for the grub superuser account.

    Edit the "/etc/grub.d/01_users" file and add or modify the following lines inthe "### BEGIN /etc/grub.d/01_users ###" section:

    set superusers="superusers-account"
    export superusers

    Once the superuser account has been added, update the grub.cfg file by running:

    $ sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL'
