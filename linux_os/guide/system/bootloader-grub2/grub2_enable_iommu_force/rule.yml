title: 'IOMMU configuration directive'

description: |-
    On x86 architecture supporting VT-d, the IOMMU manages the access control policy between the hardware devices and some
        of the system critical units such as the memory.

rationale: |-
    On x86 architectures, activating the I/OMMU prevents the system from arbritrary accesses potentially made by
        hardware devices.
