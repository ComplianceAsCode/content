title: 'Set the UEFI Boot Loader Password'

description: |-
    The grub2 boot loader should have a superuser account and password
    protection enabled to protect boot-time settings.
    <br /><br />
    To do so, select a superuser account name and password and and modify the
    <tt>/etc/grub.d/01_users</tt> configuration file with the new account name.
    <br /><br />
    Since plaintext passwords are a security risk, generate a hash for the pasword
    by running the following command:
    <pre>$ grub2-setpassword</pre>
    When prompted, enter the password that was selected.
    <br /><br />
    NOTE: It is recommended not to use common administrator account names like root,
    admin, or administrator for the grub2 superuser account.
    <br /><br />
    Change the superuser to a different username (The default is 'root').
    <pre>$ sed -i s/root/bootuser/g /etc/grub.d/01_users</pre>
    <br /><br />
    To meet FISMA Moderate, the bootloader superuser account and password MUST
    differ from the root account and password.
    Once the superuser account and password have been added,
    update the
    <tt>grub.cfg</tt> file by running:
    <pre>grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg</pre>
    NOTE: Do NOT manually add the superuser account and password to the
    <tt>grub.cfg</tt> file as the grub2-mkconfig command overwrites this file.

rationale: |-
    Password protection on the boot loader configuration ensures
    users with physical access cannot trivially alter
    important bootloader settings. These include which kernel to use,
    and whether to enter single-user mode. For more information on how to configure
    the grub2 superuser account and password, please refer to

    To verify the boot loader superuser account has been set, run the following
    command:
    <pre>sudo grep -A1 "superusers\|password" /etc/grub2-efi.cfg</pre>
    The output should show the following:
    <pre>set superusers="<b>superusers-account</b>"
    export superusers
    password_pbkdf2 <b>superusers-account</b> <b>${GRUB2_PASSWORD}</b></pre>
    To verify the boot loader superuser account password has been set,
    and the password encrypted, run the following command:
    <pre>sudo cat /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/user.cfg</pre>
    The output should be similar to:
    <pre>GRUB2_PASSWORD=grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.C4E08AC72FBFF7E837FD267BFAD7AEB3D42DDC

        To prevent hard-coded passwords, automatic remediation of this control is not available. Remediation
        must be automated as a component of machine provisioning, or followed manually as outlined above.
