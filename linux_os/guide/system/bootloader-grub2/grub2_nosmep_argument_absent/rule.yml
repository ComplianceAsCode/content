title: 'Ensure SMEP is not disabled during boot'

description: |-
    The SMEP is used to prevent the supervisor mode from executing user space code,
    it is enabled by default since Linux kernel 3.0. But it could be disabled through
    kernel boot parameters.

    Ensure that Supervisor Mode Execution Prevention (SMEP) is not disabled by
    the <tt>nosmep</tt> boot paramenter option.

    Check that the line <pre>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="..."</pre> within <tt>/etc/default/grub</tt>
    doesn't contain the argument <tt>nosmep</tt>.
    Run the following command to update command line for already installed kernels:
    <pre># grubby --update-kernel=ALL --remove-args="nosmep"</pre>

rationale: |-
    Disabling SMEP can facilitate exploitation of certain vulnerabilities because it allows
    the kernel to unintentionally execute code in less privileged memory space.

ocil_clause: 'the kernel is configured to disable SMEP'

ocil: |-
    Make sure that the kernel is not disabling SMEP with the following
    commands.
    <pre>grep -q nosmep /boot/config-`uname -r`</pre>
    If the command returns a line, it means that SMEP is being disabled.
