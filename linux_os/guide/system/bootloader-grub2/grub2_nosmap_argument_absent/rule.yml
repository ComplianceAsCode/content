title: 'Ensure SMAP is not disabled during boot'

description: |-
    The SMAP is used to prevent the supervisor mode from unintentionally reading/writing into
    memory pages in the user space, it is enabled by default since Linux kernel 3.7.
    But it could be disabled through kernel boot parameters.

    Ensure that Supervisor Mode Access Prevention (SMAP) is not disabled by
    the <tt>nosmap</tt> boot paramenter option.

    Check that the line <pre>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="..."</pre> within <tt>/etc/default/grub</tt>
    doesn't contain the argument <tt>nosmap</tt>.
    Run the following command to update command line for already installed kernels:
    <pre># grubby --update-kernel=ALL --remove-args="nosmap"</pre>

rationale: |-
    Disabling SMAP can facilitate exploitation of vulnerabilities caused by unintended access and
    manipulation of data in the user space.

ocil_clause: 'the kernel is configured to disable SMAP'

ocil: |-
    Make sure that the kernel is not disabling SMAP with the following
    commands.
    <pre>grep -q nosmap /boot/config-`uname -r`</pre>
    If the command returns a line, it means that SMAP is being disabled.
