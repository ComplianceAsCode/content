title: 'Disable Recovery Booting'

description: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} systems support an "recovery boot" option that can be used
    to prevent services from being started. The <tt>GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY</tt>
    configuration option in <tt>/etc/default/grub</tt> should be set to
    <tt>true</tt> to disable the generation of recovery mode menu entries. It is
    also required to change the runtime configuration, run:
    <pre>$ sudo {{{ grub_command("update") }}}</pre>

rationale: |-
    Using recovery boot, the console user could disable auditing, firewalls,
    or other services, weakening system security.
