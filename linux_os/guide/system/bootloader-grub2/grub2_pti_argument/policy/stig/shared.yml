srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must enable mitigations against processor-based vulnerabilities.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Kernel page-table isolation is a kernel feature that mitigates the Meltdown security vulnerability and hardens the kernel against attempts to bypass kernel address space layout randomization (KASLR).



checktext: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} enables kernel page-table isolation with the following command:

    $ sudo grubby --info=ALL | grep args | grep -v 'pti=on'

    If any output is returned, this is a finding.

    Check that kernel page-table isolation is enabled by default to persist in kernel updates:

    $ grep pti /etc/default/grub

    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="pti=on"

    If "pti" is not set to "on", is missing or commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to enable kernel page-table isolation with the following command:

    $ sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args="pti=on"

    Add or modify the following line in "/etc/default/grub" to ensure the configuration survives kernel updates:

    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="pti=on"
