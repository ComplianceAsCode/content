    Having a non-default grub superuser username makes password-guessing attacks less effective.

    To verify the boot loader superuser account has been set, run the following
    command:
     sudo grep -A1 "superusers" /etc/grub2-efi.cfg
    The output should show the following:
     set superusers=" superusers-account "
    export superusers
    where superusers-account is the actual account name different from common names like root,
    admin, or administrator.

    If it does not, this is a finding.
