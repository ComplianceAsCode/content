    UEFI GRUB2 bootloader configuration

platform: uefi

warnings:
    - functionality: |-
        UEFI generally uses vfat file systems, which does not support Unix-style permissions
        managed by chmod command. In this case, in order to change file permissions for files
        within /boot/efi it is necessary to update the mount options in /etc/fstab file and
        reboot the system.
