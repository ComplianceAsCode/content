    Password protection on the boot loader configuration ensures
    users with physical access cannot trivially alter
    important bootloader settings. These include which kernel to use,
    and whether to enter single-user mode.

    To verify the boot loader superuser password has been set, run the following
    command:

     sudo grep "password" /etc/grub2-efi.cfg

    The output should show the following:
     password_pbkdf2  superusers-account   ${GRUB2_PASSWORD}
    To verify the boot loader superuser account password has been set,
    and the password encrypted, run the following command:

     sudo cat /boot/grub2/user.cfg
    The output should be similar to:
     GRUB2_PASSWORD=grub.pbkdf2.sha512.10000.C4E08AC72FBFF7E837FD267BFAD7AEB3D42DDC

    If it does not, this is a finding.
