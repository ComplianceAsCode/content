title: 'Enforce Spectre v2 mitigation'

description: |-
    Spectre V2 is an indirect branch poisoning attack that can lead to data leakage.
    An exploit for Spectre V2 tricks the indirect branch predictor into executing
    code from a future indirect branch chosen by the attacker, even if the privilege
    level is different.

    Since Linux Kernel 4.15 you can check the Spectre V2 mitigation state with the following command:
    <tt>cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spectre_v2</tt>

    Enforce the Spectre V2 mitigation by adding the argument
    <tt>spectre_v2=on</tt> to the default
    GRUB 2 command line for the Linux operating system.
    {{{ describe_grub2_argument("spectre_v2=on") | indent(4) }}}

rationale: |-
    The Spectre V2 vulnerability allows an attacker to read memory that he should not have
    access to.
