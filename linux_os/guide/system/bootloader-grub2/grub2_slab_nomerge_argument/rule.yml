title: 'Disable merging of slabs with similar size'

description: |-
    The kernel may merge similar slabs together to reduce overhead and increase
    cache hotness of objects.
    Disabling merging of slabs keeps the slabs separate and reduces the risk of
    kernel heap overflows overwriting objects in merged caches.

    To disable merging of slabs in the Kernel add the argument <tt>slab_nomerge=yes</tt>
    to the default GRUB 2 command line for the Linux operating system.
    {{{ describe_grub2_argument("slab_nomerge=yes") | indent(4) }}}

rationale: |-
    Disabling the merge of slabs of similar sizes prevents the kernel from
    merging a seemingly useless but vulnerable slab with a useful and valuable slab.
    This increase the risk that a heap overflow could overwrite objects from merged caches,
    with unmerged caches the heap overflow would only affect the objects in the same cache.
    Overall, this reduces the kernel attack surface area by isolating slabs from each other.

warnings:
    - performance: |-
       Disabling merge of slabs will slightly increase kernel memory utilization.
