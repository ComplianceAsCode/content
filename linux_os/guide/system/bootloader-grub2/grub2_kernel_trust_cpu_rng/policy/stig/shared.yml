    The Linux kernel offers an option which signifies if the kernel should trust
    data provided by CPU hardware random number generator. Hardware random
    number generators can provide random data very quickly and are used to generate random cryptographic keys. They can
    be useful during boot time when other means of getting random data can be
    slow because there is not yet enough entropy in the system.

    Make sure that the kernel is configured to trust the CPU RNG by following
    commands. To check if the option was correctly configured at kernel compile
    time, run the following command:
     grep -q CONFIG_RANDOM_TRUST_CPU=y /boot/config-`uname -r`
    If the command outputs:
     CONFIG_RANDOM_TRUST_CPU=y ,
    it means that the option is compiled into the kernel. Make sure that the
    option is not overridden through a boot parameter:
     sudo grep 'kernelopts.*random\.trust_cpu=off.*' /boot/grub2/grubenv
    The command should not return any output. If the option is not compiled into
    the kernel, check that the option is configured through boot parameter.
    Inspect the form of default GRUB 2 command line for the Linux operating system
    in "/etc/default/grub". If it includes "random.trust_cpu=on",
    then the parameter will be configured for newly installed kernels.
    First check if the GRUB recovery is enabled:
     $ sudo grep 'GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY' /etc/default/grub
    If this option is set to true, then check that a line is output by the following command:
     $ sudo grep 'GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT.*random.trust_cpu=on.*' /etc/default/grub
    If the recovery is disabled, check the line with
     $ sudo grep 'GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX.*random.trust_cpu=on.*' /etc/default/grub .Moreover, command line parameters for currently installed kernels should be checked as well.
    Run the following command:
     $ sudo grubby --info=ALL | grep args | grep -v 'random.trust_cpu=on'
    The command should not return any output.

    If the kernel is not configured to trust the CPU RNG, then this is a finding.
