title: 'Ensure debug-shell service is not enabled during boot'

description: |-
    systemd's <tt>debug-shell</tt> service is intended to
    diagnose systemd related boot issues with various <tt>systemctl</tt>
    commands. Once enabled and following a system reboot, the root shell
    will be available on <tt>tty9</tt> which is access by pressing
    <tt>CTRL-ALT-F9</tt>. The <tt>debug-shell</tt> service should only be used
    for systemd related issues and should otherwise be disabled.
    <br /><br />
    By default, the <tt>debug-shell</tt> systemd service is already disabled.

    Ensure the debug-shell is not enabled by the <tt>systemd.debug-shel=1</tt>
    boot paramenter option.

    Check that the line <pre>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="..."</pre> within <tt>/etc/default/grub</tt>
    doesn't contain the argument <tt>systemd.debug-shell=1</tt>.
    Run the following command to update command line for already installed kernels:
    <pre># grubby --update-kernel=ALL --remove-args="systemd.debug-shell"</pre>

rationale: |-
    This prevents attackers with physical access from trivially bypassing security
    on the machine through valid troubleshooting configurations and gaining root
    access when the system is rebooted.

ocil_clause: 'the comand returns a line'

ocil: |-
    Ensure that debug-shell service is not enabled with the following command:
    <pre>grep systemd\.debug-shell=1 /boot/grub2/grubenv /etc/default/grub</pre>
    If the command returns a line, it means that debug-shell service is being enabled.
