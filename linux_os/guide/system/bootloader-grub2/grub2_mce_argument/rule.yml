title: 'Force kernel panic on uncorrected MCEs'

description: |-
    A Machine Check Exception is an error generated by the CPU itdetects an error
    in itself, memory or I/O devices.
    These errors may be corrected and generate a check log entry, if an error
    cannot be corrected the kernel may panic or SIGBUS.

    To force the kernel to panic on any uncorrected error reported by Machine Check
    set the MCE tolerance to zero by adding <tt>mce=0</tt>
    to the default GRUB 2 command line for the Linux operating system.
    {{{ describe_grub2_argument("mce=0") | indent(4) }}}

rationale: |-
    Allowing uncorrected errors to result on a SIGBUS may allow an attacker to continue
    trying to exploit a vulnerability such as Rowhammer.
