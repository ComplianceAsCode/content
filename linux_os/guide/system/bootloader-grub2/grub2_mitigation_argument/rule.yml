title: 'System Must Avoid Meltdown and Spectre Exploit Vulnerabilities in Modern Processors'

description: |-
    Verify that Meltdown mitigations are not disabled:
    <pre>$ sudo grubby --info=ALL | grep mitigations</pre>

    The mitigations must not be set to "off".

rationale: |-
    Hardware vulnerabilities allow programs to steal data that is currently processed on the
    computer. While programs are typically not permitted to read data from other programs, a
    malicious program can exploit Meltdown and Spectre to obtain secrets stored in the memory of
    other running programs. This might include passwords stored in a password manager or browser;
    personal photos, emails, and instant messages; and business-critical documents.

ocil_clause: 'mitigations is set to off'

ocil: |-
    Verify that Meltdown mitigations are not disabled in any kernel:

    <pre>$ sudo grubby --info=ALL | grep mitigations</pre>


fixtext: |-
    Remove the Meltdown mitigations:

    <pre>$ sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --remove-args=mitigations=off</pre>

    Reboot the system for the change to take effect.
