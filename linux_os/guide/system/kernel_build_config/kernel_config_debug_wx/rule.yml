title: 'Warn on W+X mappings found at boot'

description: |-
    Generate a warning if any W+X mappings are found at boot.
    This configuration is available from kernel 5.8.

    {{{ describe_kernel_build_config("CONFIG_DEBUG_WX", "y") | indent(4) }}}

rationale: |-
    This is useful for discovering cases where the kernel is leaving W+X mappings after applying NX,
    as such mappings are a security risk.
    Note that even if the check fails, your kernel is possibly still fine, as W+X mappings are not
    a security hole in themselves, what they do is that they make the exploitation of other unfixed
    kernel bugs easier.
