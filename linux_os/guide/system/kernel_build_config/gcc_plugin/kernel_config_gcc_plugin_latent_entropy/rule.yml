title: 'Generate some entropy during boot and runtime'

description: |-
    Instrument some kernel code to extract some entropy from both original and artificially created
    program state. This will help especially embedded systems where there is little 'natural' source
    of entropy normally.

    This configuration is available from kernel 4.9, but may be available if backported
    by distros.

    {{{ describe_kernel_build_config("CONFIG_GCC_PLUGIN_LATENT_ENTROPY", "y") | indent(4) }}}

rationale: |-
    This helps generate entropy during startup and is particularly relevant for devices with
    inappropriate entropy sources.

warnings:
    {{{ warning_kernel_build_config() | indent(4) }}}
    - general: |-
        Note that entropy extracted this way is not cryptographically secure!
    - performance: |-
        There is a performance cost during the boot process (about 0.5%) and fork and irq processing.
