title: 'Poison kernel stack before returning from syscalls'

description: |-
    This option makes the kernel erase the kernel stack before returning from system calls.
    This has the effect of leaving the stack initialized to the poison value, which both reduces
    the lifetime of any sensitive stack contents and reduces potential for uninitialized stack
    variable exploits or information exposures (it does not cover functions reaching the same
    stack depth as prior functions during the same syscall).

    This configuration is available from kernel 4.20, but may be available if backported
    by distros.

    {{{ describe_kernel_build_config("CONFIG_GCC_PLUGIN_STACKLEAK", "y") | indent(4) }}}

rationale: |-
    This blocks most uninitialized stack variable attacks, with the performance impact being
    driven by the depth of the stack usage, rather than the function calling complexity.

warnings:
    {{{ warning_kernel_build_config() | indent(4) }}}
    - performance: |-
        The performance impact on a single CPU system kernel is of 1% slowdown.
