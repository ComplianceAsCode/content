title: 'Randomize layout of sensitive kernel structures'

description: |-
    Randomize at compile-time the layouts of structures that are entirely function pointers
    (and have not been manually annotated with __no_randomize_layout), or structures that have
    been explicitly marked with __randomize_layout.
    This configuration is available from kernel 4.13, but may be available if backported
    by distros.

    {{{ describe_kernel_build_config("CONFIG_GCC_PLUGIN_RANDSTRUCT", "y") | indent(4) }}}

rationale: |-
    Randomizing the layout of kernel data structures make it more difficult for an attacker to
    know the location of sensitive data.

warnings:
    {{{ warning_kernel_build_config() | indent(4) }}}
