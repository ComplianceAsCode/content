title: 'Force initialization of variables containing userspace addresses'

description: |-
    While the kernel is built with warnings enabled for any missed stack variable initializations,
    this warning is silenced for anything passed by reference to another function, under the
    occasionally misguided assumption that the function will do the initialization. As this
    regularly leads to exploitable flaws, this plugin is available to identify and zero-initialize
    such variables, depending on the chosen level of coverage.
    This configuration is available from kernel 4.11, but may be available if backported
    by distros.

rationale: |-
    Initializing structures from userspace can prevent some classes of information exposure.
