title: 'Unmap kernel when running in userspace (aka KAISER)'

description: |-
    Speculation attacks against some high-performance processors can be used to bypass MMU
    permission checks and leak kernel data to userspace. This can be defended against by unmapping
    the kernel when running in userspace, mapping it back in on exception entry via a trampoline
    page in the vector table.
    This configuration is available from kernel 4.16, but may be available if backported
    by distros.

rationale: |-
    This is a countermeasure to the Meltdown attack.
