title: 'Randomize the address of the kernel image (KASLR)'

description: |-
    In support of Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR), this randomizes the physical
    address at which the kernel image is decompressed and the virtual address where the kernel
    image is mapped.

    {{{ describe_kernel_build_config("CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE", "y") | indent(4) }}}

rationale: |-
    An unpredictable kernel address makes it more difficult to succeed with exploits that rely on
    knowledge of the location of kernel code internals.

warnings:
