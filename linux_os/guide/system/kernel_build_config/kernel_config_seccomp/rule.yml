title: 'Enable seccomp to safely compute untrusted bytecode'

description: |-
    This kernel feature is useful for number crunching applications that may need to compute
    untrusted bytecode during their execution. By using pipes or other transports made available
    to the process as file descriptors supporting the read/write syscalls, it's possible to isolate
    those applications in their own address space using seccomp.

rationale: |-
    <tt>seccomp</tt> enables the ability to filter system calls made by an application, effectively
    isolating the system's resources from it.
