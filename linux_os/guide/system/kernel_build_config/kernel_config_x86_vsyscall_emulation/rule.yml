title: 'Disable x86 vsyscall emulation'

description: |-
    Disabling it is roughly equivalent to booting with vsyscall=none, except that it will also
    disable the helpful warning if a program tries to use a vsyscall. With this option set to N,
    offending programs will just segfault, citing addresses of the form 0xffffffffff600?00.
    This configuration is available from kernel 3.19.

    {{{ describe_kernel_build_config("CONFIG_X86_VSYSCALL_EMULATION", "n") | indent(4) }}}

rationale: |-
    The vsyscall table is no longer required and is a potential source of ROP gadgets.

warnings:
    {{{ warning_kernel_build_config() | indent(4) }}}

severity: low
