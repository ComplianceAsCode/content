title: 'Enable checks on credential management'

description: |-
    Enable this to turn on some debug checking for credential management. The additional code keeps
    track of the number of pointers from task_structs to any given cred struct, and checks to see
    that this number never exceeds the usage count of the cred struct.

    Furthermore, if SELinux is enabled, this also checks that the security pointer in the cred
    struct is never seen to be invalid.
