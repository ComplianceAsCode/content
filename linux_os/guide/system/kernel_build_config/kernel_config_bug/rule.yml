title: 'Enable support for BUG()'

description: |-
    Disabling this option eliminates support for BUG and WARN, reducing the size of your kernel
    image and potentially quietly ignoring numerous fatal conditions. You should only consider
    disabling this option for embedded systems with no facilities for reporting errors.

    {{{ describe_kernel_build_config("CONFIG_BUG", "y") | indent(4) }}}

rationale: |-
    Not setting this variable may hide a number of critical errors.

warnings:
    {{{ warning_kernel_build_config() | indent(4) }}}

severity: medium
