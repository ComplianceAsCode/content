title: 'Disable mutable hooks'

description: |-
    Ensure kernel structures associated with LSMs are always mapped as read-only after system boot.

    {{{ describe_kernel_build_config("CONFIG_SECURITY_WRITABLE_HOOKS", "y") | indent(4) }}}

rationale: |-
    If CONFIG_SECURITY_WRITABLE_HOOKS is enabled, then hooks can be loaded at runtime and
    being able to manipulate hooks is a way to bypass all LSMs.

warnings:
