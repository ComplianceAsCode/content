title: 'Detect stack corruption on calls to schedule()'

description: |-
    This option checks for a stack overrun on calls to schedule(). If the stack end location is
    found to be overwritten always panic as the content of the corrupted region can no longer
    be trusted.
    This configuration is available from kernel 3.18.

    {{{ describe_kernel_build_config("CONFIG_SCHED_STACK_END_CHECK", "y") | indent(4) }}}

rationale: |-
   This ensures no erroneous behaviour occurs which could result in data corruption or a
   sporadic crash at a later stage once the region is examined.
