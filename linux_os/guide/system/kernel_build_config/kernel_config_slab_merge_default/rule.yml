title: 'Disallow merge of slab caches'

description: |-
    For reduced kernel memory fragmentation, slab caches can be merged when they share the same
    size and other characteristics. This carries a risk of kernel heap overflows being able to
    overwrite objects from merged caches (and more easily control cache layout), which makes such
    heap attacks easier to exploit by attackers.
    This configuration is available from kernel 4.13.

    {{{ describe_kernel_build_config("CONFIG_SLAB_MERGE_DEFAULT", "n") | indent(4) }}}

rationale: |-
    Disabling the merge of slabs of similar sizes prevents the kernel from
    merging a seemingly useless but vulnerable slab with a useful and valuable slab.
    This increase the risk that a heap overflow could overwrite objects from merged caches,
    with unmerged caches the heap overflow would only affect the objects in the same cache.
    Overall, this reduces the kernel attack surface area by isolating slabs from each other.
