title: 'Disable kexec system call'

description: |-
    <tt>kexec</tt> is a system call that implements the ability to shutdown your current kernel,
    and to start another kernel. It is like a reboot but it is independent of the system firmware.
    And like a reboot you can start any kernel with it, not just Linux.
