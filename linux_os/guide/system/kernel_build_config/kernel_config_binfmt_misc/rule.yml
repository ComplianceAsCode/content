title: 'Disable kernel support for MISC binaries'

description: |-
    Enabling <tt>CONFIG_BINFMT_MISC</tt> makes it possible to plug wrapper-driven binary formats
    into the kernel. This is specially useful for programs that need an interpreter to run like
    Java, Python and DOS emulators. Once you have registered such a binary class with the kernel,
    you can start one of those programs simply by typing in its name at a shell prompt.

    {{{ describe_kernel_build_config("CONFIG_BINFMT_MISC", "n") | indent(4) }}}

rationale: |-
    This disables arbitrary binary format support and helps reduce attack surface.
