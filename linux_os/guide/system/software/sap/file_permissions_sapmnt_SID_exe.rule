title: 'Permissions of Directory /sapmnt/SID/exe is 755'

description: |-
    It is recommended to apply permissions <tt>755</tt> to directory
    <tt>/sapmnt/SID/exe</tt>. 
    <tt>SID</tt> is SAP System ID which is always three alphanumeric characters in upper case
    beginning with an alphabetic character.
    Use the following commands to set correct permissions (works for multiple SIDs): 
    <pre>$sudo find /sapmnt -regex '^/sapmnt/[A-Z][A-Z0-9][A-Z0-9]/exe$' -exec chmod 755 {} \;</pre>
