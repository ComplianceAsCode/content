title: 'Install an Endpoint Security Solution'

description: |-
    Verify that an Endpoint Security Solution has been deployed on the operating system.  
    If there is not an Endpoint Security Solution deployed, this is a finding.

rationale: |-
    Without the use of automated mechanisms to scan for security flaws on a continuous
    and/or periodic basis, the operating system or other system components may remain
    vulnerable to the exploits presented by undetected software flaws.

    To support this requirement, the operating system may have an integrated solution
    incorporating continuous scanning and periodic scanning using other tools,
    as specified in the requirement.

fixtext: |-
    Install an Endpoint Security Solution that can provide a continuous mechanism to
    monitor the state of system components with regard to flaw remediation and
    threat prevention.
