title: 'Install the Host Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) Module'

description: |-
    Install the McAfee Host Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) Module if it is absolutely
    necessary. If SELinux is enabled, do not install or enable this module.

rationale: |-
    Without a host-based intrusion detection tool, there is no system-level defense
    when an intruder gains access to a system or network. Additionally, a host-based
    intrusion prevention tool can provide methods to immediately lock out detected
    intrusion attempts.

warnings:
    - functionality: |-
        Installing and enabling this module conflicts with SELinux.
        Per DoD/DISA guidance, SELinux takes precedence over this module.
    - general: |-
        Due to McAfee HIPS being 3rd party software, automated
        remediation is not available for this configuration check.
