description: 'Install the Asset Configuration Compliance Module (ACCM).'

rationale: |-
    Without a host-based intrusion detection tool, there is no system-level defense
    when an intruder gains access to a system or network. Additionally, a host-based
    intrusion prevention tool can provide methods to immediately lock out detected
    intrusion attempts.
