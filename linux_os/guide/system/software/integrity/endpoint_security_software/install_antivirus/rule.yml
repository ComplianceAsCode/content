title: 'Install Virus Scanning Software'

description: |-
    Install virus scanning software, which uses signatures to search for the
    presence of viruses on the filesystem.
    Ensure virus definition files are no older than 7 days, or their last release.

    Configure the virus scanning software to perform scans dynamically on all
    accessed files.  If this is not possible, configure the
    system to scan all altered files on the system on a daily
    basis. If the system processes inbound SMTP mail, configure the virus scanner
    to scan all received mail.

rationale: |-
    Virus scanning software can be used to detect if a system has been compromised by
    computer viruses, as well as to limit their spread to other systems.

ocil_clause: 'virus scanning software does not run continuously, or at least daily, or has signatures that are out of date'

ocil: |-
    Inspect the system for a cron job or system service which executes
    a virus scanning tool regularly.
