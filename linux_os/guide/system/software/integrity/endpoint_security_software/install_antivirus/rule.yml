title: 'Install Virus Scanning Software'

description: |-
    Virus scanning software can be used to protect a system from penetration from
    computer viruses and to limit their spread through intermediate systems.

    The virus scanning software should be configured to perform scans dynamically
    on accessed files. If this capability is not available, the system must be
    configured to scan, at a minimum, all altered files on the system on a daily
    basis.

    If the system processes inbound SMTP mail, the virus scanner must be configured
    to scan all received mail.

rationale: |-
    Virus scanning software can be used to detect if a system has been compromised by
    computer viruses, as well as to limit their spread to other systems.
