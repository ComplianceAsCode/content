title: 'Install Intrusion Detection Software'

description: |-
    The base Red Hat platform already includes a sophisticated auditing system that
    can detect intruder activity, as well as SELinux, which provides host-based
    intrusion prevention capabilities by confining privileged programs and user
    sessions which may become compromised.

rationale: |-
    Host-based intrusion detection tools provide a system-level defense when an
    intruder gains access to a system or network.

ocil_clause: 'no host-based intrusion detection tools are installed'

ocil: |-
    Inspect the system to determine if intrusion detection software has been installed.
    Verify this intrusion detection software is active.

warnings:
    - general: |-
        Note in DoD environments, supplemental intrusion
        detection tools, such as the McAfee Host-based Security System, are available
        to integrate with existing infrastructure. When these supplemental tools
        interfere with proper functioning of SELinux, SELinux takes precedence.
