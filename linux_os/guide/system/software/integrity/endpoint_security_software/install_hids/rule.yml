title: 'Install Intrusion Detection Software'

description: |-
    The base {{{ full_name }}} platform already includes a sophisticated auditing system that
    can detect intruder activity, as well as SELinux, which provides host-based
    intrusion prevention capabilities by confining privileged programs and user
    sessions which may become compromised.

rationale: |-
    Host-based intrusion detection tools provide a system-level defense when an
    intruder gains access to a system or network.

ocil_clause: 'no host-based intrusion detection tools are installed'

ocil: |-
    Inspect the system to determine if intrusion detection software has been installed.
    Verify this intrusion detection software is active.

warnings:
    - general: |-
        In DoD environments, supplemental intrusion detection and antivirus tools,
        such as the McAfee Host-based Security System, are available to integrate with
        existing infrastructure. Per DISA guidance, when these supplemental tools interfere
        with proper functioning of SELinux, SELinux takes precedence. Should further
        clarification be required, DISA contact information is published publicly at
        https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/
