title: "Set kernel parameter 'crypto.fips_enabled' to 1"

description: |-
    System running in FIPS mode is indicated by kernel parameter
    <tt>'crypto.fips_enabled'</tt>. This parameter should be set to <tt>1</tt> in FIPS mode.
    To enable FIPS mode, run the following command:
    <pre>fips-mode-setup --enable</pre>

    To enable strict FIPS compliance, the fips=1 kernel option needs to be added to the kernel boot
    parameters during system installation so key generation is done with FIPS-approved algorithms
    and continuous monitoring tests in place.

rationale: |-
    Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption to
    protect data. The operating system must implement cryptographic modules adhering to the higher
    standards approved by the federal government since this provides assurance they have been tested
    and validated.

ocil_clause: 'crypto.fips_enabled is not 1'

ocil: |-
    To verify that kernel parameter 'crypto.fips_enabled' is set properly, run the following command:
    <pre>sysctl crypto.fips_enabled</pre>
    The output should contain the following:
    <pre>crypto.fips_enabled = 1</pre>

warnings:
    - general: |-
        The system needs to be rebooted for these changes to take effect.
    - regulatory: |-
        System Crypto Modules must be provided by a vendor that undergoes FIPS-140 certifications.
        FIPS-140 is applicable to all Federal agencies that use cryptographic-based security
        systems to protect sensitive information in computer and telecommunication systems
        (including voice systems) as defined in Section 5131 of the Information Technology
        Management Reform Act of 1996, Public Law 104-106. This standard shall be used in designing
        and implementing cryptographic modules that Federal departments and agencies operate or are
        operated for them under contract.
        See <b>{{{ weblink(link="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf") }}}</b>
        To meet this, the system has to have cryptographic software provided by a vendor that has
        undergone this certification. This means providing documentation, test results, design
        information, and independent third party review by an accredited lab. While open source
        software is capable of meeting this, it does not meet FIPS-140 unless the vendor submits to
        this process.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the operating system to implement FIPS mode with the following command:

    $ sudo fips-mode-setup --enable

    Reboot the system for the changes to take effect.

srg_requirement:
    '{{{ full_name }}} must implement NIST FIPS-validated cryptography for the following: to
    provision digital signatures, to generate cryptographic hashes, and to
    protect data requiring data-at-rest protections in accordance with
    applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies,
    regulations, and standards.'

checktext: |-
    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} is in FIPS mode with the following command:
    $ sudo fips-mode-setup --check
    FIPS mode is enabled.
    If FIPS mode is not enabled, this is a finding.
