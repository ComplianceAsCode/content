title: "Set kernel parameter 'crypto.fips_enabled' to 1"

description: |-
    System running in FIPS mode is indicated by kernel parameter
    <tt>'crypto.fips_enabled'</tt>. This parameter should be set to <tt>1</tt>
    in FIPS mode.
    To enable FIPS mode, run the following command:
    <pre>fips-mode-setup --enable</pre>

rationale: |-
    Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption to
    protect data. The operating system must implement cryptographic modules adhering to the higher
    standards approved by the federal government since this provides assurance they have been tested
    and validated.

ocil: |-
    To verify that kernel parameter 'crypto.fips_enabled' is set properly, run the following command:
    <pre>sysctl crypto.fips_enabled</pre>
    The output should contain the following:
    <pre>crypto.fips_enabled =  1</pre>

warnings:
    - general: |-
        The system needs to be rebooted for these changes to take effect.
    - regulatory: |-
        The ability to enable FIPS does not denote FIPS compliancy or certification.
        {{% if product == "ol8" %}}
        Oracle Linux is FIPS certified and compliant.
        {{% else %}}
        Red Hat, Inc. and Red Hat Enterprise Linux are respectively FIPS certified and compliant.
        {{% endif %}}
        Community projects such as CentOS, Scientific Linux, Fedora, etc. do not necessarily meet
        FIPS certification and compliancy. Therefore, non-certified vendors and/or projects do not
        meet this requirement even if technically feasible.
