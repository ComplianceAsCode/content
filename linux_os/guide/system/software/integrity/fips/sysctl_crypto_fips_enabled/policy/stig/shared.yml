srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must implement NIST FIPS-validated cryptography for the following: to
    provision digital signatures, to generate cryptographic hashes, and to
    protect data requiring data-at-rest protections in accordance with
    applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies,
    regulations, and standards.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption to
    protect data. The operating system must implement cryptographic modules adhering to the higher
    standards approved by the federal government since this provides assurance they have been tested
    and validated.

checktext: |-
    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} is in FIPS mode with the following command:

    $ sudo fips-mode-setup --check

    FIPS mode is enabled.

    If FIPS mode is not enabled, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the operating system to implement FIPS mode with the following command

    $ sudo fips-mode-setup --enable

    Reboot the system for the changes to take effect.
