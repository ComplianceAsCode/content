    Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption to
    protect data. The operating system must implement cryptographic modules adhering to the higher
    standards approved by the federal government since this provides assurance they have been tested
    and validated.

    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} is in FIPS mode with the following command:

    cat /proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled

    If the command doesn't return 1, this is a finding.

    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to implement FIPS mode the installer kernel must be started with fips=1.


    If this checks fails on an installed system it is a permanent finding until the system is reinstalled.
