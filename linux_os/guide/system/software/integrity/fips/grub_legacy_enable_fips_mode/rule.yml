title: 'Enable FIPS Mode in GRUB Legacy'

description: |-
    To ensure FIPS mode is enabled, rebuild <tt>initramfs</tt> by running the following command:
    <pre>dracut -f</pre>
    After the <tt>dracut</tt> command has been run, add the argument <tt>fips=1</tt> to the default
    GRUB kernel line for the Linux operating system in
    <tt>/etc/grub.conf</tt>, in the manner below:
    <pre>kernel /vmlinuz-version ro vga=ext root=/dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00 rhgb quiet fips=1</pre>

rationale: |-
    Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption to
    protect data. The operating system must implement cryptographic modules adhering to the higher
    standards approved by the federal government since this provides assurance they have been tested
    and validated.

ocil_clause: 'FIPS is not configured or enabled in grub'

ocil: |-
    To verify that FIPS is enabled properly in grub, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep fips /etc/grub.conf</pre>
    The output should contain fips=1

warnings:
    - functionality: |-
        Running <pre>dracut -f</pre> will overwrite the existing initramfs file.
    - general: |-
        The system needs to be rebooted for these changes to take effect.
    - regulatory: |-
        The Federal Information Systems Modernization Act (FISMA), requires cryptography protecting sensitive
        or valuable data to undergo FIPS 140 validation. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and
        Technology (NIST) views unvalidated cryptography as providing no protection to the information or
        dataâ€”in effect the data would be considered unprotected plaintext. If the agency specifies that the
        information or data be cryptographically protected, FIPS 140 is applicable. This configuration
        check will fail on platforms lacking FIPS 140 validation, such as the CentOS, Scientific Linux,
        and Fedora projects, even if FIPS-approved ciphers can be installed and enabled.
