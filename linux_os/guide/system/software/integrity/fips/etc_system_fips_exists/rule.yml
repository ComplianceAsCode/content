title: Ensure '/etc/system-fips' exists

description: |-
    On a system where FIPS mode is enabled, <tt>/etc/system-fips</tt> must exist.
    To enable FIPS mode, run the following command:
    <pre>fips-mode-setup --enable</pre>

rationale: |-
    Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption to
    protect data. The operating system must implement cryptographic modules adhering to the higher
    standards approved by the federal government since this provides assurance they have been tested
    and validated.

ocil_clause: /etc/system-fips does not exist

ocil: |-
    To verify <tt>/etc/system-fips</tt> exists, run the following command:
    <pre>ls -l /etc/system-fips</pre>
    The output should be similar to the the following:
    <pre>-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 36 Nov 26 11:31 /etc/system-fips</pre>

warnings:
    - general: |-
        The system needs to be rebooted for these changes to take effect.
    - regulatory: |-
        The ability to enable FIPS does not denote FIPS compliancy or certification.
        {{% if product == "ol8" %}}
        Oracle Linux is FIPS certified and compliant.
        {{% else %}}
        Red Hat, Inc. and Red Hat Enterprise Linux are respectively FIPS certified and compliant.
        {{% endif %}}
        Community projects such as CentOS, Scientific Linux, Fedora, etc. do not necessarily meet
        FIPS certification and compliancy. Therefore, non-certified vendors and/or projects do not
        meet this requirement even if technically feasible.
