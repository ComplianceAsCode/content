title: Ensure '/etc/system-fips' exists

description: |-
    On a system where FIPS mode is enabled, <tt>/etc/system-fips</tt> must exist.
    To enable FIPS mode, run the following command:
    <pre>fips-mode-setup --enable</pre>

rationale: |-
    Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption to
    protect data. The operating system must implement cryptographic modules adhering to the higher
    standards approved by the federal government since this provides assurance they have been tested
    and validated.

ocil_clause: /etc/system-fips does not exist

ocil: |-
    To verify <tt>/etc/system-fips</tt> exists, run the following command:
    <pre>ls -l /etc/system-fips</pre>
    The output should be similar to the the following:
    <pre>-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 36 Nov 26 11:31 /etc/system-fips</pre>

warnings:
    - general: |-
        The system needs to be rebooted for these changes to take effect.
    - regulatory: |-
        The Federal Information Systems Modernization Act (FISMA), requires cryptography protecting sensitive
        or valuable data to undergo FIPS 140 validation. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and
        Technology (NIST) views unvalidated cryptography as providing no protection to the information or
        data—in effect the data would be considered unprotected plaintext. If the agency specifies that the
        information or data be cryptographically protected, FIPS 140 is applicable. This configuration DOES NOT GUARANTEE that the system is FIPS 140-2 certified! This configuration guarantees only that certain features required by FIPS 140-2 can be enabled on this system.
