title: "Enable Dracut FIPS Module"

description: |-
    To enable FIPS mode, run the following command:
    <pre>fips-mode-setup --enable</pre>
    To enable FIPS, the system requires that the <tt>fips</tt> module is added in
    <tt>dracut</tt> configuration.
    Check if <tt>/etc/dracut.conf.d/40-fips.conf</tt> contain <tt>add_dracutmodules+=" fips "</tt>

rationale: |-
    Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption to
    protect data. The operating system must implement cryptographic modules adhering to the higher
    standards approved by the federal government since this provides assurance they have been tested
    and validated.

ocil_clause: 'the Dracut FIPS module is not enabled'

ocil: |-
    To verify that the Dracut FIPS module is enabled, run the following command:
    <tt>grep "add_dracutmodules" /etc/dracut.conf.d/40-fips.conf</tt>
    The output should look like this:
    <tt>add_dracutmodules+=" fips "</tt>

warnings:
    - general: |-
        The system needs to be rebooted for these changes to take effect.
    - regulatory: |-
        The ability to enable FIPS does not denote FIPS compliancy or certification.
        {{% if product == "ol8" %}}
        Oracle Linux is FIPS certified and compliant.
        {{% else %}}
        Red Hat, Inc. and Red Hat Enterprise Linux are respectively FIPS certified and compliant.
        {{% endif %}}
        Community projects such as CentOS, Scientific Linux, Fedora, etc. do not necessarily meet
        FIPS certification and compliancy. Therefore, non-certified vendors and/or projects do not
        meet this requirement even if technically feasible.
