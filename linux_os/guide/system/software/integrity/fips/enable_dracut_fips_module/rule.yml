title: "Enable Dracut FIPS Module"

description: |-
    To enable FIPS mode, run the following command:
    <pre>fips-mode-setup --enable</pre>
    To enable FIPS, the system requires that the <tt>fips</tt> module is added in <tt>dracut</tt> configuration.
    Check if <tt>/etc/dracut.conf.d/40-fips.conf</tt> contain <tt>add_dracutmodules+=" fips "</tt>

rationale: |-
    Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption to
    protect data. The operating system must implement cryptographic modules adhering to the higher
    standards approved by the federal government since this provides assurance they have been tested
    and validated.

ocil_clause: 'the Dracut FIPS module is not enabled'

ocil: |-
    To verify that the Dracut FIPS module is enabled, run the following command:
    <tt>grep "add_dracutmodules" /etc/dracut.conf.d/40-fips.conf</tt>
    The output should look like this:
    <tt>add_dracutmodules+=" fips "</tt>

        System Crypto Modules must be provided by a vendor that undergoes FIPS-140 certifications.
        FIPS-140 is applicable to all Federal agencies that use cryptographic-based security
        systems to protect sensitive information in computer and telecommunication systems
        (including voice systems) as defined in Section 5131 of the Information Technology
        Management Reform Act of 1996, Public Law 104-106. This standard shall be used in designing
        and implementing cryptographic modules that Federal departments and agencies operate or are
        operated for them under contract.
        See <b>{{{ weblink(link="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf") }}}</b>
        To meet this, the system has to have cryptographic software provided by a vendor that has
        undergone this certification. This means providing documentation, test results, design
        information, and independent third party review by an accredited lab. While open source
        software is capable of meeting this, it does not meet FIPS-140 unless the vendor submits to
        this process.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to run in FIPS mode.

    Run the following command to enable FIPS mode:
    $ sudo fips-mode-setup --enable

    Check the /etc/dracut.conf.d/40-fips.conf file and make sure it includes the following line:
    add_dracutmodules+=" fips "

    The system needs to be rebooted for these changes to take effect.
