srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must implement NIST FIPS-validated cryptography for the following: to provision digital signatures, to generate cryptographic hashes, and to protect data requiring data-at-rest protections in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption to
    protect data. The operating system must implement cryptographic modules adhering to the higher
    standards approved by the federal government since this provides assurance they have been tested
    and validated.

    Verify that RHEl 9 is in FIPS mode with the following command:

    $ fips-mode-setup --check

    FIPS mode is enabled.

    If FIPS mode is not enabled, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to run in FIPS mode with the following command:

    $ sudo fips-mode-setup --enable

    The system needs to be rebooted for these changes to take effect.
