title: Enable FIPS Mode

description: |-
    {{% if product == "sle12" %}}
    Enabling FIPS mode on a preexisting system involves a number of
    modifications to the SUSE operating system. Refer to section 9.1, "Crypto
    Officer Guidance", of the following document for installation guidance:

    {{{ weblink(link="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/140sp/140sp2435.pdf") }}}
    {{% else %}}
    To enable FIPS mode, run the following command:
    <pre>fips-mode-setup --enable</pre>
    <br />
    The <tt>fips-mode-setup</tt> command will configure the system in
    FIPS mode by automatically configuring the following:
    <ul>
    <li>Setting the kernel FIPS mode flag (<tt>/proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled</tt>) to <tt>1</tt></li>
    <li>Creating <tt>/etc/system-fips</tt></li>
    <li>Setting the system crypto policy in <tt>/etc/crypto-policies/config</tt> to <tt>FIPS</tt></li>
    <li>Loading the Dracut <tt>fips</tt> module</li>
    </ul>
    {{% endif %}}
    Furthermore, the system running in FIPS mode should be FIPS certified by NIST.

rationale: |-
    Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption to
    protect data. The operating system must implement cryptographic modules adhering to the higher
    standards approved by the federal government since this provides assurance they have been tested
    and validated.

    To verify that FIPS is enabled properly, run the following command:
    <pre># cat /proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled</pre>
    The output should be <tt>1</tt>.
    {{% else %}}
    To verify that FIPS is enabled properly, run the following command:
    <pre>fips-mode-setup --check</pre>
    The output should contain the following:
    <pre>FIPS mode is enabled.</pre>
    {{% endif %}}

warnings:
    - general: |-
        The system needs to be rebooted for these changes to take effect.
    - regulatory: |-
        The ability to enable FIPS does not denote FIPS compliancy or certification.
        {{% if product in ["ol8", "sle12"] %}}
        {{{ full_name }}} is FIPS certified and compliant.
        {{% else %}}
        Red Hat, Inc. and Red Hat Enterprise Linux are respectively FIPS certified and compliant.
        {{% endif %}}
        Community projects such as CentOS, Scientific Linux, Fedora, etc. do not necessarily meet
        FIPS certification and compliancy. Therefore, non-certified vendors and/or projects do not
        meet this requirement even if technically feasible.
