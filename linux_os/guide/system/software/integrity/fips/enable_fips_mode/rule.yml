title: Enable FIPS Mode

description: |-
    To enable FIPS mode, run the following command:
    <pre>fips-mode-setup --enable</pre>
    <br />
    The <tt>fips-mode-setup</tt> command will configure the system in
    FIPS mode by automatically configuring the following:
    <ul>
    <li>Setting the kernel FIPS mode flag (<tt>/proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled</tt>) to <tt>1</tt></li>
    <li>Creating <tt>/etc/system-fips</tt></li>
    <li>Setting the system crypto policy in <tt>/etc/crypto-policies/config</tt> to <tt>FIPS</tt></li>
    <li>Loading the Dracut <tt>fips</tt> module</li>
    </ul>
    Furthermore, the system running in FIPS mode should be FIPS certified by NIST.

rationale: |-
    Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption to
    protect data. The operating system must implement cryptographic modules adhering to the higher
    standards approved by the federal government since this provides assurance they have been tested
    and validated.

ocil_clause: 'FIPS mode is not enabled'

ocil: |-
    To verify that FIPS is enabled properly, run the following command:
    <pre>fips-mode-setup --check</pre>
    The output should contain the following:
    <pre>FIPS mode is enabled.</pre>

warnings:
    - general: |-
        The system needs to be rebooted for these changes to take effect.
    - regulatory: |-
        The Federal Information Systems Modernization Act (FISMA), requires cryptography protecting sensitive
        or valuable data to undergo FIPS 140 validation. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and
        Technology (NIST) views unvalidated cryptography as providing no protection to the information or
        dataâ€”in effect the data would be considered unprotected plaintext. If the agency specifies that the
        information or data be cryptographically protected, FIPS 140 is applicable. This configuration DOES NOT GUARANTEE that the system is FIPS 140-2 certified! This configuration guarantees only that certain features required by FIPS 140-2 can be enabled on this system.
