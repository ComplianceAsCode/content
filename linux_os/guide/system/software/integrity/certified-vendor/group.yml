title: 'Operating System Vendor Support and Certification'

description: |-
    The assurance of a vendor to provide operating system support and maintenance
    for their product is an important criterion to ensure product stability and
    security over the life of the product. A certified product that follows the
    necessary standards and government certification requirements guarantees that
    known software vulnerabilities will be remediated, and proper guidance for
    protecting and securing the operating system will be given.
