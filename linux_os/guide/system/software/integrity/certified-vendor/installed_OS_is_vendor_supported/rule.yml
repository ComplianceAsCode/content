title: 'The Installed Operating System Is Vendor Supported'

description: |-
    The installed operating system must be maintained by a vendor.
{{% if product in ["ol7", "ol8"] %}}
    Oracle Linux is supported by Oracle Corporation. As the Oracle
    Linux vendor, Oracle Corporation is responsible for providing security patches.
{{% elif product == "sle12" %}}
    SUSE Linux Enterprise is supported by SUSE. As the SUSE Linux Enterprise
    vendor, SUSE is responsible for providing security patches.
{{% else %}}
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux is supported by Red Hat, Inc. As the Red Hat Enterprise
    Linux vendor, Red Hat, Inc. is responsible for providing security patches.
{{% endif %}}


rationale: |-
    An operating system is considered "supported" if the vendor continues to
    provide security patches for the product.  With an unsupported release, it
    will not be possible to resolve any security issue discovered in the system
    software.

warnings:
    - general: |-
        There is no remediation besides switching to a different operating system.

ocil: |-
    To verify that the installed operating system is supported, run
    the following command:
{{% if product in ["rhel6", "rhel7", "rhel8"] %}}
    <pre>$ grep -i "red hat" /etc/redhat-release</pre>
{{% elif product in ["ol7", "ol8"] %}}
    <pre>$ grep -i "oracle" /etc/oracle-release</pre>
{{% elif product in ["sle12"] %}}
    <pre>$ grep -i "suse" /etc/os-release</pre>
{{% endif %}}
    The output should contain something similar to:
    <pre>{{{ full_name }}}</pre>
