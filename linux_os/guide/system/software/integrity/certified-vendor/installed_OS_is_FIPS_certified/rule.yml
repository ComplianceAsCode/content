title: 'The Installed Operating System Is FIPS 140-2 Certified'

description: |-
    To enable processing of sensitive information the operating system must
    provide certified cryptographic modules compliant with FIPS 140-2
    standard.
    {{% if product in ["rhel6", "rhel7"] %}}
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux is supported by Red Hat, Inc. As the Red Hat Enterprise
    Linux vendor, Red Hat, Inc. is responsible for maintaining government certifications and standards.
    {{% endif %}}

rationale: |-
    The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-2, (FIPS
    PUB 140-2) is a computer security standard. The standard specifies security
    requirements for cryptographic modules used to protect sensitive
    unclassified information.  Refer to the full FIPS 140-2 standard at
    {{{ weblink(link="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips140-2/fips1402.pdf") }}}
    for further details on the requirements.
    FIPS 140-2 validation is required by U.S. law when information systems use
    cryptography to protect sensitive government information. In order to
    achieve FIPS 140-2 certification, cryptographic modules are subject to
    extensive testing by independent laboratories, accredited by National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

ocil: |-
    To verify that the installed operating system is supported or certified, run
    the following command:
    <pre>$ grep -i "red hat" /etc/redhat-release</pre>
