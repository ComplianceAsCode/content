title: 'The Installed Operating System Is FIPS 140-2 Certified'

description: |-
    To enable processing of sensitive information the operating system must
    provide certified cryptographic modules compliant with FIPS 140-2
    standard.

    Red Hat Enterprise Linux is supported by Red Hat, Inc. As the Red Hat Enterprise
    Linux vendor, Red Hat, Inc. is responsible for maintaining government certifications and standards.

    SUSE Enterprise Linux is supported by SUSE Software Solutions Germany GmbH. As the SUSE Enterprise
    Linux vendor, SUSE Software Solutions Germany GmbH is responsible for maintaining government
    certifications and standards.

    Ubuntu Linux is supported by Canonical Ltd. As the Ubuntu Linux Vendor, Canonical Ltd. is
    responsible for government certifications and standards.

    Users of Ubuntu Linux either need an Ubuntu Advantage subscription or need
    to be using Ubuntu Pro from a sponsored vendor in order to have access to
    FIPS content supported by Canonical.

rationale: |-
    The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-2, (FIPS
    PUB 140-2) is a computer security standard. The standard specifies security
    requirements for cryptographic modules used to protect sensitive
    unclassified information.  Refer to the full FIPS 140-2 standard at
    {{{ weblink(link="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips140-2/fips1402.pdf") }}}
    for further details on the requirements.
    FIPS 140-2 validation is required by U.S. law when information systems use
    cryptography to protect sensitive government information. In order to
    achieve FIPS 140-2 certification, cryptographic modules are subject to
    extensive testing by independent laboratories, accredited by National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

warnings:
    - general: |-
        There is no remediation besides switching to a different operating system.
    - regulatory: |-
        System Crypto Modules must be provided by a vendor that undergoes
        FIPS-140 certifications.
        FIPS-140 is applicable to all Federal agencies that use
        cryptographic-based security systems to protect sensitive information
        in computer and telecommunication systems (including voice systems) as
        defined in Section 5131 of the Information Technology Management Reform
        Act of 1996, Public Law 104-106. This standard shall be used in
        designing and implementing cryptographic modules that Federal
        departments and agencies operate or are operated for them under
        contract. See <b>{{{ weblink(link="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf") }}}</b>
        To meet this, the system has to have cryptographic software provided by
        a vendor that has undergone this certification. This means providing
        documentation, test results, design information, and independent third
        party review by an accredited lab. While open source software is
        capable of meeting this, it does not meet FIPS-140 unless the vendor
        submits to this process.

ocil_clause: 'the installed operating system is not FIPS 140-2 certified'

ocil: |-
    To verify that the installed operating system is supported or certified, run
    the following command:
{{% if product in ["rhel7"] %}}
    <pre>$ grep -i "red hat" /etc/redhat-release</pre>
{{% elif product == "ol7" %}}
    <pre>$ grep -i "oracle" /etc/oracle-release</pre>
{{% elif product in ["sle12", "sle15"] %}}
    <pre>$ grep -i "suse" /etc/os-release</pre>
{{% elif product in ["ubuntu1604", "ubuntu1804", "ubuntu2004", "ubuntu2204"] %}}
    <pre>$ grep -i "ubuntu" /etc/os-release</pre>
{{% endif %}}
    The output should contain something similar to:
    <pre>{{{ full_name }}}</pre>
