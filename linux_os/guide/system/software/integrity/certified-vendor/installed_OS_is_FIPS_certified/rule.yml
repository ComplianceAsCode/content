title: 'The Installed Operating System Is FIPS 140-2 Certified'

description: |-
    To enable processing of sensitive information the operating system must
    provide certified cryptographic modules compliant with FIPS 140-2
    standard.
{{% if product in ["rhel6", "rhel7"] %}}
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux is supported by Red Hat, Inc. As the Red Hat Enterprise
    Linux vendor, Red Hat, Inc. is responsible for maintaining government certifications and standards.
{{% endif %}}

rationale: |-
    The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-2, (FIPS
    PUB 140-2) is a computer security standard. The standard specifies security
    requirements for cryptographic modules used to protect sensitive
    unclassified information.  Refer to the full FIPS 140-2 standard at
    {{{ weblink(link="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips140-2/fips1402.pdf") }}}
    for further details on the requirements.
    FIPS 140-2 validation is required by U.S. law when information systems use
    cryptography to protect sensitive government information. In order to
    achieve FIPS 140-2 certification, cryptographic modules are subject to
    extensive testing by independent laboratories, accredited by National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

warnings:
    - general: |-
        There is no remediation besides switching to a different operating system.
    - regulatory: |-
        The Federal Information Systems Modernization Act (FISMA), requires cryptography protecting sensitive
        or valuable data to undergo FIPS 140 validation. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and
        Technology (NIST) views unvalidated cryptography as providing no protection to the information or
        dataâ€”in effect the data would be considered unprotected plaintext. If the agency specifies that the
        information or data be cryptographically protected, FIPS 140 is applicable. This configuration
        check will fail on platforms lacking FIPS 140 validation, such as the CentOS, Scientific Linux,
        and Fedora projects, even if FIPS-approved ciphers can be installed and enabled.

        A list of FIPS validated cryptographic modules can be found at
        <b>{{{ weblink(link="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/1401vend.htm") }}}</b>. The
        validated cryptographic modules only apply to the products and companies listed in the active validation
        list.

ocil_clause: 'the installed operating system is not FIPS 140-2 certified'

ocil: |-
    To verify that the installed operating system is supported or certified, run
    the following command:
{{% if product in ["rhel6", "rhel7"] %}}
    <pre>$ grep -i "red hat" /etc/redhat-release</pre>
{{% elif product == "ol7" %}}
    <pre>$ grep -i "oracle" /etc/oracle-release</pre>
{{% endif %}}
    The output should contain something similar to:
    <pre>{{{ full_name }}}</pre>
