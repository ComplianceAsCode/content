title: Implement Custom Crypto Policy Modules for CIS Benchmark

description: |-
    Create a custom crypto policy module to enforce the use of strong ciphers and MACs in SSHD, disable CBC mode ciphers in SSHD and disable the use of weak MACs globally.
    {{% for module_name, sub_policy in sub_policies.items() %}}
    {{{ describe_crypto_sub_policy(module_name, sub_policy.key, sub_policy.value) }}}
    {{% endfor %}}
    Then, set the system wide crypto policy to use the custom policy.
    <pre>
    $ sudo update-crypto-policies --set {{{ base_policy }}}:{{{ sub_policies.keys() | join(":") }}}
    </pre>

rationale: |-
    CBC mode ciphers are vulnerable to certain attacks, such as the BEAST attack.
    Disabling CBC mode ciphers helps protect against these attacks and ensures that only
    strong, proven cryptographic algorithms are used to protect SSH communications.
    Weak ciphers that are used for authentication to the cryptographic module cannot be
    relied upon to provide confidentiality or integrity, and system data may be compromised.
    Message Authentication Codes (MACs) are cryptographic mechanisms used to verify the
    integrity and authenticity of data transmitted over SSH connections. Weak MACs that
    are used for authentication to the cryptographic module cannot be relied upon to
    provide integrity, and system data may be compromised. Implementing a custom crypto
    policy that disables weak MAC algorithms helps ensure that only strong, proven
    cryptographic algorithms are used to protect SSH communications.
