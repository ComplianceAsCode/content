title: 'Configure OpenSSL library to use System Crypto Policy'

description: |-
    Crypto Policies provide a centralized control over crypto algorithms usage of many packages.
    OpenSSL is supported by crypto policy, but the OpenSSL configuration may be
    set up to ignore it.
    To check that Crypto Policies settings are configured correctly, you have to examine the OpenSSL config file
    available under <tt>/etc/pki/tls/openssl.cnf</tt>.
    This file has the <tt>ini</tt> format, and it enables crypto policy support
    if there is a <tt>[ crypto_policy ]</tt> section that contains the <tt>.include /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/openssl.config</tt> directive.

rationale: |-
    Overriding the system crypto policy makes the behavior of the Java runtime violates expectations,
    and makes system configuration more fragmented.

ocil_clause: |-
    the OpenSSL config file doesn't contain the whole section,
    or that the section doesn't have the <pre>.include /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/openssl.config</pre> directive

ocil: |-
    To verify that OpenSSL uses the system crypro policy, check out that the OpenSSL config file
    <pre>/etc/pki/tls/openssl.cnf</pre> contains the <pre>[ crypto_policy ]</pre> section with the
    <pre>.include /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/openssl.config</pre> directive:
    <pre>grep '\.include\s* /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/openssl.config$' /etc/pki/tls/openssl.cnf</pre>.
