title: 'Harden OpenSSL Crypto Policy'

description: |-
    Crypto Policies are means of enforcing certain cryptographic settings for
    selected applications including OpenSSL. OpenSSL is by default configured to
    modify its configuration based on currently configured Crypto Policy.
    However, in certain cases it might be needed to override the Crypto Policy
    specific to OpenSSL and leave rest of the Crypto Policy intact. This can
    be done by dropping a file named <tt>opensslcnf-xxx.config</tt>, replacing
    <tt>xxx</tt> with arbitrary identifier, into
    <tt>/etc/crypto-policies/local.d</tt>. This has to be followed by running
    <tt>update-crypto-policies</tt> so that changes are applied. Changes are
    propagated into <tt>/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/opensslcnf.config</tt>.
    This rule checks if this file contains predefined <tt>Ciphersuites</tt>
    variable configured with predefined value.

rationale: |-
    The Common Criteria requirements specify that certain parameters for OpenSSL
    are configured e.g. cipher suites. Currently particular requirements
    specified by CC are stricter compared to any existing Crypto Policy.

ocil_clause: 'Crypto Policy for OpenSSL is not configured according to CC requirements'

ocil: |-
    To verify if the OpenSSL uses defined Crypto Policy, run:
    <pre>$ grep 'Ciphersuites' /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/opensslcnf.config | tail -n 1</pre>
    and verify that the line matches
    <pre>Ciphersuites = TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256:TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256</pre>
