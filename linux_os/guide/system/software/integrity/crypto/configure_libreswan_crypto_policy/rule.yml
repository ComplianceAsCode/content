title: 'Configure Libreswan to use System Crypto Policy'

description: |-
    Crypto Policies provide a centralized control over crypto algorithms usage of many packages.
    Libreswan is supported by system crypto policy, but the Libreswan configuration may be
    set up to ignore it.

    To check that Crypto Policies settings are configured correctly, ensure that the <tt>/etc/ipsec.conf</tt>
    includes the appropriate configuration file.
    In <tt>/etc/ipsec.conf</tt>, make sure that the following line
    is not commented out or superseded by later includes:
    <tt>include /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/libreswan.config</tt>

rationale: |-
    Overriding the system crypto policy makes the behavior of the Libreswan
    service violate expectations, and makes system configuration more
    fragmented.

ocil_clause: |-
    Libreswan is installed and <tt>/etc/ipsec.conf</tt> does not contain <tt>include /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/libreswan.config</tt>

ocil: |-
    To verify that Libreswan uses the system crypto policy, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep include /etc/ipsec.conf</pre>
    The output should return something similar to:
    <pre>include /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/libreswan.config</pre>
