title: 'Configure Libreswan to use System Crypto Policy'

description: |-
    Crypto Policies provide a centralized control over crypto algorithms usage of many packages.
    Libreswan is supported by system crypto policy, but the Libreswan configuration may be
    set up to ignore it.

    To check that Crypto Policies settings are configured correctly, ensure that the <tt>/etc/ipsec.conf</tt>
    includes the appropriate configuration file.
    In <tt>/etc/ipsec.conf</tt>, make sure that the following line
    is not commented out or superseded by later includes:
    <tt>include /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/libreswan.config</tt>

rationale: |-
    Overriding the system crypto policy makes the behavior of the Libreswan
    service violate expectations, and makes system configuration more
    fragmented.

ocil: |-
    Verify that the IPSec service uses the system crypto policy.

    If the ipsec service is not installed is not applicable.

    Check to see if the "IPsec" service is active with the following command:

    $ systemctl status ipsec

    ipsec.service - Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Protocol Daemon for IPsec
    Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/ipsec.service; disabled)
    Active: inactive (dead)

    If the "IPsec" service is active, check to see if it is using the system crypto policy with the following command:

    $ sudo grep include /etc/ipsec.conf /etc/ipsec.d/*.conf

    /etc/ipsec.conf:include /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/libreswan.config


fixtext: |-
    Configure Libreswan to use the system cryptographic policy.

    Add the following line to "/etc/ipsec.conf":
    include /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/libreswan.config
