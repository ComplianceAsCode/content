    {{{ full_name }}} IP tunnels must use FIPS 140-2/140-3 approved cryptographic algorithms.

    Overriding the system crypto policy makes the behavior of the Libreswan
    service violate expectations, and makes system configuration more
    fragmented.

checktext: |-
    Verify that the IPsec service uses the system crypto policy with the following command:

    Note: If the ipsec service is not installed, this requirement is Not Applicable.

    $ sudo grep include /etc/ipsec.conf /etc/ipsec.d/*.conf

    /etc/ipsec.conf:include /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/libreswan.config

    If the ipsec configuration file does not contain "include /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/libreswan.config", this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure Libreswan to use the system cryptographic policy.

    Add the following line to "/etc/ipsec.conf":

    include /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/libreswan.config
