    {{{ full_name }}} IP tunnels must use FIPS 140-2/3 approved cryptographic algorithms.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Overriding the system crypto policy makes the behavior of the Libreswan
    service violate expectations, and makes system configuration more
    fragmented.

checktext: |-
    Verify that the IPSec service uses the system crypto policy with the following command:

    Note: If the ipsec service is not installed this requirement is Not Applicable.

    $ systemctl status ipsec

    ipsec.service - Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Protocol Daemon for IPsec
    Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/ipsec.service; disabled)
    Active: inactive (dead)

    If the "IPsec" service is active, check to see if it is using the system crypto policy with the following command:

    $ sudo grep include /etc/ipsec.conf /etc/ipsec.d/*.conf

    /etc/ipsec.conf:include /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/libreswan.config

    If the "IPsec" service is active and the ipsec configuration file does not contain "include /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/libreswan.config", this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure Libreswan to use the system cryptographic policy.

    Add the following line to "/etc/ipsec.conf":

    include /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/libreswan.config
