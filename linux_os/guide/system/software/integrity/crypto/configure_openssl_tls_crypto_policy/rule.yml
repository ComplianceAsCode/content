title: 'Configure OpenSSL library to use TLS Encryption'

description: |-
    Crypto Policies are means of enforcing certain cryptographic settings for
    selected applications including OpenSSL. OpenSSL is by default configured to
    modify its configuration based on currently configured Crypto Policy.
    However, in certain cases it might be needed to override the Crypto Policy
    specific to OpenSSL and leave rest of the Crypto Policy intact.

rationale: |-
    Without cryptographic integrity protections, information can be altered by
    unauthorized users without detection.

ocil_clause: 'cryptographic policy for openssl is not configured or is configured incorrectly'

ocil: |-
    To verify if the OpenSSL uses defined TLS Crypto Policy, run:
    <pre>$ grep 'MinProtocol' /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/opensslcnf.config | tail -n 1</pre>
    and verify that the line matches
    <pre>MinProtocol = TLSv1.2</pre>
