title: 'Configure OpenSSL library to use TLS Encryption'

description: |-
    Crypto Policies are means of enforcing certain cryptographic settings for
    selected applications including OpenSSL. OpenSSL is by default configured to
    modify its configuration based on currently configured Crypto Policy.
    Editing the Crypto Policy back-end is not recommended.

    Check the crypto-policies(7) man page and choose a policy that configures TLS
    protocol to version 1.2 or higher, for example DEFAULT, FUTURE or FIPS policy.
    Or create and apply a custom policy that restricts minimum TLS version to 1.2.

rationale: |-
    Without cryptographic integrity protections, information can be altered by
    unauthorized users without detection.

ocil_clause: 'cryptographic policy for openssl is not configured or is configured incorrectly'

ocil: |-
    To verify if the OpenSSL uses defined TLS Crypto Policy, run:
    <pre>$ grep -P '^(TLS\.)?MinProtocol' /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/opensslcnf.config</pre>
    and verify that the value is
    <pre>TLSv1.2</pre>

warnings:
    - general: |-
        This rule doesn't come with a remediation, automatically changing the crypto-policies may be too disruptive.
        Ensure the variable <tt>xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_value_var_system_crypto_policy</tt> is set to a
        Crypto Policy that satisfies OpenSSL minimum TLS protocol version 1.2. Custom policies may be applied too.
