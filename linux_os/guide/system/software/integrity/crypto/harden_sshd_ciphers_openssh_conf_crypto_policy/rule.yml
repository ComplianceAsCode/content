title: 'Configure SSH Client to Use FIPS 140-2 Validated Ciphers: openssh.config'

description: |-
    Crypto Policies provide a centralized control over crypto algorithms usage of many packages.
    OpenSSH is supported by system crypto policy, but the OpenSSH configuration may be
    set up incorrectly.

    To check that Crypto Policies settings for ciphers are configured correctly, ensure that
    <tt>/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/openssh.config</tt> contains the following
    line and is not commented out:
    <pre>Ciphers {{{ xccdf_value("sshd_approved_ciphers") }}}</pre>

rationale: |-
    Overriding the system crypto policy makes the behavior of the OpenSSH client
    violate expectations, and makes system configuration more fragmented. By
    specifying a cipher list with the order of ciphers being in a “strongest to
    weakest” orientation, the system will automatically attempt to use the
    strongest cipher for securing SSH connections.

ocil_clause: 'Crypto Policy for OpenSSH client is not configured correctly'

ocil: |-
    To verify if the OpenSSH client uses defined Cipher suite in the Crypto Policy, run:
    <pre>$ grep -i ciphers /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/openssh.config</pre>
    and verify that the line matches:
    <pre>Ciphers {{{ xccdf_value("sshd_approved_ciphers") }}}</pre>

warnings:
    - general: |-
        The system needs to be rebooted for these changes to take effect.
    - regulatory: |-
        System Crypto Modules must be provided by a vendor that undergoes
        FIPS-140 certifications.
        FIPS-140 is applicable to all Federal agencies that use
        cryptographic-based security systems to protect sensitive information
        in computer and telecommunication systems (including voice systems) as
        defined in Section 5131 of the Information Technology Management Reform
        Act of 1996, Public Law 104-106. This standard shall be used in
        designing and implementing cryptographic modules that Federal
        departments and agencies operate or are operated for them under
        contract. See <b>{{{ weblink(link="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf") }}}</b>
        To meet this, the system has to have cryptographic software provided by
        a vendor that has undergone this certification. This means providing
        documentation, test results, design information, and independent third
        party review by an accredited lab. While open source software is
        capable of meeting this, it does not meet FIPS-140 unless the vendor
        submits to this process.
