title: 'OpenSSL uses strong entropy source'

description: |-
    By default, OpenSSL doesn't always use a SP800-90A compliant random number generator.
    A way to configure OpenSSL to always use a strong source is to setup a wrapper that
    defines a shell function that shadows the actual <tt>openssl</tt> binary,
    and that ensures that the <tt>-rand /dev/random</tt> option is added to every <tt>openssl</tt> invocation.

    To do so, place the following shell snippet exactly as-is to <tt>/etc/profile.d/openssl-rand.sh</tt>:
    <pre>
    {{{ openssl_strong_entropy_config_file() | indent(4) }}}
    </pre>

rationale: |-
    This rule ensures that <tt>openssl</tt> invocations always uses SP800-90A compliant random number generator as a default behavior.

ocil: |-
    To determine whether OpenSSL is wrapped by a shell function that ensures that every invocation
    uses a SP800-90A compliant entropy source,
    make sure that the <tt>/etc/profile.d/openssl-rand.sh</tt> file contents exactly match those
    that are included in the rule's description.

ocil_clause: |-
    there is no <tt>/etc/profile.d/openssl-rand.sh</tt> file, or its contents don't match those in the description

warnings:
    - general: "This setting can cause problems on computers without the hardware random generator, because insufficient entropy blocks the program until enough entropy is available."
