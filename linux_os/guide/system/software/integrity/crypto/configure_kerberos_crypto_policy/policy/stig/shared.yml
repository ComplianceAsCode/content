    Overriding the system crypto policy makes the behavior of Kerberos violate expectations, and makes system configuration more fragmented.

checktext: |-
    Verify that the symlink exists and targets the correct Kerberos crypto policy, with the following command:

    file /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/krb5.config

    If command output shows the following line, Kerberos is configured to use the system-wide crypto policy:

    /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/krb5.config: symbolic link to /usr/share/crypto-policies/FIPS/krb5.txt

    If the symlink does not exist or points to a different target, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure Kerberos to use system crypto policy.

    Create a symlink pointing to system crypto policy in the Kerberos configuration using the following command:

    $ sudo ln -s /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/krb5.config /usr/share/crypto-policies/FIPS/krb5.txt
