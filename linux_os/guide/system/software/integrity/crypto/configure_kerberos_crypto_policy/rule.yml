title: 'Configure Kerberos to use System Crypto Policy'

description: |-
    Crypto Policies provide a centralized control over crypto algorithms usage of many packages.
    Kerberos is supported by crypto policy, but it's configuration may be
    set up to ignore it.
    To check that Crypto Policies settings for Kerberos are configured correctly, examine that there is a symlink at
    /etc/krb5.conf.d/crypto-policies targeting /etc/cypto-policies/back-ends/krb5.config.
    If the symlink exists, Kerberos is configured to use the system-wide crypto policy settings.

rationale: |-
    Overriding the system crypto policy makes the behavior of Kerberos violate expectations,
    and makes system configuration more fragmented.

ocil: |-
    Check that the symlink exists and target the correct Kerberos crypto policy, with the following command:
    <pre>file /etc/krb5.conf.d/crypto-policies</pre>
    If command ouput shows the following line, Kerberos is configured to use the system-wide crypto policy.
    <pre>/etc/krb5.conf.d/crypto-policies: symbolic link to /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/krb5.config</pre>

fixtext: |-
    Configure Kerberos to use system crypto policy.
    Create a symlink pointing to system crypto policy in the Kerberos configuration using the following command:
    $ sudo ln -s /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/krb5.config /etc/krb5.conf.d/crypto-policies
