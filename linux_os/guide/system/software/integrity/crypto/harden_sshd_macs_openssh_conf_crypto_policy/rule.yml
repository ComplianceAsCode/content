title: 'Configure SSH Daemon to Use FIPS 140-2 Validated MACs: openssh.config'

description: |-
    Crypto Policies provide a centralized control over crypto algorithms usage of many packages.
    OpenSSH is supported by system crypto policy, but the OpenSSH configuration may be
    set up incorrectly.

    To check that Crypto Policies settings are configured correctly, ensure that
    <tt>/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/openssh.config</tt> contains the following
    line and is not commented out:
    <tt>MACs hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha2-256</tt>

rationale: |-
    Overriding the system crypto policy makes the behavior of the OpenSSH
    daemon violate expectations, and makes system configuration more
    fragmented.

ocil_clause: 'Crypto Policy for OpenSSH Server is not configured correctly'

ocil: |-
    To verify if the OpenSSH daemon uses defined MACs in the Crypto Policy, run:
    <pre>$ grep -i macs /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/openssh.config</pre>
    and verify that the line matches:
    <pre>MACs hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha2-256</pre>

        The system needs to be rebooted for these changes to take effect.
    - regulatory: |-
        System Crypto Modules must be provided by a vendor that undergoes
        FIPS-140 certifications.
        FIPS-140 is applicable to all Federal agencies that use
        cryptographic-based security systems to protect sensitive information
        in computer and telecommunication systems (including voice systems) as
        defined in Section 5131 of the Information Technology Management Reform
        Act of 1996, Public Law 104-106. This standard shall be used in
        designing and implementing cryptographic modules that Federal
        departments and agencies operate or are operated for them under
        contract. See <b>{{{ weblink(link="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf") }}}</b>
        To meet this, the system has to have cryptographic software provided by
        a vendor that has undergone this certification. This means providing
        documentation, test results, design information, and independent third
        party review by an accredited lab. While open source software is
        capable of meeting this, it does not meet FIPS-140 unless the vendor
        submits to this process.
