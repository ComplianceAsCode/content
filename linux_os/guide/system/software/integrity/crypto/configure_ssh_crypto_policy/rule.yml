title: 'Configure SSH to use System Crypto Policy'

description: |-
    Crypto Policies provide a centralized control over crypto algorithms usage of many packages.
    SSH is supported by crypto policy, but the SSH configuration may be
    set up to ignore it.
    To check that Crypto Policies settings are configured correctly, ensure that
    the <tt>CRYPTO_POLICY</tt> variable is either commented or not set at all
    in the <tt>/etc/sysconfig/sshd</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Overriding the system crypto policy makes the behavior of the SSH service violate expectations,
    and makes system configuration more fragmented.
