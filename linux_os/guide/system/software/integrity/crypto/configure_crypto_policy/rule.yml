title: 'Configure System Cryptography Policy'

description: |-
    To configure the system cryptography policy to use ciphers only from the <tt><sub idref="var_system_crypto_policy" /></tt>
    policy, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo update-crypto-policies --set <sub idref="var_system_crypto_policy" /></pre>
    The rule checks if settings for selected crypto policy are configured as expected. Configuration files in the <tt>/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends</tt> are either symlinks to correct files provided by Crypto-policies package or they are regular files in case crypto policy customizations are applied.

rationale: |-
    Centralized cryptographic policies simplify applying secure ciphers across an operating system and
    the applications that run on that operating system. Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms
    undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption to protect data.

ocil_clause: 'cryptographic policy is not configured or is configured incorrectly'

ocil: |-
    To verify that cryptography policy has been configured correctly, run the
    following command:
    <pre>$ update-crypto-policies --show</pre>
    The output should return <pre><sub idref="var_system_crypto_policy" /></pre>.
    Run the command to check if the policy is correctly applied:
    <pre>$ update-crypto-policies --is-applied</pre>
    The output should be <pre>The configured policy is applied</pre>.
    Moreover, check if settings for selected crypto policy are as expected.
    List all libraries for which it holds that their crypto policies do not have symbolic link in <pre>/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends</pre>.
    <pre>$ ls -l /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/ | grep '^[^l]' | tail -n +2 | awk -F' ' '{print $NF}' | awk -F'.' '{print $1}' | sort</pre>
    Subsequently, check if matching libraries have drop in files in the <pre>/etc/crypto-policies/local.d</pre> directory.
    <pre>$ ls /etc/crypto-policies/local.d/ | awk -F'-' '{print $1}' | uniq | sort</pre>
    Outputs of two previous commands should match.
    Now check if all symbolic links from the <pre>/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/</pre> are pointing into the <pre>/usr/share/crypto-policies/<sub idref="var_system_crypto_policy" /></pre> directory.
    <pre>$ find /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/ -type l -ls | grep -v '/usr/share/crypto-policies/<sub idref="var_system_crypto_policy" />'</pre>
    No output is expected.

        The Federal Information Systems Modernization Act (FISMA), requires cryptography protecting sensitive
        or valuable data to undergo FIPS 140 validation. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and
        Technology (NIST) views unvalidated cryptography as providing no protection to the information or
        dataâ€”in effect the data would be considered unprotected plaintext. If the agency specifies that the
        information or data be cryptographically protected, FIPS 140 is applicable. This configuration
        check will fail on platforms lacking FIPS 140 validation, such as the CentOS, Scientific Linux,
        and Fedora projects, even if FIPS-approved ciphers can be installed and enabled.
