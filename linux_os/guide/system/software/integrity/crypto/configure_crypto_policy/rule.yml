title: 'Configure System Cryptography Policy'

description: |-
    To configure the system cyptography policy to use ciphers only from the <tt><sub idref="var_system_crypto_policy" /></tt>
    policy, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo update-crypto-policies --set <sub idref="var_system_crypto_policy" /></pre>

rationale: |-
    Centralized cryptographic policies simplify applying secure ciphers across an operating system and
    the applications that run on that operating system. Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms
    undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption to protect data.

ocil_clause: 'cryptographic policy is not configured or is configured incorrectly'

ocil: |-
    To verify that cryptography policy has been configured correctly, run the
    following command:
    <pre>$ update-crypto-policies --show</pre>
    The output should return <pre><sub idref="var_system_crypto_policy" /></pre>.
