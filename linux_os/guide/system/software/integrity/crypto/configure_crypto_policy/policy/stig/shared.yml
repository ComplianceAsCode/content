srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must implement a system-wide encryption policy.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Centralized cryptographic policies simplify applying secure ciphers across an operating system and
    the applications that run on that operating system. Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms
    undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption to protect data.

checktext: |-
    Verify that the {{{ full_name }}} cryptography policy has been configured correctly with the following commands:

    $ sudo update-crypto-policies --show

    FIPS

    If the cryptography is not set to "FIPS" and is not applied, this is a finding.

    $ sudo update-crypto-policies --check

    The configured policy is applied.

    If the command does not return "The configured policy is applied.", this is a finding.



fixtext: |-
    Configure the operating system to implement FIPS mode with the following command

    $ sudo fips-mode-setup --enable

    Reboot the system for the changes to take effect.
