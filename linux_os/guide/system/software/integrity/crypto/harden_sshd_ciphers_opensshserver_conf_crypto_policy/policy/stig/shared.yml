    {{{ full_name }}} must implement DoD-approved encryption ciphers to protect the confidentiality of SSH server connections.

    Without cryptographic integrity protections, information can be altered by unauthorized users without detection.

    Remote access (e.g., RDP) is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

    Cryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of information include, for example, signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography enabling distribution of the public key to verify the hash information while maintaining the confidentiality of the secret key used to generate the hash.

    {{{ full_name }}} incorporates system-wide crypto policies by default. The SSH configuration file has no effect on the ciphers, MACs, or algorithms unless specifically defined in the /etc/sysconfig/sshd file. The employed algorithms can be viewed in the /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/opensshserver.config file.

    Verify the SSH server is configured to use only ciphers employing FIPS 140-3 approved algorithms with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -i ciphers /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/opensshserver.config

    Ciphers aes256-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-ctr,aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes128-ctr

    If the cipher entries in the "opensshserver.config" file have any ciphers other than "aes256-gcm@openssh.com", "aes256-ctr", "aes128-gcm@openssh.com", "aes128-ctr", the order differs from the example above, they are missing, or commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Reinstall the crypto-policies package to remove any modifications.

    $ sudo dnf reinstall crypto-policies

    Then ensure that FIPS mode is setup with the following command:

    $ sudo fips-mode-setup --enable

    The system must be rebooted for the changes to take effect.
    A reboot is required for the changes to take effect.
