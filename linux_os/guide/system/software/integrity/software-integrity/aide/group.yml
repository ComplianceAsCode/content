title: 'Verify Integrity with AIDE'

description: |-
    AIDE conducts integrity checks by comparing information about
    files with previously-gathered information. Ideally, the AIDE database is
    created immediately after initial system configuration, and then again after any
    software update.  AIDE is highly configurable, with further configuration
    information located in <tt>/usr/share/doc/aide-<i>VERSION</i></tt>.
