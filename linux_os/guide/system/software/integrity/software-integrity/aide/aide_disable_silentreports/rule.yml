title: 'Configure AIDE To Notify Personnel if Baseline Configurations Are Altered'

description: |-
    The operating system file integrity tool must be configured to notify designated personnel of any changes to configurations.

rationale: |-
    Detecting changes in the system can help avoid unintended, and negative consequences
    that could affect the security state of the operating system

severity: medium

    Verify that Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) notifies the System Administrator
    when anomalies in the operation of any security functions are discovered with the following command:
    <pre># grep SILENTREPORTS {{{ aide_default_path }}} </pre>

    SILENTREPORTS=no

    If SILENTREPORTS is commented out, this is a finding.

    If SILENTREPORTS is set to "yes", this is a finding.

    If SILENTREPORTS is not set to "no", this is a finding.
