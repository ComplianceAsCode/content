title: 'Configure AIDE to Verify the Audit Tools'

description: |-
    The operating system file integrity tool must be configured to protect the integrity of the audit tools.

rationale: |-
    Protecting the integrity of the tools used for auditing purposes is a
    critical step toward ensuring the integrity of audit information. Audit
    information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings,
    and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system
    activity.

    Audit tools include but are not limited to vendor-provided and open-source
    audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information
    system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report
    generators.

    It is not uncommon for attackers to replace the audit tools or inject code
    into the existing tools to provide the capability to hide or erase system
    activity from the audit logs.

    To address this risk, audit tools must be cryptographically signed to
    provide the capability to identify when the audit tools have been modified,
    manipulated, or replaced. An example is a checksum hash of the file or
    files.

ocil_clause: 'integrity checks of the audit tools are missing or incomplete'

ocil: |-
    Check that AIDE is properly configured to protect the integrity of the
    audit tools by running the following command:

    <pre># sudo cat {{{ aide_conf_path }}} | grep /usr/sbin/au

    {{{ aide_files() }}}
    </pre>
    If AIDE is configured properly to protect the integrity of the audit tools,
    all lines listed above will be returned from the command.

    If one or more lines are missing, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Add or update the following lines to "/etc/aide.conf", to protect the integrity of the audit tools.

    <pre>
    {{{ aide_files() }}}
    </pre>

srg_requirement:
    {{{ full_name }}} must use cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity of audit tools.
