    Protecting the integrity of the tools used for auditing purposes is a
    critical step toward ensuring the integrity of audit information. Audit
    information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings,
    and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system
    activity.

    Audit tools include, but are not limited to, vendor-provided and open-source
    audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information
    system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report
    generators.

    It is not uncommon for attackers to replace the audit tools or inject code
    into the existing tools to provide the capability to hide or erase system
    activity from the audit logs.

    To address this risk, audit tools must be cryptographically signed to
    provide the capability to identify when the audit tools have been modified,
    manipulated, or replaced. An example is a checksum hash of the file or
    files.

    Check that AIDE is properly configured to protect the integrity of the audit tools with the following command:

     $ sudo cat /etc/aide.conf | grep /usr/sbin/au

    /usr/sbin/auditctl p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512
    /usr/sbin/auditd p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512
    /usr/sbin/ausearch p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512
    /usr/sbin/aureport p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512
    /usr/sbin/autrace p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512
    /usr/sbin/autrace p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512
    /usr/sbin/augenrules p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512

    If AIDE is not installed, ask the System Administrator how file integrity checks are performed on the system.

    If any of the audit tools listed above do not have a corresponding line, ask the System Administrator to indicate what cryptographic mechanisms are being used to protect the integrity of the audit tools.  If there is no evidence of integrity protection, this is a finding.

    Add or update the following lines to "/etc/aide.conf", to protect the integrity of the audit tools.

    /usr/sbin/auditctl p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512
    /usr/sbin/auditd p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512
    /usr/sbin/ausearch p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512

    /usr/sbin/autrace p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512
    /usr/sbin/autrace p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512
