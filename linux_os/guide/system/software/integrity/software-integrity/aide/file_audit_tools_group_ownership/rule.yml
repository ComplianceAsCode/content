title: Audit Tools Must Be Group-owned by Root

description: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} systems providing tools to interface with audit information will leverage user permissions and roles identifying the user accessing the tools, and the corresponding rights the user enjoys, to make access decisions regarding the access to audit tools.

    Audit tools include, but are not limited to, vendor-provided and open source audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report generators.

    Audit tools must have the correct group owner.

rationale: |-
    Protecting audit information also includes identifying and protecting the tools used to view and manipulate log data.
    Therefore, protecting audit tools is necessary to prevent unauthorized operations on audit information.

ocil_clause: 'any audit tools are not group-owned by root'

ocil: |-
    Verify the audit tools are group-owned by "root" to prevent any unauthorized access, deletion, or modification.

    Check the group-owner of each audit tool by running the following command:

    $ sudo stat -c "%G %n" /sbin/auditctl /sbin/aureport /sbin/ausearch /sbin/autrace /sbin/auditd /sbin/rsyslogd /sbin/augenrules

    root /sbin/auditctl
    root /sbin/aureport
    root /sbin/ausearch
    root /sbin/autrace
    root /sbin/auditd
    root /sbin/rsyslogd
    root /sbin/augenrules

fixtext: |-
    Configure the audit tools to be group-owned by "root", by running the following command:

    $ sudo chgrp root [audit_tool]

    Replace "[audit_tool]" with each audit tool not group-owned by "root".
