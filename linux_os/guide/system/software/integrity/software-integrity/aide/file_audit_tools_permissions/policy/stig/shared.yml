    {{{ full_name }}} audit tools must have a mode of 0755 or less permissive.

    Protecting audit information also includes identifying and protecting the tools used to view and manipulate log data. Therefore, protecting audit tools is necessary to prevent unauthorized operation on audit information.

    {{{ full_name }}} systems providing tools to interface with audit information will leverage user permissions and roles identifying the user accessing the tools, and the corresponding rights the user enjoys, to make access decisions regarding the access to audit tools.

    Audit tools include, but are not limited to, vendor-provided and open source audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report generators.

    Verify the audit tools have a mode of "0755" or less with the following command:

    $ stat -c "%a %n" /sbin/auditctl /sbin/aureport /sbin/ausearch /sbin/autrace /sbin/auditd /sbin/rsyslogd /sbin/augenrules

    755 /sbin/auditctl
    755 /sbin/aureport
    755 /sbin/ausearch
    750 /sbin/autrace
    755 /sbin/auditd
    755 /sbin/rsyslogd
    755 /sbin/augenrules

    If any of the audit tool files have a mode more permissive than "0755", this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the audit tools to have a mode of "0755"  by running the following command:

    $ sudo chmod 0755 [audit_tool]

    Replace "[audit_tool]" with each audit tool that has a more permissive mode than 0755.
