title: 'Configure AIDE to Use FIPS 140-2 for Validating Hashes'

description: |-
    By default, the <tt>sha512</tt> option is added to the <tt>NORMAL</tt> ruleset in AIDE.
    If using a custom ruleset or the <tt>sha512</tt> option is missing, add <tt>sha512</tt>
    to the appropriate ruleset.
    For example, add <tt>sha512</tt> to the following line in <tt>/etc/aide.conf</tt>:
    <pre>NORMAL = FIPSR+sha512</pre>
    AIDE rules can be configured in multiple ways; this is merely one example that is already
    configured by default.

rationale: |-
    File integrity tools use cryptographic hashes for verifying file contents and directories
    have not been altered. These hashes must be FIPS 140-2 approved cryptographic hashes.

ocil_clause: 'the sha512 option is missing or not added to the correct ruleset'

ocil: |-
    To determine that AIDE is configured for FIPS 140-2 file hashing, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep sha512 /etc/aide.conf</pre>
    Verify that the <tt>sha512</tt> option is added to the correct ruleset.
