title: 'Configure AIDE to Use FIPS 140-2 for Validating Hashes'

description: |-
    By default, the <tt>sha512</tt> option is added to the <tt>NORMAL</tt> ruleset in AIDE.
    If using a custom ruleset or the <tt>sha512</tt> option is missing, add <tt>sha512</tt>
    to the appropriate ruleset.
    For example, add <tt>sha512</tt> to the following line in <tt>/etc/aide.conf</tt>:
    <pre>NORMAL = FIPSR+sha512</pre>
    AIDE rules can be configured in multiple ways; this is merely one example that is already
    configured by default.

rationale: |-
    File integrity tools use cryptographic hashes for verifying file contents and directories
    have not been altered. These hashes must be FIPS 140-2 approved cryptographic hashes.

ocil_clause: 'the sha512 option is missing or not added to the correct ruleset'

ocil: |-
    To determine that AIDE is configured for FIPS 140-2 file hashing, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep sha512 /etc/aide.conf</pre>
    Verify that the <tt>sha512</tt> option is added to the correct ruleset.

        System Crypto Modules must be provided by a vendor that undergoes
        FIPS-140 certifications.
        FIPS-140 is applicable to all Federal agencies that use
        cryptographic-based security systems to protect sensitive information
        in computer and telecommunication systems (including voice systems) as
        defined in Section 5131 of the Information Technology Management Reform
        Act of 1996, Public Law 104-106. This standard shall be used in
        designing and implementing cryptographic modules that Federal
        departments and agencies operate or are operated for them under
        contract. See <b>{{{ weblink(link="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.140-2.pdf") }}}</b>
        To meet this, the system has to have cryptographic software provided by
        a vendor that has undergone this certification. This means providing
        documentation, test results, design information, and independent third
        party review by an accredited lab. While open source software is
        capable of meeting this, it does not meet FIPS-140 unless the vendor
        submits to this process.
