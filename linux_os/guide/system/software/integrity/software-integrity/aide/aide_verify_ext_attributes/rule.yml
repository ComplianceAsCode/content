title: 'Configure AIDE to Verify Extended Attributes'

description: |-
    By default, the <tt>xattrs</tt> option is added to the <tt>FIPSR</tt> ruleset in AIDE.
    If using a custom ruleset or the <tt>xattrs</tt> option is missing, add <tt>xattrs</tt>
    to the appropriate ruleset.
    For example, add <tt>xattrs</tt> to the following line in <tt>/etc/aide.conf</tt>:
    <pre>FIPSR = p+i+n+u+g+s+m+c+acl+selinux+xattrs+sha256</pre>
    AIDE rules can be configured in multiple ways; this is merely one example that is already
    configured by default.

rationale: |-
    Extended attributes in file systems are used to contain arbitrary data and file metadata
    with security implications.

ocil_clause: 'the xattrs option is missing or not added to the correct ruleset'

ocil: |-
    To determine that AIDE is verifying extended file attributes, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep xattrs /etc/aide.conf</pre>
    Verify that the <tt>xattrs</tt> option is added to the correct ruleset.
