title: 'Software Integrity Checking'

description: |-
    Both the AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment)
    software and the RPM package management system provide
    mechanisms for verifying the integrity of installed software.
    AIDE uses snapshots of file metadata (such as hashes) and compares these
    to current system files in order to detect changes.
    <br /><br />
    The RPM package management system can conduct integrity
    checks by comparing information in its metadata database with
    files installed on the system.
