    The hashes of important files like system executables should match the
    information given by the RPM database. Executables with erroneous hashes could
    be a sign of nefarious activity on the system.

checktext: |-
    The following command will list which files on the system
    have file hashes different from what is expected by the RPM database.
     $ rpm -Va --noconfig | awk '$1 ~ /..5/ && $2 != "c"'

    If there is output, then this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Given output from the check command, identify the package that provides the output and reinstall it. The following trimmed example output shows a package that has failed verification, been identified, and been reinstalled:

    $ rpm -Va --noconfig | awk '$1 ~ /..5/ && $2 != "c"'
    S.5....T.    /usr/bin/znew
    $ sudo dnf provides /usr/bin/znew
    [...]
    gzip-1.10-8.el9.x86_64 : The GNU data compression program
    [...]
    $ sudo dnf reinstall gzip
    [...]
    $ rpm -Va --noconfig | awk '$1 ~ /..5/ && $2 != "c"'
    [no output]
