title: 'Verify File Hashes with RPM'

description: |-
    Without cryptographic integrity protections, system executables and files can be altered by
    unauthorized users without detection. The RPM package management system can check the hashes
    of installed software packages, including many that are important to system security.

    To verify that the cryptographic hash of system files and commands matches vendor values, run
    the following command to list which files on the system have hashes that differ from what is
    expected by the RPM database:
    <pre>$ rpm -Va --noconfig | grep '^..5'</pre>

    If the file was not expected to change, investigate the cause of the change using audit logs
    or other means. The package can then be reinstalled to restore the file. Run the following
    command to determine which package owns the file:
    <pre>$ rpm -qf <i>FILENAME</i></pre>

    The package can be reinstalled from a {{{ pkg_manager }}} repository using the command:
    <pre>$ sudo {{{ pkg_manager }}} reinstall <i>PACKAGENAME</i></pre>

    Alternatively, the package can be reinstalled from trusted media using the command:
    <pre>$ sudo rpm -Uvh <i>PACKAGENAME</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    The hashes of important files like system executables should match the
    information given by the RPM database. Executables with erroneous hashes could
    be a sign of nefarious activity on the system.

    The following command will list which files on the system have file hashes different from what
    is expected by the RPM database.
    <pre>$ rpm -Va --noconfig | awk '$1 ~ /..5/'</pre>

fixtext: |-
    Run the following command to determine which package owns the file:

    $ rpm -qf [FILE]

    The package can be reinstalled from a repository using the command:

    $ sudo {{{ pkg_manager }}} reinstall [PACKAGE]

    Alternatively, the package can be reinstalled from trusted media using the command:

    $ sudo rpm -Uvh [PATH TO RPM]

srg_requirement: '{{{ full_name }}} must be configured so that the cryptographic hash of system files and commands matches vendor values.'

warnings:
    - general: |-
        This rule can take a long time to perform the check and might consume a considerable
        amount of resources depending on the number of packages present on the system. It is not a
        problem in most cases, but especially systems with a large number of installed packages
        can be affected.
