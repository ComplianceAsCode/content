title: 'Verify crypto-policies with RPM'

description: |-
    Without cryptographic integrity protections, system executables and files can be altered by
    unauthorized users without detection. The RPM package management system can check the hashes
    of installed software packages, including many that are important to system security.

    If the file was not expected to change, investigate the cause of the change using audit logs
    or other means. The package can then be reinstalled to restore the file. Run the following
    command to determine which package owns the file:
    <pre>$ rpm -qf <i>FILENAME</i></pre>

    The package can be reinstalled from a {{{ pkg_manager }}} repository using the command:
    <pre>$ sudo {{{ pkg_manager }}} reinstall crypto-policies</pre>

rationale: |-
    The crypto-policies package defines the cryptography policies for the system.
    If the files are changed from those shipped with the operating system, 
    It may be possible for {{{ full_name }}} to use cryptographic functions that are not FIPS 140-3 approved.

ocil_clause: 'there is output'

ocil: |-
    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} crypto-policies package has not been modified with the following command:
    $ rpm -V crypto-policies
    If the command has any output, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Reinstall the crypto-policies package to remove any modifications.
    $ sudo {{{ pkg_manager }}} reinstall -y crypto-policies
