title: 'Ensure /dev/shm is configured'

description: |-
    The <tt>/dev/shm</tt> is a traditional shared memory concept.
    One program will create a memory portion, which other processes
    (if permitted) can access. If <tt>/dev/shm</tt> is not configured,
    tmpfs will be mounted to /dev/shm by systemd.

rationale: |-
    Any user can upload and execute files inside the <tt>/dev/shm</tt> similar to
    the <tt>/tmp</tt> partition. Configuring <tt>/dev/shm</tt> allows an administrator
    to set the noexec option on the mount, making /dev/shm useless for an attacker to
    install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a
    hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program
    was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy
    of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker
    could continue to exploit the known flaw.

warnings:
- general: |-
    This rule does not have a remedation.
    It is expected that this will be managed by systemd and will be a tmpfs partition.
