    {{{ full_name }}} must use a separate file system for /var/tmp.

vuldiscussion: |-
    The "/var/tmp" partition is used as temporary storage by many programs.
    Placing "/var/tmp" in its own partition enables the setting of more
    restrictive mount options, which can help protect programs which use it.

checktext: |-
    Verify that a separate file system/partition has been created for "/var/tmp" with the following command:

    $ mount | grep /var/tmp

    UUID=c274f65f-c5b5-4379-b017-bee96feb7a34 /var/log xfs noatime,nobarrier 1 2

    If a separate entry for "/var/tmp" is not in use, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Migrate the "/var/tmp" path onto a separate file system.
