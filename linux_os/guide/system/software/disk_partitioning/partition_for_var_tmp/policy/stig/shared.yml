    {{{ full_name }}} must use a separate file system for /var/tmp.

vuldiscussion: |-
    The "/var/tmp" partition is used as temporary storage by many programs.
    Placing "/var/tmp" in its own partition enables the setting of more
    restrictive mount options, which can help protect programs which use it.

checktext: |-
    Verify that a separate file system/partition has been created for  /var/tmp  with the following command:

     $ mountpoint /var/tmp


    If "/var/tmp is is not a mountpoint" is returned, then this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Migrate the "/var/tmp" path onto a separate file system.
