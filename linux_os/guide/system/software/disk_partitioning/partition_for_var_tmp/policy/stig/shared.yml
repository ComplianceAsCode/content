    {{{ full_name }}} must use a separate file system for /var/tmp.

vuldiscussion: |-
    The "/var/tmp" partition is used as temporary storage by many programs. Placing "/var/tmp" in its own partition enables the setting of more restrictive mount options, which can help protect programs that use it.

checktext: |-
    Verify that a separate file system/partition has been created for "/var/tmp" with the following command:

    $ mount | grep /var/tmp

    /dev/mapper/rhel-tmp on /var/tmp type xfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,seclabel,attr2,inode64,logbufs=8,logbsize=32k)
    Note: Options displayed for mount may differ.

    If a separate entry for "/var/tmp" is not in use, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Migrate the "/var/tmp" path onto a separate file system.
