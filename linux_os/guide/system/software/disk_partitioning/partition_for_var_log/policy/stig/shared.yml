    {{{ full_name }}} must use a separate file system for /var/log.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Placing "/var/log" in its own partition enables better separation between log files and other files in "/var/".

checktext: |-
    Verify that a separate file system/partition has been created for "/var/log" with the following command:

    $ mount | grep /var/log

    /dev/mapper/rhel-var_log on /var/log type xfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,seclabel,attr2,inode64,logbufs=8,logbsize=32k)
    Note: Options displayed for mount may differ.

    If a separate entry for "/var/log" is not in use, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Migrate the "/var/log" path onto a separate file system.
