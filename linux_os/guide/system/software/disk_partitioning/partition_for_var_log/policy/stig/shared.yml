    {{{ full_name }}} must use a separate file system for /var/log.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Placing "/var/log" in its own partition
    enables better separation between log files
    and other files in "/var/".

checktext: |-
    Verify that a separate file system/partition has been created for "/var/log" with the following command:

    $ mount | grep /var/log

    UUID=c274f65f-c5b5-4486-b021-bee96feb8b21 /var/log xfs noatime,nobarrier 1 2

    If a separate entry for "/var/log" is not in use, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Migrate the "/var/log" path onto a separate file system.
