title: 'Ensure /var/log Located On Separate Partition'

description: |-
    System logs are stored in the <tt>/var/log</tt> directory.
    Ensure that it has its own partition or logical
    volume at installation time, or migrate it using LVM.

rationale: |-
    Placing <tt>/var/log</tt> in its own partition
    enables better separation between log files
    and other files in <tt>/var/</tt>.
