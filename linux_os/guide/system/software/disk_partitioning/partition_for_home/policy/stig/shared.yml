srg_requirement: |-
    A separate {{{ full_name }}} filesystem must be used for user home directories (such as /home or an equivalent).

vuldiscussion: |-
    Ensuring that "/home" is mounted on its own partition enables the
    setting of more restrictive mount options, and also helps ensure that
    users cannot trivially fill partitions used for log or audit data storage.

checktext: |-
    Verify that a separate file system/partition has been created for  /home  with the following command:

     $ mountpoint /home


    If "/home is is not a mountpoint" is returned, then this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Migrate the "/home" directory onto a separate file system.
