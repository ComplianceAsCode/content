title: 'Ensure /srv Located On Separate Partition'

description: |-
    If a file server (FTP, TFTP...) is hosted locally, create a separate partition
    for <tt>/srv</tt> at installation time (or migrate it later using LVM). If
    <tt>/srv</tt> will be mounted from another system such as an NFS server, then
    creating a separate partition is not necessary at installation time, and the
    mountpoint can instead be configured later.

rationale: |-
    Srv deserves files for local network file server such as FTP. Ensuring
    that <tt>/srv</tt> is mounted on its own partition enables the setting of
    more restrictive mount options, and also helps ensure that
    users cannot trivially fill partitions used for log or audit data storage.
