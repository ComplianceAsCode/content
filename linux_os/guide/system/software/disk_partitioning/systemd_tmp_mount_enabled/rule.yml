title: 'Ensure tmp.mount unit is enabled'

description: |-
    The <tt>/tmp</tt> directory is a world-writable directory used
    for temporary file storage. This directory is managed by <tt>systemd-tmpfiles</tt>.
    Ensure that the <tt>tmp.mount</tt> systemd unit is enabled.

rationale: |-
    The <tt>/tmp</tt> directory is used as temporary storage by many programs.
    Placing <tt>/tmp</tt> in a tmpfs filesystem enables the setting of more
    restrictive mount options, which can help protect programs which use it.
    The <tt>tmp.mount</tt> unit configures the tmpfs filesystem and ensures
    the <tt>/tmp</tt> directory is wiped during reboot.
