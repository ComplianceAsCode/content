    {{{ full_name }}} must use a separate file system for /var.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Ensuring that "/var" is mounted on its own partition enables the
    setting of more restrictive mount options. This helps protect
    system services such as daemons or other programs which use it.
    It is not uncommon for the "/var" directory to contain
    world-writable directories installed by other software packages.

    Verify that a separate file system/partition has been created for  /var  with the following command:

     $ mountpoint /var


    If "/var is is not a mountpoint" is returned, then this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Migrate the "/var" path onto a separate file system.
