    {{{ full_name }}} must use a separate file system for /var.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Ensuring that "/var" is mounted on its own partition enables the
    setting of more restrictive mount options. This helps protect
    system services such as daemons or other programs which use it.
    It is not uncommon for the "/var" directory to contain
    world-writable directories installed by other software packages.

    Verify that a separate file system/partition has been created for "/var" with the following command:

    $ mount | grep /var

    UUID=c274f65f-c5b5-4481-b007-bee96feb8b05 /var xfs noatime,nobarrier 1 2

    If a separate entry for "/var" is not in use, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Migrate the "/var" path onto a separate file system.
