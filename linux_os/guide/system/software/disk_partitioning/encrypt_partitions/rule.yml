title: 'Encrypt Partitions'

description: |-
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 natively supports partition encryption through the
    Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to
    encrypt a partition is during installation time.
    <br /><br />
    For manual installations, select the <tt>Encrypt</tt> checkbox during
    partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this
    option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in
    decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually
    every time the system boots.
    <br /><br />
    For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding
    the <tt>--encrypted</tt> and <tt>--passphrase=</tt> options to the definition of each partition to be
    encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition:
    <pre>part / --fstype=ext4 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=<i>PASSPHRASE</i></pre>
    Any <i>PASSPHRASE</i> is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart
    must then be protected accordingly.
    Omitting the <tt>--passphrase=</tt> option from the partition definition will cause the
    installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.
    <br /><br />
    By default, the <tt>Anaconda</tt> installer uses <tt>aes-xts-plain64</tt> cipher
    with a minimum <tt>512</tt> bit key size which should be compatible with FIPS enabled.
    <br /><br />
    Detailed information on encrypting partitions using LUKS or LUKS ciphers can be found on
    the Red Hat Documentation web site:<br />
    {{{ weblink(link="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Security_Guide/sec-Encryption.html") }}}.

rationale: |-
    The risk of a system's physical compromise, particularly mobile systems such as
    laptops, places its data at risk of compromise.  Encrypting this data mitigates
    the risk of its loss if the system is lost.

ocil_clause: 'partitions do not have a type of crypto_LUKS'

ocil: |-
    Check the system partitions to determine if they are encrypted with the following command:
    <pre>blkid</pre>
    <br /><br />
    Output will be similar to:
    <pre>/dev/sda1: UUID=" ab12c3de-4f56-789a-8f33-3850cc8ce3a2
    " TYPE="crypto_LUKS"
    /dev/sda2: UUID=" bc98d7ef-6g54-321h-1d24-9870de2ge1a2
    " TYPE="crypto_LUKS"</pre>
    <br /><br />
    Pseudo-file systems, such as /proc, /sys, and tmpfs, are not required to use disk encryption and are not a finding.
