title: 'Disk Partitioning'

description: |-
    To ensure separation and protection of data, there
    are top-level system directories which should be placed on their
    own physical partition or logical volume. The installer's default
    partitioning scheme creates separate logical volumes for
    <tt>/</tt>, <tt>/boot</tt>, and <tt>swap</tt>.
    <ul>
    <li>If starting with any of the default layouts, check the box to
    \"Review and modify partitioning.\" This allows for the easy creation
    of additional logical volumes inside the volume group already
    created, though it may require making <tt>/</tt>'s logical volume smaller to
    create space. In general, using logical volumes is preferable to
    using partitions because they can be more easily adjusted
    later.</li>
    <li>If creating a custom layout, create the partitions mentioned in
    the previous paragraph (which the installer will require anyway),
    as well as separate ones described in the following sections.</li>
    </ul>
    If a system has already been installed, and the default
    partitioning
    scheme was used, it is possible but nontrivial to
    modify it to create separate logical volumes for the directories
    listed above. The Logical Volume Manager (LVM) makes this possible.

    for more detailed information on LVM.
