title: 'Ensure Home Directories are Located On Separate Partition'

description: |-
    If user home directories will be stored locally, create a separate partition,
    e.g. <tt>/home</tt>, at installation time (or migrate it later using LVM). If
    <tt>/home</tt> will be mounted from another system such as an NFS server, then
    creating a separate partition is not necessary at installation time, and the
    mountpoint can instead be configured later.

rationale: |-
    Ensuring that home directories are mounted on their own partition enables the
    setting of more restrictive mount options, and also helps ensure that
    users cannot trivially fill partitions used for log or audit data storage.

ocil_clause: "no line is returned"

ocil: |
    Assuming that user home directories are under <tt>/home</tt>,
    run the following command to determine if they use their own partition or
    logical volume:
    <pre>$ mount | grep "on /home"</pre>
    If <code>/home</code> has
    its own partition or volume group, a line will be returned.
