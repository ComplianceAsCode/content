srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must use a separate file system for the system audit data path.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Placing "/var/log/audit" in its own partition enables better separation between audit files and other system files, and helps ensure that
    auditing cannot be halted due to the partition running out of space.

checktext: |-
    Verify that a separate file system/partition has been created for the system audit data path with the following command:

    Note: /var/log/audit is used as the example as it is a common location.

    $ mount | grep /var/log/audit

    UUID=2efb2979-45ac-82d7-0ae632d11f51 on /var/log/home type xfs  (rw,realtime,seclabel,attr2,inode64)

    If no line is returned, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Migrate the system audit data path onto a separate file system.
