srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must use a separate file system for the system audit data path.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Placing "/var/log/audit" in its own partition enables better separation between audit files and other system files, and helps ensure that auditing cannot be halted due to the partition running out of space.

checktext: |-
    Verify that a separate file system/partition has been created for the system audit data path with the following command:

    Note: /var/log/audit is used as the example as it is a common location.

    $ mount | grep /var/log/audit

    /dev/mapper/rootvg-varlogaudit on /var/log/audit type xfs (rw,relatime,seclabel,attr2,inode64,logbufs=8,logbsize=32k,noquota)

    Note: Options displayed for mount may differ.

    If no line is returned, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Migrate the system audit data path onto a separate file system.
