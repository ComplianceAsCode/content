title: 'Ensure /tmp Located On Separate Partition'

description: |-
    The <tt>/tmp</tt> directory is a world-writable directory used
    for temporary file storage. Ensure it has its own partition or
    logical volume at installation time, or migrate it using LVM.

rationale: |-
    The <tt>/tmp</tt> partition is used as temporary storage by many programs.
    Placing <tt>/tmp</tt> in its own partition enables the setting of more
    restrictive mount options, which can help protect programs which use it.
