    {{{ full_name }}} must use a separate file system for /tmp.

vuldiscussion: |-
    The "/tmp" partition is used as temporary storage by many programs. Placing "/tmp" in its own partition enables the setting of more restrictive mount options, which can help protect programs that use it.

checktext: |-
    Verify that a separate file system/partition has been created for "/tmp" with the following command:

    $ mount | grep /tmp

    /dev/mapper/rhel-tmp on /tmp type xfs (rw,nodev,nosuid,noexec,seclabel)

    If a separate entry for "/tmp" is not in use, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Migrate the "/tmp" path onto a separate file system.
