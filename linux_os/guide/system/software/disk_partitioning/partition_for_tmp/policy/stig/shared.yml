    {{{ full_name }}} must use a separate file system for /tmp.

vuldiscussion: |-

checktext: |-
    Verify that a separate file system/partition has been created for  /tmp  with the following command:

     $ mountpoint /tmp


    If "/tmp is is not a mountpoint" is returned, then this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Migrate the "/tmp" path onto a separate file system.
