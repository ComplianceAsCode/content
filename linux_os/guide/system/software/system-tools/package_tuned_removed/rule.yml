title: 'Uninstall tuned Package'

description: |-
    {{{ describe_package_remove(package="tuned") }}}

rationale: |-
    <tt>tuned</tt> contains a daemon that tunes the system settings dynamically.
    It does so by monitoring the usage of several system components periodically. Based
    on that information, components will then be put into lower or higher power savings
    modes to adapt to the current usage.
