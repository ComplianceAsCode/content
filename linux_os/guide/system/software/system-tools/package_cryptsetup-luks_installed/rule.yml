title: 'Install cryptsetup-luks Package'

description: |-
    {{{ describe_package_install(package="cryptsetup-luks") }}}

rationale: |-
    LUKS is the upcoming standard for Linux hard disk encryption. By providing a standard
    on-disk format, it does not only facilitate compatibility among distributions, but also
    provide secure management of multiple user passwords. In contrast to existing solution,
    LUKS stores all necessary setup information in the partition header, enabling the user
    to transport or migrate their data seamlessly. LUKS for dm-crypt is implemented in
    <tt>cryptsetup</tt>. <tt>cryptsetup-luks</tt> is intended as a complete replacement for the
    original <tt>cryptsetup</tt>. It provides all the functionality of the original
    version plus all LUKS features, that are accessible by luks* action.
