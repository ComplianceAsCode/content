rationale: |-
    Red Hat Subscription Manager is a local service which tracks installed products
    and subscriptions on a local system to help manage subscription assignments.
    It communicates with the backend subscription service (the Customer Portal
    or an on-premise server such as Subscription Asset Manager) and works with
    content management tools such as yum.
