title: 'Install subscription-manager Package'

description: |-
    {{{ describe_package_install(package="subscription-manager") }}}

rationale: |-
    Red Hat Subscription Manager is a local service which tracks installed products
    and subscriptions on a local system to help manage subscription assignments.
    It communicates with the backend subscription service (the Customer Portal
    or an on-premise server such as Subscription Asset Manager) and works with
    content management tools such as {{{ package_manager }}}.

    {{% if product in ["rhel9"] %}}
    The package provides, among other things, {{{ package_manager }}} plugins
    to interact with repositories and subscriptions
    from the Red Hat entitlement platform - the subscription-manager and
    product-id plugins.
