description: |-
    {{{ describe_package_remove(package="krb5-workstation") }}}

rationale: |-
    Kerberos is a network authentication system. The <tt>krb5-workstation</tt> package contains the basic
    Kerberos programs (<tt>kinit</tt>, <tt>klist</tt>, <tt>kdestroy</tt>, <tt>kpasswd</tt>).

    Currently, Kerberos does not utilize FIPS 140-2 cryptography and is not permitted on Government networks,
    nor is it permitted in many regulatory environments such as HIPAA.
