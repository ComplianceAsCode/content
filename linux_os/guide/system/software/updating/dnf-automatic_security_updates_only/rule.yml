title: Configure dnf-automatic to Install Only Security Updates

description: |-
    To configure <tt>dnf-automatic</tt> to install only security updates
    automatically, set <tt>upgrade_type</tt> to <tt>security</tt> under
    <tt>[commands]</tt> section in <tt>/etc/dnf/automatic.conf</tt>.

rationale: |-
    By default, <tt>dnf-automatic</tt> installs all available updates.
    Reducing the amount of updated packages only to updates that were
    issued as a part of a security advisory increases the system stability.

severity: low

ocil_clause: 'the upgrade_type is not set to security'

ocil: |-
    To verify that only security updates will be automatically installed by dnf-automatic, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep upgrade_type /etc/dnf/automatic.conf</pre>
    The output should return the following:
    <pre>upgrade_type = security</pre>
