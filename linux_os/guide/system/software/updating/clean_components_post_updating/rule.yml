title: 'Ensure YUM Removes Previous Package Versions'

description: |-
    <tt>Yum</tt> should be configured to remove previous software components after
    previous versions have been installed. To configure <tt>yum</tt> to remove the
    previous software components after updating, set the <tt>clean_requirements_on_remove</tt>
    to <tt>1</tt> in <tt>/etc/yum.conf</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Previous versions of software components that are not removed from the information
    system after updates have been installed may be exploited by some adversaries.
