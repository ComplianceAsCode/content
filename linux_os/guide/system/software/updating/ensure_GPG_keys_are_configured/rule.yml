title: 'Ensure GPG keys are configured'

description: |-
    The operation system or installed application can be successfully bootstrapped 
    without the GPG key being trusted. However, you cannot install new packages or 
    update them until the keys are trusted.
    <br /><br /> 
    Most packages managers implement GPG key signing to verify package integrity 
    during installation.
    <br /><br />
    To verify GPG keys are configured correctly for your package manager, 
    one of the following command groups may provide the needed information
    depending on the package manager in use. 
    <br /><br />
    In SUSE Linux distributions, the administrators have to follow the next steps: <br />
    1. Log on to the system as a user with administrator rights.<br />
    2. Locate and download package, for example zoom_x86_64.rpm<br />
    3. Locate and download the public key (GPG) from the software download site, for 
    example the key for zoom package is package-signing-key-5-12-6.pub<br />
    4. Import the key public key:<br />
    <tt>$ sudo rpm --import package-signing-key-5-12-6.pub</tt><br />
    5. List the keys, for example the command:<br /> 
    <tt>$ sudo rpm -qa gpg-pubkey*</tt><br />
    will provide:<br />
    <tt>gpg-pubkey-dd79b481-62fe7502</tt><br />
    6. Get more details about the key, via the command:<br />
    <tt>$ sudo rpm -qa gpg-pubkey-dd79b481-62fe7502</tt><br />
    7. Check the GPG key, for example the command:<br /> 
    <tt>$ sudo rpm -q gpg-pubkey --qf '%{name}-%{version}-%{release} --&gt; %{summary}\n'</tt><br />
    will provide:<br />
    <tt>gpg-pubkey-dd79b481-62fe7502 --&gt; gpg(Zoom Video Communications, Inc. &lt;CryptoOpsCodeSignProd@zoom.us&gt;)</tt><br />
    <br /><br />
    
rationale: |-
    It is important to ensure that updates are obtained from a valid source to protect 
    against spoofing that could lead to the inadvertent installation of malware on the 
    system.
