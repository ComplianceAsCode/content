description: |-
{{% if product in ["rhel7", "rhel8"] %}}
    If the system is joined to the Red Hat Network, a Red Hat Satellite Server,
    or a yum server, run the following command to install updates:
    <pre>$ sudo yum update</pre>
    If the system is not configured to use one of these sources, updates (in the form of RPM packages)
    can be manually downloaded from the Red Hat Network and installed using <tt>rpm</tt>.
{{% elif product in ["ol7", "ol8", "ol9"] %}}
    If the system is joined to the ULN
    or a yum server, run the following command to install updates:
    <pre>$ sudo yum update</pre>
    If the system is not configured to use one of these sources, updates (in the form of RPM packages)
    can be manually downloaded from the ULN and installed using <tt>rpm</tt>.
{{% elif product in ["sle12", "sle15"] %}}
    If the system is configured for online updates, invoking the following command will list available
    security updates:
    <pre>$ sudo zypper refresh &amp;&amp; sudo zypper list-patches -g security</pre>
{{% elif 'ubuntu' in product %}}
    If the system has an apt repository available, run the following command to install updates:
    <pre>$ apt update &#38;&#38; apt full-upgrade</pre>
{{% endif %}}
    <br /><br />
    NOTE: U.S. Defense systems are required to be patched within 30 days or sooner as local policy
    dictates.

rationale: |-
    Installing software updates is a fundamental mitigation against
    the exploitation of publicly-known vulnerabilities. If the most
    recent security patches and updates are not installed, unauthorized
    users may take advantage of weaknesses in the unpatched software. The
    lack of prompt attention to patching could result in a system compromise.

    Obtain the list of available package security updates from Red Hat. The URL for updates is https://access.redhat.com/errata-search/.
    It is important to note that updates provided by Red Hat may not be present on the system if the underlying packages are not installed.


    Check that the available package security updates have been installed on the system with the following command:

    $ sudo yum history list | more

    Loaded plugins: langpacks, product-id, subscription-manager
    ID | Command line | Date and time | Action(s) | Altered
