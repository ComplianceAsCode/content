    If the system is joined to the Red Hat Network, a Red Hat Satellite Server,
    or a yum server, run the following command to install updates:
    <pre>$ sudo yum update</pre>
    If the system is not configured to use one of these sources, updates (in the form of RPM packages)
    can be manually downloaded from the Red Hat Network and installed using <tt>rpm</tt>.
{{% elif product == "ol7" %}}
    If the system is joined to the ULN
    or a yum server, run the following command to install updates:
    <pre>$ sudo yum update</pre>
    If the system is not configured to use one of these sources, updates (in the form of RPM packages)
    can be manually downloaded from the ULN and installed using <tt>rpm</tt>.

    NOTE: U.S. Defense systems are required to be patched within 30 days or sooner as local policy
    dictates.

rationale: |-
    Installing software updates is a fundamental mitigation against
    the exploitation of publicly-known vulnerabilities. If the most
    recent security patches and updates are not installed, unauthorized
    users may take advantage of weaknesses in the unpatched software. The
    lack of prompt attention to patching could result in a system compromise.
