title: 'Ensure updates, patches, and additional security software are installed'

description: |-
    Periodically patches are released for included software either due to security flaws or to
    include additional functionality.
    <tt>Note:Site policy may mandate a testing period before install onto production systems for
    available updates.</tt>

rationale: |-
    Newer patches may contain security enhancements that would not be available through the
    latest full update. As a result, it is recommended that the latest software patches be used to
    take advantage of the latest functionality. As with any software installation, organizations
    need to determine if a given update meets their requirements and verify the compatibility
    and supportability of any additional software against the update revision that is selected.
