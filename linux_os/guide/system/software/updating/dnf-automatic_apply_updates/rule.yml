title: Configure dnf-automatic to Install Available Updates Automatically

description: |-
    To ensure that the packages comprising the available updates will be automatically installed by <tt>dnf-automatic</tt>, set <tt>apply_updates</tt> to <tt>yes</tt> under <tt>[commands]</tt> section in <tt>/etc/dnf/automatic.conf</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Installing software updates is a fundamental mitigation against
    the exploitation of publicly-known vulnerabilities. If the most
    recent security patches and updates are not installed, unauthorized
    users may take advantage of weaknesses in the unpatched software. The
    lack of prompt attention to patching could result in a system compromise.
    The automated installation of updates ensures that recent security patches
    are applied in a timely manner.
