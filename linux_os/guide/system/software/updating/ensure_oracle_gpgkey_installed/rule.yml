title: 'Ensure Oracle Linux GPG Key Installed'

description: |-
    To ensure the system can cryptographically verify base software
    packages come from Oracle (and to connect to the Unbreakable Linux Network to
    receive them), the Oracle GPG key must properly be installed.
    To install the Oracle GPG key, run:
    <pre>$ sudo uln_register</pre>
    If the system is not connected to the Internet,
    then install the Oracle GPG key from trusted media such as
    the Oracle installation CD-ROM or DVD. Assuming the disc is mounted
    in <tt>/media/cdrom</tt>, use the following command as the root user to import
    it into the keyring:
    <pre>$ sudo rpm --import /media/cdrom/RPM-GPG-KEY</pre>

rationale: |-
    Changes to software components can have significant effects on the
    overall security of the operating system. This requirement ensures
    the software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided
    by a trusted vendor. The Oracle GPG key is necessary to
    cryptographically verify packages are from Oracle.
