title: 'Ensure EPEL Repository is Disabled'

description: |-
    The system must not have the EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) repository enabled.
    EPEL provides additional packages that are not part of the official RHEL distribution and
    may not meet enterprise security requirements.

    Check if any repository files in <tt>/etc/yum.repos.d/</tt> contain enabled EPEL repositories
    by running:
    <pre>$ grep -r "^\[.*epel.*\]" /etc/yum.repos.d/</pre>

    If EPEL repositories are found, ensure they are disabled by setting <tt>enabled=0</tt> in
    the repository configuration file.

rationale: |-
    The EPEL repository is not officially supported by Red Hat and may contain packages that have
    not been vetted for security in an enterprise environment. Using unsupported repositories can
    introduce vulnerabilities, compatibility issues, or packages that do not meet DoD security
    requirements. Only packages from authorized repositories should be installed to maintain
    system integrity and security.

ocil: |-
    To verify that EPEL repository is not enabled, run the following commands:
    <pre>$ grep -r "^\[.*epel.*\]" /etc/yum.repos.d/</pre>
    For each EPEL repository found, check if it is enabled:
    <pre>$ grep -A 5 "^\[.*epel.*\]" /etc/yum.repos.d/*.repo | grep "enabled"</pre>
    The output should show <tt>enabled=0</tt> for all EPEL repositories, or no EPEL repositories
    should be present.
