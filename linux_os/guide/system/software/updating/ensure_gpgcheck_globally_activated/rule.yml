title: 'Ensure gpgcheck Enabled In Main {{{ pkg_manager }}} Configuration'

description: |-
    The <tt>gpgcheck</tt> option controls whether
    RPM packages' signatures are always checked prior to installation.
    To configure {{{ pkg_manager }}} to check package signatures before installing
    them, ensure the following line appears in <tt>{{{ pkg_manager_config_file }}}</tt> in
    the <tt>[main]</tt> section:
    <pre>gpgcheck=1</pre>

rationale: |-
    Changes to any software components can have significant effects on the
    overall security of the operating system. This requirement ensures the
    software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a
    trusted vendor.
    <br />
    Accordingly, patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system
    components must be signed with a certificate recognized and approved by the
    organization.
    <br />Verifying the authenticity of the software prior to installation
    validates the integrity of the patch or upgrade received from a vendor.
    This ensures the software has not been tampered with and that it has been
    provided by a trusted vendor. Self-signed certificates are disallowed by
    this requirement. Certificates used to verify the software must be from an
    approved Certificate Authority (CA).

    Verify that {{{ pkg_manager }}} verifies the signature of packages from a repository prior to install with the following command:

    <pre>$ grep gpgcheck {{{ pkg_manager_config_file }}}</pre>

    <pre>gpgcheck=1</pre>

    If "gpgcheck" is not set to "1", or if the option is missing or commented out, ask the System Administrator how the certificates for patches and other operating system components are verified.
