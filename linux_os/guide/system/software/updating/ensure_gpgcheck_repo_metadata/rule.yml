title: 'Ensure gpgcheck Enabled for Repository Metadata'

description: |-
    Verify the operating system prevents the installation of patches,
    service packs, device drivers, or operating system components of
    local packages without verification of the repository metadata.
    Check that <tt>{{{ pkg_manager }}}</tt> verifies the repository
    metadata prior to install with the following command.
    This should be configured by setting <tt>repo_gpgcheck</tt> to <tt>1</tt>
    in <tt>{{{ pkg_manager_config_file }}}</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Changes to any software components can have significant effects to the
    overall security of the operating system. This requirement ensures the
    software has not been tampered and has been provided by a trusted vendor.
    Accordingly, patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system
    components must be signed with a certificate recognized and approved by
    the organization. Verifying the authenticity of the software prior to
    installation validates the integrity of the patch or upgrade received from
    a vendor. This ensures the software has not been tampered with and that it
    has been provided by a trusted vendor. Self-signed certificates are
    disallowed by this requirement. The operating system should not have
    to verify the software again. NOTE: For U.S. Military systems, this
    requirement does not mandate DoD certificates for this purpose; however,
    the certificate used to verify the software must be from an approved
    Certificate Authority.

ocil: |-
    To verify that <tt>repo_gpgcheck</tt> is configured properly, run the following
    command:
    <pre>$ grep repo_gpgcheck {{{ pkg_manager_config_file }}}</pre>
    The output should return something similar to:
