title: Ensure gpgcheck Is Enabled for All Package Repositories

description: |-
    To ensure signature checking is enabled for all package repositories, the
    <tt>gpgcheck</tt> option must be enabled for all repos.
    Configure the operating system to verify the signature of packages from
    a repository prior to install by setting the following option in
    the <tt>"/etc/yum.repos.d/[your_repo_name].repo"</tt> file:
    <pre>gpgcheck=1</pre>

rationale: |-
    Changes to any software components can have significant effects on the
    overall security of the operating system. This requirement ensures the
    software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by
    a trusted vendor.

ocil: |-
    To determine whether <tt>{{{ pkg_manager }}}</tt> has been configured to disable
    <tt>gpgcheck</tt> for any repos, inspect all files in
    <tt>{{{ pkg_manager_repos }}}</tt> and ensure the following does not appear in any
    sections:
    <pre>gpgcheck=0</pre>
    A value of <tt>0</tt> indicates that <tt>gpgcheck</tt> has been disabled for that repo.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to verify the signature of packages from a repository prior to install by setting the following option in the "/etc/yum.repos.d/[your_repo_name].repo" file:

    gpgcheck=1

checktext: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} prevents the installation of patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system components from a repository without verification that they have been digitally signed using a certificate that is recognized and approved by the organization.

    Check that {{{ pkg_manager }}} verifies the signature of packages from a repository prior to install with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -E '^\[.*\]|gpgcheck' /etc/yum.repos.d/*.repo

    /etc/yum.repos.d/appstream.repo:[appstream]
    /etc/yum.repos.d/appstream.repo:gpgcheck=1
    /etc/yum.repos.d/baseos.repo:[baseos]
    /etc/yum.repos.d/baseos.repo:gpgcheck=1

    If "gpgcheck" is not set to "1", or if options are missing or commented out, ask the System Administrator how the certificates for patches and other operating system components are verified.

    If there is no process to validate certificates that is approved by the organization, this is a finding.
