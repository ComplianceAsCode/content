srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must ensure cryptographic verification of vendor software packages.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Changes to any software components can have significant effects on the overall security of the operating system. This requirement ensures the software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a trusted vendor.

    Accordingly, patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system components must be signed with a certificate recognized and approved by the organization.

    Verifying the authenticity of the software prior to installation validates the integrity of the patch or upgrade received from a vendor. This verifies the software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a trusted vendor. Self-signed certificates are disallowed by this requirement. The operating system should not have to verify the software again. This requirement does not mandate DoD certificates for this purpose; however, the certificate used to verify the software must be from Red Hat.

checktext: |-
    Confirm Red Hat package-signing keys are installed on the system and verify their fingerprints match vendor values.

    Note: For {{{ full_name }}} software packages, Red Hat uses GPG keys labeled "release key 2" and "auxiliary key 3". The keys are defined in key file "/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release" by default.

    List Red Hat GPG keys installed on the system:

    $ sudo rpm -q --queryformat "%{SUMMARY}\n" gpg-pubkey | grep -i "red hat"

    Red Hat, Inc. (release key 2) &ltsecurity@redhat.com&gt public key
    Red Hat, Inc. (auxiliary key 3) &ltsecurity@redhat.com&gt public key

    If Red Hat GPG keys "release key 2" and "auxiliary key 3" are not installed, this is a finding.

    List key fingerprints of installed Red Hat GPG keys:

    $ sudo gpg -q --keyid-format short --with-fingerprint /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release

    If key file "/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release" is missing, this is a finding.

    Example output:

    pub   rsa4096/FD431D51 2009-10-22 [SC]
          Key fingerprint = 567E 347A D004 4ADE 55BA  8A5F 199E 2F91 FD43 1D51
    uid                   Red Hat, Inc. (release key 2) &ltsecurity@redhat.com&gt
    pub   rsa4096/5A6340B3 2022-03-09 [SC]
          Key fingerprint = 7E46 2425 8C40 6535 D56D  6F13 5054 E4A4 5A63 40B3
    uid                   Red Hat, Inc. (auxiliary key 3) &ltsecurity@redhat.com&gt

    Compare key fingerprints of installed Red Hat GPG keys with fingerprints listed for {{{ full_name }}} on Red Hat "Product Signing Keys" webpage at https://access.redhat.com/security/team/key.

    If key fingerprints do not match, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Install Red Hat package-signing keys on the system and verify their fingerprints match vendor values.

    Insert {{{ full_name }}} installation disc or attach {{{ full_name }}} installation image to the system. Mount the disc or image to make the contents accessible inside the system.

    Assuming the mounted location is "/media/cdrom", use the following command to copy Red Hat GPG key file onto the system:

    $ sudo cp /media/cdrom/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/

    Import Red Hat GPG keys from key file into system keyring:

    $ sudo rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release

    Using the steps listed in the Check Text, confirm the newly imported keys show as installed on the system and verify their fingerprints match vendor values.

vuln_discussion: |-
    Cryptographic verification of vendor software packages ensures that all software packages are obtained from a valid source and protects against spoofing that could lead to installation of malware on the system. Red Hat cryptographically signs all software packages, which includes updates, with a GPG key to verify that they are valid.
