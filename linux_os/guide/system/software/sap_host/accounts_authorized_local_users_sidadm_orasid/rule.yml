title: 'Only sidadm and orasid/oracle User Accounts Exist on Operating System'

description: |-
    SAP tends to use the server or virtual machine exclusively. There should be only
    SAP system users <tt>sidadm</tt> and <tt>orasid</tt> that exist on the operating
    system (or virtual machine). If SAP Host Agent is installed, the user <tt>sapadm</tt>
    must exist too. With Oracle Database using <tt>oracle</tt> user, the user <tt>oracle</tt>
    should exist as well. While <tt>SID</tt> is the SAP System ID, which is always
    three alphanumeric characters in upper case, beginning with an alphabetic character,
    the user names <tt>sidadm</tt> and <tt>orasid</tt> are in lower case.
    <br /> <br />
    Besides the above SAP users that are automatically detected, other operating system
    users can be customized in the refine value variable
    <tt>var_accounts_authorized_local_users_regex</tt>.
    OVAL regular expression is used for the user list.
    <br /> <br />
    Test result of both <tt>fail</tt> or <tt>error</tt> means mismatch of user names and
    SAP system. The bash remediation commands can be used to delete unexpected users on
    the operating system.

rationale: |-
    Accounts providing no operational purpose provide additional opportunities for
    system compromise. Unnecessary accounts include user accounts for individuals not
    requiring access to the system and application accounts for applications not installed
    on the system.

ocil_clause: 'there are unauthorized local user accounts on the system'

ocil: |-
    To verify that there are no unauthorized local user accounts, run the following command:
    <pre>$ less /etc/passwd </pre>
    Inspect the results, and if unauthorized local user accounts exist, remove them by
    running the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo userdel <i>unauthorized_user</i></pre>

warnings:
    - general: |-
        Currently this rule only works with following limitations:
        <br />
        1. <tt>SAP system mount directory</tt> is <tt>/sapmnt</tt> (mounted or local file system
        or a symbolic link to the target directory);
        <br />
        2. there is maximum one SAP System on each operating system or virtual machine (maximum
        one SID in /sapmnt and /usr/sap).
        <br />
        With the above limitations, the SAP system users <tt>sidadm</tt>, <tt>orasid</tt>, <tt>sapadm</tt>
        and <tt>oracle</tt> can be automatically detected.
        <br /> <br />
        For other cases, please use the general purpose rule <tt>accounts_authorized_local_users</tt>
        and customize the refine value variable <tt>var_accounts_authorized_local_users_regex</tt>
        by adding all the authorized user names to the list.
        <br /> <br />
        The bash remediation is not limited by the above two conditions, it works in all the cases
        regardless there is zero, one or multiple SAP systems on the OS/VM.
