title: 'Accounts Authorized Local Users on the Operating System'


description: |-
    List the user accounts that are authorized locally on the operating system. This list
    includes both users requried by the operating system and by the installed applications.
    Depending on the Operating System distribution, version, software groups and applications,
    the user list is different and can be customized with scap-workbench.
    OVAL regular expression is used for the user list.
    The list starts with '^' and ends with '$' so that it matches exactly the
    username, not any string that includes the username. Users are separated with '|'.
    For example, three users: bin, oracle and sapadm are allowd, then the list is
    <tt>^(bin|oracle|sapadm)$</tt>. The user <tt>root</tt> is the only user that is hard coded
    in OVAL that is always allowed on the operating system.
