title: 'Only Authorized Local User Accounts Exist on Operating System'

description: |-
    Enterprise Application tends to use the server or virtual machine exclusively.
    Besides the default operating system user, there should be only authorized local
    users required by the installed softoware groups and applications that exist on
    the operating system. The authorized user list can be customized in the refine
    value variable <tt>var_accounts_authorized_local_users_regex</tt>.
    OVAL regular expression is used for the user list.
    Configure the system so all accounts on the system are assigned to an active system,
    application, or user account. Remove accounts that do not support approved system
    activities or that allow for a normal user to perform administrative-level actions.
    To remove unauthorized system accounts, use the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo userdel <i>unauthorized_user</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    Accounts providing no operational purpose provide additional opportunities for
    system compromise. Unnecessary accounts include user accounts for individuals not
    requiring access to the system and application accounts for applications not installed
    on the system.
