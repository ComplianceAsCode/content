title: 'Package glibc Installed'

description: |-
    The package <tt>glibc</tt> is installed on Linux by default, but the
    <tt>glibc</tt> version might not be sufficient for SAP. Please refer to
    SAP note of your Linux version for the minimum requirement on <tt>glibc</tt>.
    {{{ describe_package_install(package="glibc") }}}

rationale: |-
    The <tt>glibc</tt> package contains standard C and math libraries used by
    multiple programs on Linux. The <tt>glibc</tt> shipped with first release
    of each major Linux version is often not sufficient for SAP.
    An update is required after the first OS installation.
