title: 'Package uuidd Installed'

description: |-
    The package <tt>uuidd</tt> is not installed on normal Linux distribution
    by default. Applications require this package to avoid database
    inconsistences caused by duplicated UUIDs. Especially in banking services
    with SAP where massive UUIDs are created in a short time period, it is
    important to install the package <tt>uuidd</tt>. More information can be
    found in SAP note 1391070.
    {{{ describe_package_install(package="uuidd") }}}

rationale: |-
    The <tt>uuidd</tt> package contains a userspace daemon (uuidd) which is
    used to generate unique identifiers even at very high rates on
    SMP systems.
