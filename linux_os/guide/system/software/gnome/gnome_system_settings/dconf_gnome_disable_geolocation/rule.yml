title: 'Disable Geolocation in GNOME3'

description: |-
    <tt>GNOME</tt> allows the clock and applications to track and access
    location information. This setting should be disabled as applications
    should not track system location. To configure the system to disable
    location tracking, add or set <tt>enabled</tt> to <tt>false</tt> in
    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:
    <pre>[org/gnome/system/location]
    enabled=false</pre>
    To configure the clock to disable location tracking, add or set
    <tt>geolocation</tt> to <tt>false</tt> in
    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:
    <pre>[org/gnome/clocks]
    geolocation=false</pre>
    Once the settings have been added, add a lock to
    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent
    user modification. For example:
    <pre>/org/gnome/system/location/enabled
    /org/gnome/clocks/geolocation</pre>
    After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Power settings should not be enabled on systems that are not mobile devices.
    Enabling power settings on non-mobile devices could have unintended processing
    consequences on standard systems.

    To ensure that system location tracking is not active, run the following command:
    <pre>$ gsettings get org.gnome.system.location enabled
    $ gsettings get org.gnome.clocks geolocation</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should be <tt>false</tt>.
    To ensure that users cannot enable system location tracking, run the following:
    <pre>$ grep location /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/*</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should be
    <tt>/org/gnome/system/location/enabled</tt> and <tt>/org/gnome/clocks/geolocation</tt>.
