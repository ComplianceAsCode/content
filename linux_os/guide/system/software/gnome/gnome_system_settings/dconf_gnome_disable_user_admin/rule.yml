title: 'Disable User Administration in GNOME3'

description: |-
    By default, <tt>GNOME</tt> will allow all users to have some administratrion
    capability. This should be disabled so that non-administrative users are not making
    configuration changes. To configure the system to disable user administration
    capability in the Graphical User Interface (GUI), add or set
    <tt>user-administration-disabled</tt> to <tt>true</tt> in
    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:
    <pre>[org/gnome/desktop/lockdown]
    user-administration-disabled=true
    </pre>
    Once the settings have been added, add a lock to
    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent user modification.
    For example:
    <pre>/org/gnome/desktop/lockdown/user-administration-disabled</pre>
    After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Allowing all users to have some administratrive capabilities to the system through
    the Graphical User Interface (GUI) when they would not have them otherwise could allow
    unintended configuration changes as well as a nefarious user the capability to make system
    changes such as adding new accounts, etc.

ocil: |-
    To ensure the GUI does not allow user administratrion capabilities to all users,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.lockdown user-administration-disabled</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should be <tt>true</tt>.
    To ensure that users cannot enable user administration, run the following:
    <pre>$ grep user-administration /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/*</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should be
    <tt>/org/gnome/desktop/lockdown/user-administration-disabled</tt>
