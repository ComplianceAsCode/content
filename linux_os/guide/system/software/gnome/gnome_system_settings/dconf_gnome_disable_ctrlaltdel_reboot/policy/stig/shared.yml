srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must prevent a user from overriding the Ctrl-Alt-Del sequence settings for the graphical user interface.

vuldiscussion: |-
    A locally logged-in user who presses Ctrl-Alt-Del, when at the console,
    can reboot the system. If accidentally pressed, as could happen in
    the case of mixed OS environment, this can create the risk of short-term
    loss of availability of systems due to unintentional reboot.

checktext: |-
    Verify that users cannot enable the Ctrl-Alt-Del sequence in the Gnome GUI with the following command:

    Note: This requirement assumes the use of the {{{ full_name }}} default graphical user interface, Gnome Shell. If the system does not have any graphical user interface installed, this requirement is Not Applicable.

     $ grep logout /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/*

    /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/logout

    If the output is not "/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/logout", the line is commented out, or the line is missing, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to disallow the user changing the Ctrl-Alt-Del sequence in the GNOME GUI, if it is installed and the system is used to host services whos availability could be impacted.

    Create a database to container system-wide graphical user logon settings (if it does not already exist) with the following command:

    $ sudo touch /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/session

    Add the following line to the session locks file to prevent unprivileged users from modifying the Ctrl-Alt-Del setting:

    /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/logout

    Run the following command to update the database:

    $ sudo dconf update
