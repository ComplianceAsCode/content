srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must disable the ability of a user to accidentally press Ctrl-Alt-Del and cause a system to shut down or reboot.

vuldiscussion: |-
    A locally logged-in user who presses Ctrl-Alt-Del, when at the console,
    can reboot the system. If accidentally pressed, as could happen in
    the case of mixed OS environment, this can create the risk of short-term
    loss of availability of systems due to unintentional reboot.

checktext: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} is configured to ignore the Ctrl-Alt-Del sequence in the Gnome GUI with the following command:

    Note: This requirement assumes the use of the {{{ full_name }}} default graphical user interface, Gnome Shell. If the system does not have any graphical user interface installed, this requirement is Not Applicable.

    $ gsettings get org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys logout

    "['']"

    If Gnome is configured to shut down when Ctrl-Alt-Del is pressed, this is a finding.
