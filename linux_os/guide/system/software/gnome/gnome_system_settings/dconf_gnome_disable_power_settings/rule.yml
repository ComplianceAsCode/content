title: 'Disable Power Settings in GNOME3'

description: |-
    By default, <tt>GNOME</tt> enables a power profile designed for mobile devices
    with battery usage. While useful for mobile devices, this setting should be disabled
    for all other systems. To configure the system to disable the power setting, add or set
    <tt>active</tt> to <tt>false</tt> in
    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:
    <pre>[org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/power]
    active=false
    </pre>
    Once the settings have been added, add a lock to
    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent user modification.
    For example:
    <pre>/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/power</pre>
    After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Power settings should not be enabled on systems that are not mobile devices.
    Enabling power settings on non-mobile devices could have unintended processing
    consequences on standard systems.

    To ensure that the GUI power settings are not active, run the following command:
    <pre>$ gsettings get org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power active</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should be <tt>false</tt>.
    To ensure that users cannot enable the power settings, run the following:
    <pre>$ grep power /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/*</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should be
    <tt>/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/power/active</tt>
