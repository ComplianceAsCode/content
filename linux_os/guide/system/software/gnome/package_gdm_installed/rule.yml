title: Install gdm Package

description: |-
    {{{ describe_package_install(package="gdm") }}}

rationale: |-
    GDM, the GNOME Display Manager, handles authentication-related backend
    functionality for logging in a user and unlocking the user's session after
    it's been locked. GDM also provides functionality for initiating user-switching,
    so more than one user can be logged in at the same time. It handles
    graphical session registration with the system for both local and remote
    sessions (in the latter case, via the XDMCP protocol).  In cases where the
    session doesn't provide it's own display server, GDM can start the display
    server on behalf of the session.
