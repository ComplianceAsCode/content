title: 'Force dconf to use the textfiles instead of a binary DB'

description: |-
    By default, DConf uses a binary database as a data backend.
    The database is compiled from config files by the <pre>dconf update</pre> command.

    dconf can be configured to look into those text files directly by inserting the
    <pre>service-db:keyfile/user</pre>
    directive at the beginning of the <pre>/etc/dconf/profile/user</pre> file.

rationale: |-
    Unlike text config files, the binary database is impossible to check by OVAL.
    Therefore, in order to evaluate dconf configuration, both have to be true at the same time -
    configuration files have to be compliant, and dconf has to be forced to use them
    as the primary settings storage.

    at the top of the
