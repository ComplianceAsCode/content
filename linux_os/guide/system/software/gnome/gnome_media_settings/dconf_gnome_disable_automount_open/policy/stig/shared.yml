    {{{ full_name }}} must prevent a user from overriding the disabling of the graphical user interface automount function.

vuldiscussion: |-
    A nonprivileged account is any operating system account with authorizations of a nonprivileged user.

checktext: |-
    Note: This requirement assumes the use of the {{{ full_name }}} default graphical user interface, the GNOME desktop environment. If the system does not have any graphical user interface installed, this requirement is Not Applicable.

    Verify {{{ full_name }}} disables the ability of the user to override the graphical user interface automount setting.

    Determine which profile the system database is using with the following command:

    $ sudo grep system-db /etc/dconf/profile/user

    system-db:local

    Check that the automount setting is locked from nonprivileged user modification with the following command:

    Note: The example below is using the database "local" for the system, so the path is "/etc/dconf/db/local.d". This path must be modified if a database other than "local" is being used.

    $ grep 'automount-open' /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/*

    /org/gnome/desktop/media-handling/automount-open

    If the command does not return at least the example result, this is a finding.

    Configure the GNOME desktop to not allow a user to change the setting that disables automated mounting of removable media.

    Add the following line to "/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock" to prevent user modification:

    /org/gnome/desktop/media-handling/automount-open

    Then update the dconf system databases:

    $ sudo dconf update
