title: 'Configure GNOME3 DConf User Profile'

description: |-
    By default, DConf provides a standard user profile. This profile contains a list
    of DConf configuration databases. The user profile and database always take the
    highest priority. As such the DConf User profile should always exist and be
    configured correctly.
    <br /><br />
    {{% if product in ["sle12", "sle15"] %}}
    To make sure that the user profile is configured correctly, the <tt>/etc/dconf/profile/gdm</tt>
    should be set as follows:
    <pre>user-db:user
    system-db:gdm
    </pre>
    {{% else %}}
    To make sure that the user profile is configured correctly, the <tt>/etc/dconf/profile/user</tt>
    should be set as follows:
    <pre>user-db:user
    system-db:local
    system-db:site
    system-db:distro
    </pre>
    {{% endif %}}

rationale: |-
    Failure to have a functional DConf profile prevents GNOME3 configuration settings
    from being enforced for all users and allows various security risks.
