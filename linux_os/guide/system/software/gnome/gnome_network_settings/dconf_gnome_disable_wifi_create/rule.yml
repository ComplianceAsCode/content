title: 'Disable WIFI Network Connection Creation in GNOME3'

description: |-
    <tt>GNOME</tt> allows users to create ad-hoc wireless connections through the
    <tt>NetworkManager</tt> applet. Wireless connections should be disabled by
    adding or setting <tt>disable-wifi-create</tt> to <tt>true</tt> in
    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:
    <pre>[org/gnome/nm-applet]
    disable-wifi-create=true
    </pre>
    Once the settings have been added, add a lock to
    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent user modification.
    For example:
    <pre>/org/gnome/nm-applet/disable-wifi-create</pre>
    After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Wireless network connections should not be allowed to be configured by general
    users on a given system as it could open the system to backdoor attacks.
