title: 'Disable WIFI Network Disconnect Notification in GNOME'

description: |-
    By default, <tt>GNOME</tt> disables WIFI notification when disconnecting from a
    wireless network. This should be permanently set so that users do not connect to
    a wireless network when the system finds one. While useful for mobile devices,
    this setting should be disabled for all other systems. To configure the system
    to disable the WIFI notication, run the following:
    <pre>$ sudo gconftool-2 --direct \
      --config-source xml:readwrite:/etc/gconf/gconf.xml.mandatory \
      --type bool \
      --set /apps/nm-applet/disable-disconnected-notifications true</pre>

rationale: |-
    Wireless network connections should not be allowed to be configured by general
    users on a given system as it could open the system to backdoor attacks.
