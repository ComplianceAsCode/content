title: 'Disable WIFI Network Notification in GNOME3'

description: |-
    By default, <tt>GNOME</tt> disables WIFI notification. This should be permanently set
    so that users do not connect to a wireless network when the system finds one.
    While useful for mobile devices, this setting should be disabled for all other systems.
    To configure the system to disable the WIFI notication, add or set
    <tt>suppress-wireless-networks-available</tt> to <tt>true</tt> in
    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:
    <pre>[org/gnome/nm-applet]
    suppress-wireless-networks-available=true
    </pre>
    Once the settings have been added, add a lock to
    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent user modification.
    For example:
    <pre>/org/gnome/nm-applet/suppress-wireless-networks-available</pre>
    After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Wireless network connections should not be allowed to be configured by general
    users on a given system as it could open the system to backdoor attacks.

    To ensure that wireless network notification is disabled, run the following command:
    <pre>$ gsettings get org.gnome.nm-applet suppress-wireless-networks-available</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should be <tt>true</tt>.
    To ensure that users cannot enable wireless notification, run the following:
    <pre>$ grep wireless-networks-available /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/*</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should be
    <tt>/org/gnome/nm-applet/suppress-wireless-networks-available</tt>
