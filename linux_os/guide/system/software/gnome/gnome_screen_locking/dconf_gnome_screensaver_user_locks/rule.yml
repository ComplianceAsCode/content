title: 'Ensure Users Cannot Change GNOME3 Screensaver Settings'

description: |-
    If not already configured, ensure that users cannot change GNOME3 screensaver lock settings
    by adding <tt>/org/gnome/desktop/screensaver/lock-delay</tt>
    to <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent user modification.
    For example:
    <pre>/org/gnome/desktop/screensaver/lock-delay</pre>
    After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.

rationale: |-
    A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate
    physical vicinity of the information system but does not logout because of the temporary nature of the absence.
    Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their operating system session prior to vacating the vicinity,
    GNOME desktops can be configured to identify when a user's session has idled and take action to initiate the
    session lock. As such, users should not be allowed to change session settings.

ocil: |-
    To ensure that users cannot change session idle and lock settings, run the following:
    <pre>$ grep 'lock-delay' /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/*</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should return:
    <tt>/org/gnome/desktop/screensaver/lock-delay</tt>
