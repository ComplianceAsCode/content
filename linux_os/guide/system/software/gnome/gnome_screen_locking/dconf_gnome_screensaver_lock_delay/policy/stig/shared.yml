    {{{ full_name }}} must initiate a session lock for graphical user interfaces when the screensaver is activated.

    A session lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity
    of the information system but does not want to logout because of the temporary nature of the absense.

    Verify {{{ full_name }}} initiates a session lock a for graphical user interfaces when the screensaver is activated with the following command:

    Note: This requirement assumes the use of the {{{ full_name }}} default graphical user interface, Gnome Shell. If the system does not have any graphical user interface installed, this requirement is Not Applicable.

    $ gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.screensaver lock-delay

    uint32 5

    If the "uint32" setting is not set to "5" or less, or is missing, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to initiate a session lock for graphical user interfaces when a screensaver is activated.

    Create a database to contain the system-wide screensaver settings (if it does not already exist) with the following command:

    Note: The example below is using the database "local" for the system, so if the system is using another database in "/etc/dconf/profile/user", the file should be created under the appropriate subdirectory.

    $ sudo touch /etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-screensaver

    [org/gnome/desktop/screensaver]
    lock-delay=uint32 5

    The "uint32" must be included along with the integer key values as shown.

    Update the system databases:

    $ sudo dconf update
