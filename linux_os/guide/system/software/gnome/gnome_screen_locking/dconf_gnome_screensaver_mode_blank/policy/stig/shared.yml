    The dconf settings can be edited in the /etc/dconf/db/* location.

    First, add or update the [org/gnome/desktop/screensaver] section of the "/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings" database file and add or update the following lines:

    [org/gnome/desktop/screensaver]
    picture-uri=''

    Then, add the following line to "/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock" to prevent user modification:

    /org/gnome/desktop/screensaver/picture-uri

    Finally, update the dconf system databases:

    $ sudo dconf update

    To ensure the screensaver is configured to be blank, run the following command:

    Note: This requirement assumes the use of the {{{ full_name }}} default graphical user interface, the GNOME desktop environment. If the system does not have any graphical user interface installed, this requirement is Not Applicable.

    $ gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.screensaver picture-uri

    If properly configured, the output should be "''".

    To ensure that users cannot set the screensaver background, run the following:

    $ grep picture-uri /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/*

    If properly configured, the output should be "/org/gnome/desktop/screensaver/picture-uri".

    If it is not set or configured properly, this is a finding.
