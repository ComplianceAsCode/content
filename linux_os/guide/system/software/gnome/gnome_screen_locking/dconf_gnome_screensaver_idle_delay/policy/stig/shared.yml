srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must automatically lock graphical user sessions after 15 minutes of inactivity.

vuldiscussion: |-
    A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from
    the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does not logout because of the
    temporary nature of the absence. Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their operating
    system session prior to vacating the vicinity, GNOME3 can be configured to identify when
    a user's session has idled and take action to initiate a session lock.

checktext: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} initiates a session lock after a 15-minute period of inactivity for graphical user interfaces with the following command:

    Note: This requirement assumes the use of the {{{ full_name }}} default graphical user interface, Gnome Shell. If the system does not have any graphical user interface installed, this requirement is Not Applicable.

    $ sudo gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.session idle-delay

    uint32 900

    If "idle-delay" is set to "0" or a value greater than "900", this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to initiate a screensaver after a 15-minute period of inactivity for graphical user interfaces.

    Create a database to contain the system-wide screensaver settings (if it does not already exist) with the following command:

    $ sudo touch /etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-screensaver

    Edit /etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-screensaver and add or update the following lines:

    [org/gnome/desktop/session]
    # Set the lock time out to 900 seconds before the session is considered idle
    idle-delay=uint32 900

    Update the system databases:

    $ sudo dconf update
