    {{{ full_name }}} must prevent a user from overriding the session idle-delay setting for the graphical user interface.

vuldiscussion: |-
    A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does not logout because of the temporary nature of the absence. Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their operating system session prior to vacating the vicinity, the GNOME desktop can be configured to identify when a user's session has idled and take action to initiate the session lock. As such, users should not be allowed to change session settings.

    Note: This requirement assumes the use of the {{{ full_name }}} default graphical user interface, the GNOME desktop environment. If the system does not have any graphical user interface installed, this requirement is Not Applicable.

    Verify {{{ full_name }}} prevents a user from overriding settings for graphical user interfaces.

    $ gsettings writable org.gnome.desktop.session idle-delay

    false

    If "idle-delay" is writable and the result is "true", this is a finding.

    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to prevent a user from overriding settings for graphical user interfaces.

    Create a database to contain the systemwide screensaver settings (if it does not already exist) with the following command:

    Note: The example below is using the database "local" for the system. If the system is using another database in "/etc/dconf/profile/user", the file should be created under the appropriate subdirectory.

    $ sudo touch /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/session

    Add the following setting to prevent nonprivileged users from modifying it:

    /org/gnome/desktop/session/idle-delay

    Run the following command to update the database:

    $ sudo dconf update
