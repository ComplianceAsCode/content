title: 'Enable GNOME3 Screensaver Idle Activation'

description: |-
    To activate the screensaver in the GNOME3 desktop after a period of inactivity,
    add or set <tt>idle-activation-enabled</tt> to <tt>true</tt> in
    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:
    <pre>[org/gnome/desktop/screensaver]
    idle-activation-enabled=true</pre>
    Once the setting has been added, add a lock to
    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent user modification.
    For example:
    <pre>/org/gnome/desktop/screensaver/idle-activation-enabled</pre>
    After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.

rationale: |-
    A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate
    physical vicinity of the information system but does not logout because of the temporary nature of the absence.
    Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their operating system session prior to vacating the vicinity,
    GNOME desktops can be configured to identify when a user's session has idled and take action to initiate the
    session lock.
    <br /><br />
    Enabling idle activation of the screensaver ensures the screensaver will
    be activated after the idle delay.  Applications requiring continuous,
    real-time screen display (such as network management products) require the
    login session does not have administrator rights and the display station is located in a
    controlled-access area.

    If properly configured, the output should be <tt>true</tt>.
    To ensure that users cannot disable the screensaver idle inactivity setting, run the following:
    <pre>$ grep idle-activation-enabled /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/*</pre>
