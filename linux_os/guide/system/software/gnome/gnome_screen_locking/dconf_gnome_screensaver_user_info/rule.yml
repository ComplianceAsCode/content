title: 'Disable Full User Name on Splash Shield'

description: |-
    By default when the screen is locked, the splash shield will show the user's
    full name. This should be disabled to prevent casual observers from seeing
    who has access to the system. This can be disabled by adding or setting
    <tt>show-full-name-in-top-bar</tt> to <tt>false</tt> in
    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:
    <pre>[org/gnome/desktop/screensaver]
    show-full-name-in-top-bar=false
    </pre>
    Once the settings have been added, add a lock to
    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent user modification.
    For example:
    <pre>/org/gnome/desktop/screensaver/show-full-name-in-top-bar</pre>
    After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Setting the splash screen to not reveal the logged in user's name
    conceals who has access to the system from passersby.

ocil: |-
    To ensure the splash screen is configured not to show user name, run the following command:
    <pre>$ gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.screensaver show-full-name-in-top-bar</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should be <tt>false</tt>.
    To ensure that users cannot enable user name on the lock screen, run the following:
    <pre>$ grep show-full-name-in-top-bar /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/*</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should be <tt>/org/gnome/desktop/screensaver/show-full-name-in-top-bar</tt>
