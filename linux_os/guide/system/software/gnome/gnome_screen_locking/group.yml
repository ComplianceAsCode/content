description: |-
{{% if product == "rhel6" %}}
    In the default GNOME desktop, the screen can be locked
    by choosing <b>Lock Screen</b> from the <b>System</b> menu.
    <br /><br />
    The <tt>gconftool-2</tt> program can be used to enforce mandatory
    screen locking settings for the default GNOME environment.
    The
    following sections detail commands to enforce idle activation of the screensaver,
    screen locking, a blank-screen screensaver, and an idle
    activation time.

    <br /><br />
    Because users should be trained to lock the screen when they
    step away from the computer, the automatic locking feature is only
    meant as a backup. The <b>Lock Screen</b> icon from the <b>System</b> menu can
    also be dragged to the taskbar in order to facilitate even more
    convenient screen-locking.
    <br /><br />
    The root account cannot be screen-locked, but this should
    have no practical effect as the root account should <i>never</i> be used
    to log into an X Windows environment, and should only be used to
    for direct login via console in emergency circumstances.
    <br /><br />
