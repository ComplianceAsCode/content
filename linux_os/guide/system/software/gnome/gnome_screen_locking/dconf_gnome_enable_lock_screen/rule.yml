title: 'Enable GNOME3 Lock Screen'

description: |-
    To activate the GNOME3 lock screen, make sure that the GNOME <tt>disable-lock-screen</tt> setting in <tt>org.gnome.desktop.lockdown</tt> is set to <tt>false</tt> for every user:
    <pre>gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.lockdown disable-lock-screen
    false</pre>

    To activate the lock screen for an existing user, run:
    <pre>gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.lockdown disable-lock-screen false</pre>


    To activate the lock screen by default, add or set <tt>disable-lock-screen</tt> to <tt>false</tt> in
    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:
    <pre>[org/gnome/desktop/lockdown]
    disable-lock-screen=false
    </pre>

    Once the settings have been added, you can add a lock to
    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent user modification.
    For example:
    <pre>/org/gnome/desktop/lockdown/disable-lock-screen</pre>

    After the global settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.

rationale: |-
    A session lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity
    of the information system but does not want to logout because of the temporary nature of the absense.
