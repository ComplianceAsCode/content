title: 'Disable the GNOME3 Login Restart and Shutdown Buttons'

description: "In the default graphical environment, users logging\ndirectly into the system are greeted with a login screen that allows\nany user, known or unknown, the ability the ability to shutdown or restart\nthe system. This functionality should be disabled by setting \n<tt>disable-restart-buttons</tt> to <tt>true</tt>.\n<br /><br />\nTo disable, add or edit <tt>disable-restart-buttons</tt> to\n<tt>/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:\n<pre>[org/gnome/login-screen]\ndisable-restart-buttons=true</pre>\nOnce the setting has been added, add a lock to\n<tt>/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent user modification.\nFor example:\n<pre>/org/gnome/login-screen/disable-restart-buttons</pre>\nAfter the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>."

rationale: |-
    A user who is at the console can reboot the system at the login screen. If restart or shutdown buttons
    are pressed at the login screen, this can create the risk of short-term loss of availability of systems
    due to reboot.
