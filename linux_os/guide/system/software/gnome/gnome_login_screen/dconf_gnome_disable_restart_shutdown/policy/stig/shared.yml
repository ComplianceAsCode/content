srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must prevent a user from overriding the disable-restart-buttons setting for the graphical user interface.

vuldiscussion: |-
    A user who is at the console can reboot the system at the login screen. If restart or shutdown buttons are pressed at the login screen, this can create the risk of short-term loss of availability of systems due to reboot.

    Note: This requirement assumes the use of the {{{ full_name }}} default graphical user interface, the GNOME desktop environment. If the system does not have any graphical user interface installed, this requirement is Not Applicable.

    Verify {{{ full_name }}} prevents a user from overriding the disable-restart-buttons setting for graphical user interfaces.

    $ gsettings writable org.gnome.login-screen disable-restart-buttons

    false

    If "disable-restart-buttons" is writable and the result is "true", this is a finding.

    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to prevent a user from overriding the disable-restart-buttons setting for graphical user interfaces.

    Create a database to contain the systemwide graphical user logon settings (if it does not already exist) with the following command:

    $ sudo touch /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/session

    Add the following line to prevent nonprivileged users from modifying it:

    /org/gnome/login-screen/disable-restart-buttons

    Run the following command to update the database:

    $ sudo dconf update
