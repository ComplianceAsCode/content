  {{{ full_name }}} must disable the user list at logon for graphical user interfaces.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Leaving the user list enabled is a security risk since it allows anyone with physical access to the system to enumerate known user accounts without authenticated access to the system.

    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} disables the user logon list for graphical user interfaces with the following command:
    Note: This requirement assumes the use of the {{{ full_name }}} default graphical user interface, Gnome Shell. If the system does not have any graphical user interface installed, this requirement is Not Applicable.

    $ sudo gsettings get org.gnome.login-screen disable-user-list
    true

    If the setting is "false", this is a finding.

    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to disable the user list at logon for graphical user interfaces.

    Create a database to contain the system-wide screensaver settings (if it does not already exist) with the following command:
    Note: The example below is using the database "local" for the system, so if the system is using another database in "/etc/dconf/profile/user", the file should be created under the appropriate subdirectory.

    $ sudo touch /etc/dconf/db/local.d/02-login-screen

    [org/gnome/login-screen]
    disable-user-list=true

    Update the system databases:

    $ sudo dconf update
