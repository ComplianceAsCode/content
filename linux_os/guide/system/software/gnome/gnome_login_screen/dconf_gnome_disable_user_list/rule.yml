title: 'Disable the GNOME3 Login User List'

description: |-
    In the default graphical environment, users logging directly into the
    system are greeted with a login screen that displays all known users.
    This functionality should be disabled by setting <tt>disable-user-list</tt>
    to <tt>true</tt>.
    <br /><br />
    To disable, add or edit <tt>disable-user-list</tt> to
    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:
    <pre>[org/gnome/login-screen]
    disable-user-list=true</pre>
    Once the setting has been added, add a lock to
    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent
    user modification. For example:
    <pre>/org/gnome/login-screen/disable-user-list</pre>
    After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Leaving the user list enabled is a security risk since it allows anyone
    with physical access to the system to quickly enumerate known user accounts
    without logging in.

ocil: |-
    To ensure the user list is disabled, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep disable-user-list /etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/*</pre>
    The output should be <tt>true</tt>.
    To ensure that users cannot enable displaying the user list, run the following:
    <pre>$ grep disable-user-list /etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/locks/*</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should be <tt>/org/gnome/login-screen/disable-user-list</tt>
