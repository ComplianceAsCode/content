title: 'Disable the User List'

description: |-
    In the default graphical environment, users logging
    directly into the system are greeted with a login screen that displays
    all known users. This functionality should be disabled.
    <br /><br />
    Run the following command to disable the user list:
    <pre>$ sudo gconftool-2 --direct \
      --config-source xml:readwrite:/etc/gconf/gconf.xml.mandatory \
      --type bool \
      --set /apps/gdm/simple-greeter/disable_user_list true</pre>

rationale: |-
    Leaving the user list enabled is a security risk since it allows anyone
    with physical access to the system to quickly enumerate known user accounts
    without logging in.
