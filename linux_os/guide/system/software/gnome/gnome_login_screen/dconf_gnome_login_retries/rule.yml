title: 'Set the GNOME3 Login Number of Failures'

description: |-
    In the default graphical environment, the GNOME3 login
    screen and be configured to restart the authentication process after
    a configured number of attempts. This can be configured by setting
    <tt>allowed-failures</tt> to <tt>3</tt> or less.
    <br /><br />
    To enable, add or edit <tt>allowed-failures</tt> to
    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:
    <pre>[org/gnome/login-screen]
    allowed-failures=3</pre>
    Once the setting has been added, add a lock to
    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent user modification.
    For example:
    <pre>/org/gnome/login-screen/allowed-failures</pre>
    After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Setting the password retry prompts that are permitted on a per-session basis to a low value
    requires some software, such as SSH, to re-connect. This can slow down and
    draw additional attention to some types of password-guessing attacks.

ocil: |-
    To ensure the login screen resets after a specified number of failures,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep allowed-failures /etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/*</pre>
    The output should be <tt>3</tt> or less.
    To ensure that users cannot change or configure the resets after a specified
    number of failures on the login screen, run the following:
    <pre>$ grep allowed-failures /etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/locks/*</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should be <tt>/org/gnome/login-screen/allowed-failures</tt>
