    {{{ full_name }}} must prevent a user from overriding the disabling of the graphical user martcard removal action.

vuldiscussion: |-
    A session lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does not want to log out because of the temporary nature of the absence.

    The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined. Rather than be forced to wait for a period of time to expire before the user session can be locked, {{{ full_name }}} needs to provide users with the ability to manually invoke a session lock so users can secure their session if it is necessary to temporarily vacate the immediate physical vicinity.

    Verify {{{ full_name }}} disables ability of the user to override the smartcard removal action setting.

    Determine which profile the system database is using with the following command:

    $ sudo grep system-db /etc/dconf/profile/user

    system-db:local

    Check that the removal action setting is locked from non-privileged user modification with the following command:

    Note: The example below is using the database "local" for the system, so the path is "/etc/dconf/db/local.d". This path must be modified if a database other than "local" is being used.

    $ grep 'removal-action' /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/*

    /org/gnome/settings-daemon/peripherals/smartcard/removal-action

    If the command does not return at least the example result, this is a finding.

    Add the following line to "/etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock" to prevent user override of the smartcard removal action:

    /org/gnome/settings-daemon/peripherals/smartcard/removal-action

    Then update the dconf system databases:

    $ sudo dconf update
