description: |-
    XDMCP is an unencrypted protocol, and therefore, presents a security risk, see e.g.
    {{{ weblink("https://help.gnome.org/admin/gdm/stable/security.html.en_GB#xdmcpsecurity", "XDMCP Gnome docs") }}}.

    To disable XDMCP support in Gnome, set <code>Enable</code> to <code>false</code> under the <code>[xdmcp]</code> configuration section in <code>{{{ gdm_conf_path }}}</code>. For example:
    <pre>
    [xdmcp]
    Enable=false
    </pre>

rationale: |-
    XDMCP provides unencrypted remote access through the Gnome Display Manager (GDM) which does
    not provide for the confidentiality and integrity of user passwords or the
    remote session. If a privileged user were to login using XDMCP, the
    privileged user password could be compromised due to typed XEvents
    and keystrokes will traversing over the network in clear text.

ocil_clause: 'the Enable is not set to false or is missing in the xdmcp section of the {{{ gdm_conf_path }}} gdm configuration file'

ocil: |-
    To ensure that XDMCP is disabled in <code>{{{ gdm_conf_path }}}</code>, run the following command:
    <pre>grep -Pzo "\[xdmcp\]\nEnable=false" {{{ gdm_conf_path }}}</pre>
    The output should return the following:
    <pre>
    [xdmcp]
    Enable=false
    </pre>

# There is a gdm platform implied by the parent group.
