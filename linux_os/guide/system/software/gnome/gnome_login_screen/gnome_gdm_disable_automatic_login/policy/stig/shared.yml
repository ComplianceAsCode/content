    Failure to restrict system access to authenticated users negatively impacts operating system security.

    Verify {{{ full_name }}} does not allow an unattended or automatic logon to the system via a graphical user interface.

    Note: This requirement assumes the use of the default graphical user interface, Gnome Shell. If the system does not have any graphical user interface installed, this requirement is Not Applicable.

    Check for the value of the "AutomaticLoginEnable" in the "/etc/gdm/custom.conf" file with the following command:

    $  grep -Pzoi "^\[daemon]\\nautomaticlogin.*" /etc/gdm/custom.conf

    [daemon]
    AutomaticLoginEnable=false

    If the value of "AutomaticLoginEnable" is not set to "false", this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the Gnome display manager to disable automatic login.

    Set AutomaticLoginEnable to false in the [daemon] section in /etc/gdm/custom.conf. For example:

    [daemon]
    AutomaticLoginEnable=false
