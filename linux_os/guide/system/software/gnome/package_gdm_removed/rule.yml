title: 'Remove the GDM Package Group'

description: |-
    By removing the <tt>gdm</tt> package, the system no longer has GNOME installed
    installed. If X Windows is not installed then the system cannot boot into graphical user mode.
    This prevents the system from being accidentally or maliciously booted into a <tt>graphical.target</tt>
    mode. To do so, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo yum remove gdm</pre>

rationale: |-
    Unnecessary service packages must not be installed to decrease the attack surface of the system.
    A graphical environment is unnecessary for certain types of systems including a virtualization
    hypervisor.
