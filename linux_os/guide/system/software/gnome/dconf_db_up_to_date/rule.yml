title: 'Make sure that the dconf databases are up-to-date with regards to respective keyfiles'

description: |-
    By default, DConf uses a binary database as a data backend.
    The system-level database is compiled from keyfiles in the /etc/dconf/db/
    directory by the <pre>dconf update</pre> command. More specifically, content present
    in the following directories:
    <pre>/etc/dconf/db/{{{dconf_gdm_dir}}}</pre>
    <pre>/etc/dconf/db/local.d</pre>

rationale: |-
    Unlike text-based keyfiles, the binary database is impossible to check by OVAL.
    Therefore, in order to evaluate dconf configuration, both have to be true at the same time -
    configuration files have to be compliant, and the database needs to be more recent than those keyfiles,
    which gives confidence that it reflects them.
