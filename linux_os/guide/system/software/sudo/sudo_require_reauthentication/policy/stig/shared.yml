    {{{ full_name }}} must require re-authentication when using the "sudo" command.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Without re-authentication, users may access resources or perform tasks for which they do not have authorization.

    When operating systems provide the capability to escalate a functional capability, it is critical the organization requires the user to re-authenticate when using the "sudo" command.

    If the value is set to an integer less than 0, the user's time stamp will not expire and the user will not have to re-authenticate for privileged actions until the user's session is terminated.

    Verify {{{ full_name }}} requires re-authentication when using the "sudo" command to elevate privileges with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -i 'timestamp_timeout' /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d/*

    /etc/sudoers:Defaults timestamp_timeout=0

    If results are returned from more than one file location, this is a finding.

    If "timestamp_timeout" is set to a negative number, is commented out, or no results are returned, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to re-authenticate "sudo" commands after the specified timeout:

    Add the following line to "/etc/sudoers":

    Defaults timestamp_timeout=0
