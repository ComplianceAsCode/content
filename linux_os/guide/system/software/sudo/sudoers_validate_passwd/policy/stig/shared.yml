    Verify that the sudoers security policy is configured to use the invoking user's password for privilege escalation with the following command:

    $ sudo egrep -i '(!rootpw|!targetpw|!runaspw)' /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d/* | grep -v '#'

    /etc/sudoers:Defaults !targetpw
    /etc/sudoers:Defaults !rootpw
    /etc/sudoers:Defaults !runaspw

    If no results are returned, this is a finding.
    If results are returned from more than one file location, this is a finding.
    If "Defaults !targetpw" is not defined, this is a finding.
    If "Defaults !rootpw" is not defined, this is a finding.
    If "Defaults !runaspw" is not defined, this is a finding.
