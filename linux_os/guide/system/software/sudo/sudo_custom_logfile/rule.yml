title: 'Ensure Sudo Logfile Exists - sudo logfile'

description: |-
    A custom log sudo file can be configured with the 'logfile' tag. This rule configures
    a sudo custom logfile at the default location suggested by CIS, which uses
    /var/log/sudo.log.

rationale: |-
    A sudo log file simplifies auditing of sudo commands.

ocil_clause: 'logfile is not enabled in sudo'

ocil: |-
    To determine if <tt>logfile</tt> has been configured for sudo, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep -ri "^[\s]*Defaults\s*\blogfile\b.*" /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d/</pre>
    The command should return a matching output.

        option: logfile
        # In this rule it is necessary to collect the current value and compare with an XCCDF
        # variable, which includes the expected file path. Therefore, it is first necessary to
        # extract the file path from the configuration line. This is done with the regex informed
        # in option_regex_suffix.

        # For illustration, these are few examples of a valid configuration lines:
        # Defaults logfile=/var/log/sudo.log
        # Defaults logfile = /var/log/sudo.log,noexec
        # Defaults logfile="/var/log/sudo.log"
        # In these examples it is necessary to extract '/var/log/sudo.log' from the line.
        # The regex below ensure the file path is collected in these possible scenarios.
