title: 'Ensure sudo only includes the default configuration directory'

description: |-
    Administrators can configure authorized <tt>sudo</tt> users via drop-in files, and it is possible to include
    other directories and configuration files from the file currently being parsed.
  
    Make sure that <tt>/etc/sudoers</tt> only includes drop-in configuration files from <tt>/etc/sudoers.d</tt>.
    The <tt>/etc/sudoers</tt> should contain only one <tt>#includedir</tt> directive pointing to
    <tt>/etc/sudoers.d</tt>, and no file in <tt>/etc/sudoers.d/</tt> should include other files or directories.
    Note that the '#' character doesn't denote a comment in the configuration file.

rationale: |-
   Some <tt>sudo</tt> configurtion options allow users to run programs without re-authenticating.
   Use of these configuration options makes it easier for one compromised accound to be used to
   compromise other accounts.

ocil_clause: "the /etc/sudoers doesn't include /etc/sudores.d or includes other directories?"

ocil: |-
    To determine whether <tt>sudo</tt> command includes configuration files from the appropriate directory,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep -rP '^#include(dir)?' /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d</pre>
    If only the line <tt>/etc/sudoers:#includedir /etc/sudoers.d</tt> is returned, then the drop-in include configuration is set correctly.
    Any other line returned is a finding.
