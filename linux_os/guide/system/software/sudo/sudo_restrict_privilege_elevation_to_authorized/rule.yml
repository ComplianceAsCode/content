title: 'The operating system must restrict privilege elevation to authorized personnel'

prodtype: ol7,ol8,rhel7,rhel8,sle15

description: |-
    The sudo command allows a user to execute programs with elevated
    (administrator) privileges. It prompts the user for their password
    and confirms your request to execute a command by checking a file,
    called sudoers.
    Restrict privileged actions by removing the following entries from the sudoers file:
    <tt>ALL ALL=(ALL) ALL</tt>
    <tt>ALL ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL</tt>

rationale: |-
    If the "sudoers" file is not configured correctly, any user defined
    on the system can initiate privileged actions on the target system.

ocil_clause: '/etc/sudoers file does not restrict sudo access to authorized personnel'

ocil: |-
    To determine if "sudoers" file, restricts sudo access, run the following commands:
    <pre>$ sudo grep -PR '^\s*ALL\s+ALL\=\(ALL\)\s+ALL\s*$' /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d/*</pre>
    <pre>$ sudo grep -PR '^\s*ALL\s+ALL\=\(ALL\:ALL\)\s+ALL\s*$' /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d/*</pre>
    Both commands should return no output.

platform: sudo

warnings:
- general: |-
    This rule doesn't come with a remediation, as the exact requirement allows exceptions,
    and removing lines from the sudoers file can make the system non-administrable.
