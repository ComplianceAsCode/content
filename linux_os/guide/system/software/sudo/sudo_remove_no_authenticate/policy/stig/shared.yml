    {{{ full_name }}} must require users to reauthenticate for privilege escalation.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Without re-authentication, users may access resources or perform tasks for which they
    do not have authorization.

    When operating systems provide the capability to escalate a functional capability, it
    is critical that the user re-authenticate.

checktext: |-
    Verify that "/etc/sudoers" has no occurrences of "!authenticate" with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -i !authenticate /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d/*

    If any occurrences of "!authenticate" are returned, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to not allow users to execute privileged actions without authenticating.

    Remove any occurrence of "!authenticate" found in "/etc/sudoers" file or files in the "/etc/sudoers.d" directory.

    $ sudo sed -i '/\!authenticate/ s/^/# /g' /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d/*
