title: "Don't target root user in the sudoers file"

description: |-
    The targeted users of a user specification should be, as much as possible, non privileged users (i.e.: non-root).

    User specifications have to explicitly list the runas spec (i.e. the list of target users that can be impersonated), and <tt>ALL</tt> or <tt>root</tt> should not be used.

rationale: |-
    It is common that the command to be executed does not require superuser rights (editing a file
    whose the owner is not root, sending a signal to an unprivileged process,etc.). In order to limit
    any attempt of privilege escalation through a command, it is better to apply normal user rights.

# The second part of the sentence explaining what got wrong.
# ... Is it the case that <YOUR ocil_clause>
ocil_clause: '/etc/sudoers file contains rules that allow non-root users to run commands as root'

# A setp-by-step guide how to modify the configuration to achieve compliance
ocil: |-
    To determine if the users are allowed to run commands as root, run the following commands:
    <pre>$ sudo grep -PR '^\s*((?!root\b)[\w]+)\s*(\w+)\s*=\s*(.*,)?\s*[^\(\s]' /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d/</pre>
    and
    <pre>$ sudo grep -PR '^\s*((?!root\b)[\w]+)\s*(\w+)\s*=\s*(.*,)?\s*\([\w\s]*\b(root|ALL)\b[\w\s]*\)' /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d/</pre>
    Both commands should return no output.

platform: package[sudo]

warnings:
  - general: This rule doesn't come with a remediation, as the exact requirement allows exceptions, and removing lines from the sudoers file can make the system non-administrable.
