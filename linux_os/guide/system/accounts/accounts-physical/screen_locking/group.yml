title: 'Configure Screen Locking'

description: |-
    When a user must temporarily leave an account
    logged-in, screen locking should be employed to prevent passersby
    from abusing the account. User education and training is
    particularly important for screen locking to be effective, and policies
    can be implemented to reinforce this.
    <br /><br />
    Automatic screen locking is only meant as a safeguard for
    those cases where a user forgot to lock the screen.
