title: 'Configure the tmux lock session key binding'

description: |-
    To set a key binding for the screen locking in <tt>tmux</tt> terminal multiplexer,
    the <tt>session-lock</tt> command must be bound to a key.
    Add the following line to <tt>/etc/tmux.conf</tt>:
    <pre>bind X lock-session</pre>.
    The console can now be locked with the following key combination:
    <pre>Ctrl+b Shift+x</pre>

rationale: |-
    The <tt>tmux</tt> package allows for a session lock to be implemented and configured.
    However, the session lock is implemented by an external command. The <tt>tmux</tt>
    default configuration does not contain an effective session lock.
