    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to initialize the tmux terminal multiplexer as each shell is called by adding the following to file "/etc/profile.d/tmux.sh":

    if [ "$PS1" ]; then
        parent=$(ps -o ppid= -p $$)
        name=$(ps -o comm= -p $parent)
        case "$name" in sshd|login) tmux ;; esac
    fi

    Verify {{{ full_name }}} shell initialization file is configured to start each shell with the tmux terminal multiplexer.

    Determine the location of the tmux script with the following command:

    $ sudo grep tmux /etc/bashrc /etc/profile.d/*

    /etc/profile.d/tmux.sh:  case "$name" in (sshd|login) tmux ;; esac

    Review the tmux script by using the following example:

    $ cat /etc/profile.d/tmux.sh

    If [ "$PS1" ]; then
    parent=$(ps -o ppid= -p $$)
    name=$(ps -o comm= -p $parent)
    case "$name" in (sshd|login) tmux ;; esac
    fi

    If the shell file is not configured as the example above, is commented out, or is missing, this is a finding.

    Determine if tmux is currently running with the following command:

    $ sudo ps all | grep tmux | grep -v grep

    If the command does not produce output, this is a finding.

    Tmux is a terminal multiplexer that enables a number of terminals to be created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen. Red Hat endorses tmux as the recommended session controlling package.
