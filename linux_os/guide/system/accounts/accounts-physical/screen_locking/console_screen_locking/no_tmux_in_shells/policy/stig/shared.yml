    {{{ full_name }}} must prevent users from disabling session control mechanisms.

vuldiscussion: |-
    The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined. Rather than be forced to wait for a period of time to expire before the user session can be locked, {{{ full_name }}} needs to provide users with the ability to manually invoke a session lock so users can secure their session if it is necessary to temporarily vacate the immediate physical vicinity.

    Tmux is a terminal multiplexer that enables a number of terminals to be created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen.  Red Hat endorses tmux as the recommended session controlling package.

    Verify {{{ full_name }}} prevents users from disabling the tmux terminal multiplexer with the following command:

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to prevent users from disabling the tmux terminal multiplexer by editing the "/etc/shells" configuration file to remove any instances of tmux.
