title: 'Configure Console Screen Locking'

description: |-
    A console screen locking mechanism is a temporary action taken when a user
    stops work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the
    information system but does not logout because of the temporary nature of
    the absence. Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their
    operation system session prior to vacating the vicinity, operating systems
    need to be able to identify when a user's session has idled and take action
    to initiate the session lock.
