title: 'Install the tmux Package'

description: |-
    To enable console screen locking, install the <tt>tmux</tt> package.
    A session lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does not want to log out because of the temporary nature of the absence.
    The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined.
    Rather than be forced to wait for a period of time to expire before the user session can be locked, {{{ full_name }}} needs to provide users with the ability to manually invoke a session lock so users can secure their session if it is necessary to temporarily vacate the immediate physical vicinity.
    Instruct users to begin new terminal sessions with the following command:
    <pre>$ tmux</pre>
    The console can now be locked with the following key combination:
    <pre>ctrl+b :lock-session</pre>

rationale: |-
    A session time-out lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate
    physical vicinity of the information system but does not logout because of the temporary nature of the absence.
    Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their operation system session prior to vacating the vicinity,
    operating systems need to be able to identify when a user's session has idled and take action to initiate the
    session lock.
    <br /><br />
    The <tt>tmux</tt> package allows for a session lock to be implemented and configured.
