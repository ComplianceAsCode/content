    {{{ full_name }}} must enable a user session lock until that user re-establishes access using established identification and authentication procedures for command line sessions.

vuldiscussion: |-
    A session lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does not want to log out because of the temporary nature of the absence.

    The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined. Rather than be forced to wait for a period of time to expire before the user session can be locked, {{{ full_name }}} must provide users with the ability to manually invoke a session lock so users can secure their session if it is necessary to temporarily vacate the immediate physical vicinity.

    The "tmux" package allows for a session lock to be implemented and configured. However, the session lock is implemented by an external command. The "tmux" default configuration does not contain an effective session lock.

    Verify {{{ full_name }}} enables the user to initiate a session lock with the following command:

    $ grep lock-command /etc/tmux.conf

    set -g lock-command vlock

    If the "lock-command" is not set in the global settings to call "vlock", this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to allow a user to initiate a sessions lock by adding the following line to the file "/etc/tmux.conf":

     set -g lock-command vlock
