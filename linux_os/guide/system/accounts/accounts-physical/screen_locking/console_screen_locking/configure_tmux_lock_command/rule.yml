title: 'Configure the tmux Lock Command'

description: |-
    To enable console screen locking in <tt>tmux</tt> terminal multiplexer,
    the <tt>vlock</tt> command must be configured to be used as a locking
    mechanism.
    Add the following line to <tt>/etc/tmux.conf</tt>:
    <pre>set -g lock-command vlock</pre>.
    The console can now be locked with the following key combination:
    <pre>ctrl+b :lock-session</pre>

rationale: |-
    The <tt>tmux</tt> package allows for a session lock to be implemented and configured.
    However, the session lock is implemented by an external command. The <tt>tmux</tt>
    default configuration does not contain an effective session lock.

    To verify that vlock is configured as a locking mechanism in tmux, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep lock-command /etc/tmux.conf</pre>
    The output should return the following:
    <pre>set -g lock-command vlock</pre>
