title: 'Support session locking with tmux'

description: |-
    The <tt>tmux</tt> terminal multiplexer is used to implement
    automatic session locking. It should be started from
    <tt>/etc/bashrc</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Unlike <tt>bash</tt> itself, the <tt>tmux</tt> terminal multiplexer
    provides a mechanism to lock sessions after period of inactivity.

ocil_clause: 'exec tmux is not present at the end of bashrc'

ocil: |-
    To verify that tmux is configured to execute,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ tail -1 /etc/bashrc</pre>
    The output should return the following:
    <pre>[ -n "$PS1" -a -z "$TMUX" ] &amp;&amp; exec tmux</pre>
