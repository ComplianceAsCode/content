    {{{ full_name }}} must ensure session control is automatically started at shell initialization.

vuldiscussion: |-
    A session lock is a temporary action taken when a user stops work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information system but does not want to log out because of the temporary nature of the absence.

    The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined. Rather than be forced to wait for a period of time to expire before the user session can be locked, {{{ full_name }}} must provide users with the ability to manually invoke a session lock so users can secure their session if it is necessary to temporarily vacate the immediate physical vicinity.

    The "tmux" package allows for a session lock to be implemented and configured. However, the session lock is implemented by an external command. The "tmux" default configuration does not contain an effective session lock.

    Verify {{{ full_name }}} shell initialization file is configured to start each shell with the tmux terminal multiplexer.

    Determine the location of the tmux script with the following command:

    $ sudo grep tmux /etc/bashrc /etc/profile.d/*

    /etc/profile.d/tmux.sh:  case "$name" in (sshd|login) exec tmux ;; esac

    Review the tmux script by using the following example:

    $ cat /etc/profile.d/tmux.sh

    If [ "$PS1" ]; then
    parent=$(ps -o ppid= -p $$)
    name=$(ps -o comm= -p $parent)
    case "$name" in (sshd|login) exec tmux ;; esac
    fi

    If the shell file is not configured as the example above, is commented out, or is missing, this is a finding.

    Determine if tmux is currently running with the following command:

    $ sudo ps all | grep tmux | grep -v grep

    If the command does not produce output, this is a finding.

    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to initialize the tmux terminal multiplexer as each shell is called by adding the flllowing to file "/etc/profile.d/tmux.sh":

    if [ "$PS1" ]; then
        parent=$(ps -o ppid= -p $$)
        name=$(ps -o comm= -p $parent)
        case "$name" in sshd|login) exec tmux ;; esac
    fi
