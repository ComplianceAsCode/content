title: 'Enable Smart Card Logins in PAM'

description: |-
    This requirement only applies to components where this is specific to the
    function of the device or has the concept of an organizational user (e.g.,
    VPN, proxy capability). This does not apply to authentication for the
    purpose of configuring the device itself (management).

    Check that the <tt>pam_pkcs11.so</tt> option is configured in the
    <tt>etc/pam.d/common-auth</tt> file with the following command:

    <pre># grep pam_pkcs11.so /etc/pam.d/common-auth

    auth sufficient pam_pkcs11.so</pre>

rationale: |-
    Smart card login provides two-factor authentication stronger than
    that provided by a username and password combination. Smart cards leverage PKI
    (public key infrastructure) in order to provide and verify credentials.

    Using an authentication device, such as a CAC or token that is separate
    from the information system, ensures that even if the information system is
    compromised, that compromise will not affect credentials stored on the
    authentication device.

    Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from information
    systems gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens providing
    time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such as the
    U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD Common
    Access Card.

ocil_clause: 'non-exempt accounts are not using CAC authentication'

ocil: |-
    Remote access is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an
    authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an
    external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods
    include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

    This requirement only applies to components where this is specific to the
    function of the device or has the concept of an organizational user (e.g.,
    VPN, proxy capability). This does not apply to authentication for the
    purpose of configuring the device itself (management).

    Check that the <tt>pam_pkcs11.so</tt> option is configured in the
    <tt>etc/pam.d/common-auth</tt> file with the following command:

    <pre># grep pam_pkcs11.so /etc/pam.d/common-auth

    auth sufficient pam_pkcs11.so</pre>

    If <tt>pam_pkcs11.so</tt> is not set in <tt>etc/pam.d/common-auth</tt> this
    is a finding.
