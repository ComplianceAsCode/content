title: "Verify that 'use_mappers' is set to 'pwent' in PAM"

description: |-
    The operating system must map the authenticated identity to the user or
    group account for PKI-based authentication.

    Verify that <tt>use_mappers</tt> is set to <tt>pwent</tt> in
    <tt>/etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf</tt> file with the following command:

    <pre>$ grep ^use_mappers /etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf

    use_mappers = pwent</pre>

rationale: |-
    Without mapping the certificate used to authenticate to the user account,
    the ability to determine the identity of the individual user or group will
    not be available for forensic analysis.
