title: 'Install the opensc Package For Multifactor Authentication'

description: |-
    {{{ describe_package_install(package="opensc") }}}

rationale: |-
    Using an authentication device, such as a CAC or token that is separate from
    the information system, ensures that even if the information system is
    compromised, that compromise will not affect credentials stored on the
    authentication device.
    <br /><br />
    Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from
    information systems gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens
    providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such
    as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD Common
    Access Card.
