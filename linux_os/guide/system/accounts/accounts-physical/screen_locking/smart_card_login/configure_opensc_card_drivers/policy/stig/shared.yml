    Smart card login provides two-factor authentication stronger than
    that provided by a username and password combination. Smart cards leverage public key infrastructure in order to provide and verify credentials.
    Configuring the smart card driver in use by your organization helps to prevent users from using unauthorized smart cards.

    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} loads the cac driver with the following command:

    $ grep card_drivers /etc/opensc.conf

    card_drivers = cac;

    If "cac" is not listed as a card driver, or there is no line returned for "card_drivers", this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to load the cac driver.

    Add, or modify the following line in the "/etc/opensc.conf" file:

    card_drivers = cac;
