title: 'Configure Smart Card Certificate Authority Validation'

description: |-
    Configure the operating system to do certificate status checking for PKI
    authentication. Modify all of the <tt>cert_policy</tt> lines in
    <tt>/etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf</tt> to include <tt>ca</tt> like so:
    <pre>cert_policy = ca, ocsp_on, signature;</pre>

rationale: |-
    Using an authentication device, such as a CAC or token that is separate from
    the information system, ensures that even if the information system is
    compromised, that compromise will not affect credentials stored on the
    authentication device.
    <br /><br />
    Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from
    information systems gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens
    providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such
    as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card and the DoD Common
    Access Card.

ocil_clause: 'ca is not configured'

ocil: |-
    To verify the operating system implements certificate status checking for PKI
    authentication, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep -i cert_policy /etc/pam_pkcs11/pam_pkcs11.conf</pre>
    The output should return multiple lines similiar to the following:
    <pre>cert_policy = ca, ocsp_on, signature;
    cert_policy = ca, ocsp_on, signature;
    cert_policy = ca, ocsp_on, signature;</pre>
