title: 'Protect Physical Console Access'

description: |-
    It is impossible to fully protect a system from an
    attacker with physical access, so securing the space in which the
    system is located should be considered a necessary step. However,
    there are some steps which, if taken, make it more difficult for an
    attacker to quickly or undetectably modify a system from its
    console.
