title: 'Disable debug-shell SystemD Service'

description: |-
    SystemD's <tt>debug-shell</tt> service is intended to
    diagnose SystemD related boot issues with various <tt>systemctl</tt>
    commands. Once enabled and following a system reboot, the root shell
    will be available on <tt>tty9</tt> which is access by pressing
    <tt>CTRL-ALT-F9</tt>. The <tt>debug-shell</tt> service should only be used
    for SystemD related issues and should otherwise be disabled.
    <br /><br />
    By default, the <tt>debug-shell</tt> SystemD service is already disabled.
    {{{ describe_service_disable(service="debug-shell") }}}

rationale: |-
    This prevents attackers with physical access from trivially bypassing security
    on the machine through valid troubleshooting configurations and gaining root
    access when the system is rebooted.
