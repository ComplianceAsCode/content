srg_requirement: |-
    The systemd Ctrl-Alt-Delete burst key sequence in {{{ full_name }}} must be disabled.

vuldiscussion: |-
    A locally logged-on user who presses Ctrl-Alt-Delete when at the console can reboot the system. If accidentally pressed, as could happen in the case of a mixed OS environment, this can create the risk of short-term loss of availability of systems due to unintentional reboot. In a graphical user environment, risk of unintentional reboot from the Ctrl-Alt-Delete sequence is reduced because the user will be prompted before any action is taken.

checktext: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} is configured to not reboot the system when Ctrl-Alt-Delete is pressed seven times within two seconds with the following command:

    $ grep -i ctrl /etc/systemd/system.conf

    CtrlAltDelBurstAction=none

    If the "CtrlAltDelBurstAction" is not set to "none", commented out, or is missing, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the system to disable the CtrlAltDelBurstAction by added or modifying the following line in the "/etc/systemd/system.conf" configuration file:

    CtrlAltDelBurstAction=none

    Reload the daemon for this change to take effect.

    $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
