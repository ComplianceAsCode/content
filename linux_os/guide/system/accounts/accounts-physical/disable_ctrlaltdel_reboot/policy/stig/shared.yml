srg_requirement: |-
    The x86 Ctrl-Alt-Delete key sequence must be disabled on {{{ full_name }}}.

vuldiscussion: |-
    A locally logged-on user who presses Ctrl-Alt-Delete when at the console can reboot the system. If accidentally pressed, as could happen in the case of a mixed OS environment, this can create the risk of short-term loss of availability of systems due to unintentional reboot. In a graphical user environment, risk of unintentional reboot from the Ctrl-Alt-Delete sequence is reduced because the user will be prompted before any action is taken.

checktext: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} is not configured to reboot the system when Ctrl-Alt-Delete is pressed with the following command:

    $ sudo systemctl status ctrl-alt-del.target

    ctrl-alt-del.target
    Loaded: masked (Reason: Unit ctrl-alt-del.target is masked.)
    Active: inactive (dead)

    If the "ctrl-alt-del.target" is loaded and not masked, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to disable the ctrl-alt-del.target with the following command:

    $ sudo systemctl disable --now ctrl-alt-del.target
    $ sudo systemctl mask --now ctrl-alt-del.target
