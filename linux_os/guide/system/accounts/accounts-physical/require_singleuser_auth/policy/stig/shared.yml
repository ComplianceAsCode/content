    {{{ full_name }}} must require authentication to access single-user mode.

vuldiscussion: |-
    To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DOD-approved PKIs, all DOD systems (e.g., web servers and web portals) must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods that do not rely solely on the possession of a certificate for access. Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement.

    This requirement prevents attackers with physical access from trivially bypassing security on the machine and gaining root access. Such accesses are further prevented by configuring the bootloader password.

    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} requires authentication for single-user mode with the following command:

    $ grep sulogin /usr/lib/systemd/system/rescue.service

    ExecStart=-/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sulogin-shell rescue

    In case the output does not match, check if the <tt>ExecStart</tt> directive is not overridden:

    grep ExecStart /etc/systemd/system/rescue.service.d/*.conf

    The output should contain two lines:
    ExecStart=
    ExecStart=-/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sulogin-shell rescue

    If the line is not returned in any of cases mentioned above, or is commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to require authentication for single-user mode.

    Add following two lines to the file "/etc/systemd/system/rescue.service.d/10-remediation.conf":

    ExecStart=
    ExecStart=-/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sulogin-shell rescue
