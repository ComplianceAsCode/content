title: 'Require Authentication for Single User Mode'

{{% if product == "rhel6" %}}
description: |-
    Single-user mode is intended as a system recovery
    method, providing a single user root access to the system by
    providing a boot option at startup. By default, no authentication
    is performed if single-user mode is selected.
    <br /><br />
    To require entry of the root password even if the system is
    started in single-user mode, add or correct the following line in the
    file <tt>/etc/sysconfig/init</tt>:
    <pre>SINGLE=/sbin/sulogin</pre>
{{% else %}}

    By default, single-user mode is protected by requiring a password and is set
    in <tt>/usr/lib/systemd/system/rescue.service</tt>.

rationale: |-
    This prevents attackers with physical access from trivially bypassing security
    on the machine and gaining root access. Such accesses are further prevented
    by configuring the bootloader password.

    To check if authentication is required for single-user mode, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep SINGLE /etc/sysconfig/init</pre>
    The output should be the following:
    <pre>SINGLE=/sbin/sulogin</pre>
{{% else %}}

    To check if authentication is required for single-user mode, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep sulogin /usr/lib/systemd/system/rescue.service</pre>
    The output should be similar to the following, and the line must begin with
    {{% if product == "fedora" -%}}
        ExecStart and /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sulogin-shell.
        <pre>ExecStart=-/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sulogin-shell rescue</pre>
