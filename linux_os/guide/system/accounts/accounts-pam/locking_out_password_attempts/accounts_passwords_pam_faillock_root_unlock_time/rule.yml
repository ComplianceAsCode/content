title: 'Set Root Lockout Time for Failed Password Attempts'

description: |-
    This rule configures the system to lock out root during a specified time period after a
    number of incorrect login attempts using <tt>pam_faillock.so</tt>.

    Ensure that the file <tt>/etc/security/faillock.conf</tt> contains the following entry:
    <tt>root_unlock_time=&lt;interval-in-seconds&gt;</tt> where
    <tt>interval-in-seconds</tt> is <tt>{{{xccdf_value("var_accounts_passwords_pam_faillock_unlock_time") }}}</tt> or greater.

    If <tt>root_unlock_time</tt> is set to <tt>0</tt>, it may enable attacker to
    apply denial of service to legitimate users.

rationale: |-
    By limiting the number of failed logon attempts the risk of unauthorized root
    access via password guessing, otherwise known as brute-forcing, is reduced.
    Limits are imposed by locking the account.
