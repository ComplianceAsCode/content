title: 'Disallow blank or null passwords in the PAM password-auth file'

description: |-
    Remove any instances of the <tt>nullok</tt> option in the
    <tt>/etc/pam.d/password-auth</tt> file to prevent logons with empty passwords.
    Note: Manual changes to the listed file may be overwritten by the
    <tt>authselect</tt> program.

rationale: |-
    If an account has an empty password, anyone could log on and run commands
    with the privileges of that account.
    Accounts with empty passwords should never be used in operational environments.

severity: high
