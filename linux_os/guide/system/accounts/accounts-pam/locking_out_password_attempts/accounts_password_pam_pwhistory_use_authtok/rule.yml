title: 'Enforce Password History with use_authtok'

description: |-
    The <tt>use_authtok</tt> option ensures the pam_pwhistory module uses the new
    password provided by a previously stacked PAM module during password
    changes, rather than prompting the user again.

rationale: |-
    The <tt>use_authtok</tt> option allows multiple PAM modules to validate the new
    password before it is accepted, ensuring it meets all security requirements
    without requiring the user to re-enter it multiple times.
