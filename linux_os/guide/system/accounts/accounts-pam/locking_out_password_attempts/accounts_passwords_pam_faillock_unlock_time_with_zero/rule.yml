title: 'Set Lockout Time for Failed Password Attempts'

description: |-
    This rule configures the system to lock out accounts during a specified time period after a
    number of incorrect login attempts using <tt>pam_faillock.so</tt>.

    Ensure that the file <tt>/etc/security/faillock.conf</tt> contains the following entry:
    <tt>unlock_time=&lt;interval-in-seconds&gt;</tt> where
    <tt>interval-in-seconds</tt> is set to <tt>0</tt> or is set to
    <tt>{{{xccdf_value("var_accounts_passwords_pam_faillock_unlock_time") }}}</tt> or greater.

    pam_faillock.so module requires multiple entries in pam files. These entries must be carefully
    defined to work as expected. In order to avoid any errors when manually editing these files,
    it is recommended to use the appropriate tools, such as <tt>authselect</tt> or <tt>authconfig</tt>,
    depending on the OS version.

    If <tt>unlock_time</tt> is set to <tt>0</tt>, manual intervention by an administrator is required
    to unlock a user. This should be done using the <tt>faillock</tt> tool.

rationale: |-
    By limiting the number of failed logon attempts the risk of unauthorized system
    access via user password guessing, otherwise known as brute-forcing, is reduced.
    Limits are imposed by locking the account.

ocil_clause: |-
    the "unlock_time" option is not set to "0" or is not set to "{{{ xccdf_value("var_accounts_passwords_pam_faillock_unlock_time") }}}",
    the line is missing, or commented out

ocil: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} is configured to lock an account until released by an administrator
    after {{{ xccdf_value("var_accounts_passwords_pam_faillock_deny") }}} unsuccessful logon
    attempts with the command:

    <pre>$ grep 'unlock_time =' /etc/security/faillock.conf</pre>
    <tt>unlock_time = {{{ xccdf_value("var_accounts_passwords_pam_faillock_unlock_time") }}}</tt>

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to lock an account until released by an administrator after
    {{{ xccdf_value("var_accounts_passwords_pam_faillock_deny") }}} unsuccessful logon attempts with the command:

    $ sudo authselect enable-feature with-faillock

    Then edit the <tt>/etc/security/faillock.conf</tt> file as follows:
    <pre>unlock_time = {{{ xccdf_value("var_accounts_passwords_pam_faillock_unlock_time") }}}</pre>

warnings:
    - general: |-
       If the system supports the new <tt>/etc/security/faillock.conf</tt> file but the
       pam_faillock.so parameters are defined directly in <tt>/etc/pam.d/system-auth</tt> and
       <tt>/etc/pam.d/password-auth</tt>, the remediation will migrate the <tt>unlock_time</tt> parameter
       to <tt>/etc/security/faillock.conf</tt> to ensure compatibility with <tt>authselect</tt> tool.
       The parameters <tt>deny</tt> and <tt>fail_interval</tt>, if used, also have to be migrated
       by their respective remediation.

    - general: |-
        If the system relies on <tt>authselect</tt> tool to manage PAM settings, the remediation
        will also use <tt>authselect</tt> tool. However, if any manual modification was made in
        PAM files, the <tt>authselect</tt> integrity check will fail and the remediation will be
        aborted in order to preserve intentional changes. In this case, an informative message will
        be shown in the remediation report.
        If the system supports the <tt>/etc/security/faillock.conf</tt> file, the pam_faillock
        parameters should be defined in <tt>faillock.conf</tt> file.
