    {{{ full_name }}} must configure the use of the pam_faillock.so module in the /etc/pam.d/password-auth file.

    Verify the pam_faillock.so module is present in the "/etc/pam.d/password-auth" file:

    auth required pam_faillock.so preauth
    auth required pam_faillock.so authfail
    account required pam_faillock.so

    If the pam_faillock.so module is not present in the "/etc/pam.d/password-auth" file with the "preauth" line listed before pam_unix.so, this is a finding.
