    {{{ full_name }}} must automatically lock an account when three unsuccessful logon attempts occur during a 15-minute time period.

vuldiscussion: |-
    By limiting the number of failed logon attempts the risk of unauthorized system
    access via user password guessing, otherwise known as brute-forcing, is reduced.
    Limits are imposed by locking the account.

    Verify {{{ full_name }}} locks an account after three unsuccessful logon attempts within a period of 15 minutes with the following command:

    Note: If the System Administrator demonstrates the use of an approved centralized account management method that locks an account after three unsuccessful logon attempts within a period of 15 minutes, this requirement is not applicable.

    $ grep fail_interval /etc/security/faillock.conf

    fail_interval = 900

    If the "fail_interval" option is not set to "900" or less (but not "0"), the line is commented out, or the line is missing, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to lock out the "root" account after a number of incorrect login attempts within 15 minutes using "pam_faillock.so", first enable the feature using the following command:

    $ authselect enable-feature with-faillock

    Then edit the "/etc/security/faillock.conf" file as follows:

    fail_interval = 900
