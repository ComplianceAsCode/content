title: 'Account Lockouts Must Persist'

description: |-
    By setting a `dir` in the faillock configuration account lockouts will persist across reboots.

rationale: |
    Having lockouts persist across reboots ensures that account is only unlocked by an administrator.
    If the lockouts did not persist across reboots an attack could simply reboot the system to continue brute force attacks against the accounts on the system.
