title: 'Ensure pam_faillock module is enabled'

description: |-
    The <tt>pam_faillock.so</tt> module maintains a list of failed authentication attempts per
    user during a specified interval and locks the account in case there were more than the
    configured number of consecutive failed authentications (this is defined by the <tt>deny</tt>
    parameter in the faillock configuration). It stores the failure records into per-user files in
    the tally directory.

rationale: |-
    Locking out user IDs after n unsuccessful consecutive login attempts mitigates brute
    force password attacks against your systems.

severity: medium

platform: package[pam]
