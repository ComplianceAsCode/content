title: 'Enforce pam_faillock for Local Accounts Only'

description: |-
    The pam_faillock module's <tt>local_users_only</tt> parameter controls requirements for
    enforcing failed lockout attempts only for local user accounts and ignoring centralized user
    account management failed attempt configurations.

rationale: |-
    The operating system must provide automated mechanisms for supporting account management
    functions. Enterprise environments make application account management challenging and
    complex. A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential
    oversight or other error. Locking out remote accounts may cause unintentional DoS.

ocil_clause: 'local_users_only is not uncommented or configured correctly'

ocil: |-
    To check if only local user are impacted by pam_faillock, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep local_users_only /etc/security/faillock.conf</pre>
    The output should return <tt>local_users_only</tt> not commented.

fixtext: |-
    To enable the <tt>local_users_only</tt> setting in <tt>/etc/security/faillock.conf</tt>,
    first enable pam_faillock.so using the following command:
    $ sudo authselect enable-feature with-faillock

    Then edit the <tt>/etc/security/faillock.conf</tt> file as follows:
    add or uncomment the following line:
    <pre>local_users_only</pre>

    add or uncomment the following line:
    <pre>silent</pre>

platform: package[pam]

warnings:
    - general: |-
        If the system relies on <tt>authselect</tt> tool to manage PAM settings, the remediation
        will also use <tt>authselect</tt> tool. However, if any manual modification was made in
        PAM files, the <tt>authselect</tt> integrity check will fail and the remediation will be
        aborted in order to preserve intentional changes. In this case, an informative message will
        be shown in the remediation report.
        If the system supports the <tt>/etc/security/faillock.conf</tt> file, the pam_faillock
        parameters should be defined in <tt>faillock.conf</tt> file.

    - management: |-
        Using this rule bypasses pam_faillock's functionality and should be used in cases
        where centralized management such as LDAP or Active Directory is in use.
