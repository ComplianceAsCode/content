title: 'Enforce pam_faillock for Local Accounts Only'

description: |-
    The pam_faillock module's <tt>local_users_only</tt> parameter controls requirements for
    enforcing failed lockout attempts only for local user accounts and ignoring
    centralized user account management failed attempt configurations. Enable the <tt>local_users_only</tt>
    setting in <tt>/etc/security/faillock.conf</tt> to require failed password attempts
    for only local user accounts.

rationale: |-
    The operating system must provide automated mechanisms for supporting account management
    functions. Enterprise environments make application account management challenging and
    complex. A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential
    oversight or other error.

ocil_clause: 'local_users_only is not uncommented or configured correctly'

ocil: |-
    To check if root user is required to use complex passwords, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep local_users_only /etc/security/faillock.conf</pre>
    The output should return <tt>local_users_only</tt> uncommented.

platform: pam

warnings:
    - management: |-
        Using this rule bypasses pam_faillock's functionality and should be used in cases
        where centralized management such as LDAP or Active Directory is in use.
