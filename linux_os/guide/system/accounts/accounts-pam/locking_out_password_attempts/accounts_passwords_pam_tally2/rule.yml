title: 'Set Deny For Failed Password Attempts'

description: |-
    The SUSE operating system must lock an account after three consecutive
    invalid access attempts.

rationale: |-
    By limiting the number of failed logon attempts, the risk of unauthorized
    system access via user password guessing, otherwise known as brute-force
    attacks, is reduced. Limits are imposed by locking the account.

    To configure the operating system to lock an account after three
    unsuccessful consecutive access attempts using <tt>pam_tally2.so</tt>,
    modify the content of both <tt>/etc/pam.d/common-auth</tt> and
    <tt>/etc/pam.d/common-account</tt> as follows:
    <br /><br />
    <ul>
    <li> add or modify the <tt>pam_tally2.so</tt> module line in
    <tt>/etc/pam.d/common-auth</tt> to ensure both <tt>onerr=fail</tt> and
    <tt>deny=3</tt> are present. For example:
    <pre>auth required pam_tally2.so onerr=fail silent audit deny=3</pre></li>
    <li> add or modify the following line in <tt>/etc/pam.d/common-account</tt>:
    <pre>account required pam_tally2.so</pre></li>
    </ul>

ocil: |-
    Check that the systems locks a user account after three consecutive failed
    login attempts with the following command:

    <pre># grep pam_tally2.so /etc/pam.d/common-auth
    auth required pam_tally2.so onerr=fail deny=3</pre>

    If no line is returned, the line is commented out, or the line is missing
    "onerr=fail", this is a finding.
    If the line has "deny" set to a value other than 1, 2, or 3, this is a
    finding.

    Check that the system resets the failed login attempts counter after a
    successful login using the following command:

    <pre># grep pam_tally2.so /etc/pam.d/common-account
    account required pam_tally2.so deny=3</pre>

    If the account option is missing, or commented out, this is a finding.
