title: 'Set Deny For Failed Password Attempts'

description: |-
    The SUSE operating system must lock an account after three consecutive invalid logon attempts.

rationale: |-
    By limiting the number of failed logon attempts, the risk of unauthorized system access via user password guessing, otherwise known as brute-force attacks, is reduced. Limits are imposed by locking the account.<br/><br/>

    Check that the systems locks a user account after three consecutive failed login attempts with the following command:

    <pre># grep pam_tally2.so /etc/pam.d/common-auth
    auth required pam_tally2.so deny=3

    # grep pam_tally2.so /etc/pam.d/common-account
    account required pam_tally2.so deny=3</pre>

    If the "deny" option in one of the files is greater than "<tt>3</tt>" or is missing, this is a finding.
