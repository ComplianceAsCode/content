    {{{ full_name }}} must configure SELinux context type to allow the use of a nondefault faillock tally directory.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Not having the correct SELinux context on the faillock directory may lead to unauthorized access to the directory.

    Verify the location of the nondefault tally directory for the pam_faillock module with the following command:

    Note: If the system does not have SELinux enabled and enforcing a targeted policy, or if the pam_faillock module is not configured for use, this requirement is Not Applicable.

    $ sudo grep -w dir /etc/security/faillock.conf

    dir = /var/log/faillock

    Check the security context type of the nondefault tally directory with the following command:

    $ ls -Zd /var/log/faillock

    unconfined_u:object_r:faillog_t:s0 /var/log/faillock

    If the security context type of the nondefault tally directory is not "faillog_t", this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to allow the use of a nondefault faillock tally directory while SELinux enforces a targeted policy.

    First enable the feature using the following command:

    $ sudo authselect enable-feature with-faillock

    Create a nondefault faillock tally directory (if it does not already exist) with the following example:

    $ sudo mkdir /var/log/faillock

    Then add/modify the "/etc/security/faillock.conf" file to match the following line:

    dir = /var/log/faillock

    Update the /etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files/file_contexts.local with "faillog_t" context type for the nondefault faillock tally directory with the following command:

    $ sudo semanage fcontext -a -t faillog_t "/var/log/faillock(/.*)?"

    Next, update the context type of the nondefault faillock directory/subdirectories and files with the following command:

    $ sudo restorecon -R -v /var/log/faillock
