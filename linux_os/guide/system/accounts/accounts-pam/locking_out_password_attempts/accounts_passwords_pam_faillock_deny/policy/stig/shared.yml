srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must automatically lock an account when three unsuccessful logon attempts occur.

vuldiscussion: |-

    Verify {{{ full_name }}} is configured to lock an account after three unsuccessful logon attempts with the command:

    $ grep 'deny =' /etc/security/faillock.conf

    deny = 3

    If the "deny" option is not set to "3" or less (but not "0"), is missing or commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
