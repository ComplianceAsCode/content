title: 'Verify pam_pwhistory module is activated'

description: |-
    The <tt>pam_pwhistory.so</tt> module is part of the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) 
    framework designed to increase password security. It works by storing a history of previously 
    used passwords for each user, ensuring users cannot alternate between the same passwords too frequently.
    <br /><br />
    This module is incompatible with Kerberos. Furthermore, its usage with <tt>NIS</tt> or <tt>LDAP</tt> is 
    generally impractical, as other machines can not access local password histories.

rationale: |-
    Enforcing strong passwords increases the difficulty and resources required 
    for password compromise.

severity: medium

platform: package[pam]
