title: 'An SELinux Context must be configured for default pam_tally2 file option'

description: |-
    The <tt>file</tt> configuration option in PAM pam_tally2.so module defines where to keep counts.
    Default is /var/log/tallylog. The configured directory must have the correct SELinux context.

rationale: |-
    Not having the correct SELinux context on the pam_tally2.so file may lead to
    unauthorized access to the directory.

ocil_clause: 'the security context type of the non-default tally directory is not "faillog_t"'

ocil: |-
    If the system does not have SELinux enabled and enforcing a targeted policy,
    or if the pam_tally2 module is not configured for use, this requirement is not applicable

    Check the security context type of the default tally2 directory with the following command:

    $ sudo ls -Z /var/log/tallylog

    unconfined_u:object_r:faillog_t:s0 /var/log/faillock

    If the security context type of the tally directory is not "faillog_t", this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Update the /etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files/file_contexts.local with "faillog_t" context
    type for the default pam_tally2 tally directory with the following command:

    $ sudo semanage fcontext -a -t faillog_t "/var/log/tallylog"

    Next, update the context type of the default tallylog directory/subdirectories and files with the following command:

    $ sudo restorecon -R -v /var/log/tallylog
