title: 'Lock Accounts Must Persist'

description: |-
    This rule ensures that the system lock out accounts using <tt>pam_faillock.so</tt> persist
    after system reboot. From "Pam_Faillock" man pages:
    <pre>Note that the default directory that "pam_faillock" uses is usually cleared on system
    boot so the access will be reenabled after system reboot. If that is undesirable, a different
    tally directory must be set with the "dir" option.</pre>

    pam_faillock.so module requires multiple entries in pam files. These entries must be carefully
    defined to work as expected. In order to avoid errors when manually editing these files, it is
    recommended to use the appropriate tools, such as <tt>authselect</tt> or <tt>authconfig</tt>,
    depending on the OS version.

rationale: |-
    Locking out user accounts after a number of incorrect attempts prevents direct password
    guessing attacks. In combination with the <tt>silent</tt> option, user enumeration attacks
    are also mitigated.

ocil: |-
    To ensure the tally directory is configured correctly, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'dir =' /etc/security/faillock.conf</pre>
    The output should show that dir is set to something different to "/var/run/faillock"

fixtext: |-
    To configure {{{ full_name }}} to persist locked out accounts after reboot using
    <tt>pam_faillock.so</tt>, first enable the feature using the following command:
    $ sudo authselect enable-feature with-faillock

    Then edit the <tt>/etc/security/faillock.conf</tt> file as follows:
    add, uncomment or edit the following line:
    <pre>dir = /var/log/faillock</pre>

warnings:
    - general: |-
        If the system relies on <tt>authselect</tt> tool to manage PAM settings, the remediation
        will also use <tt>authselect</tt> tool. However, if any manual modification was made in
        PAM files, the <tt>authselect</tt> integrity check will fail and the remediation will be
        aborted in order to preserve intentional changes. In this case, an informative message will
        be shown in the remediation report.
        If the system supports the <tt>/etc/security/faillock.conf</tt> file, the pam_faillock
        parameters should be defined in <tt>faillock.conf</tt> file.
