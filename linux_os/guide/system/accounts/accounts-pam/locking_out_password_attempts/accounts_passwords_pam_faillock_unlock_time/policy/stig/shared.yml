    {{{ full_name }}} must maintain an account lock until the locked account is released by an administrator.

vuldiscussion: |-
    By limiting the number of failed logon attempts the risk of unauthorized system

    Limits are imposed by locking the account.

    Verify {{{ full_name }}} is configured to lock an account until released by an administrator after three unsuccessful logon attempts with the command:

    $ grep 'unlock_time =' /etc/security/faillock.conf

    unlock_time = 0

    If the "unlock_time" option is not set to "0", the line is missing, or commented out, this is a finding.
