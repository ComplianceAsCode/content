title: 'Limit Password Reuse'

description: |-
    Do not allow root to reuse recent passwords. This can be
    accomplished by using the <tt>enforce_for_root</tt> option for the
    <tt>pam_pwhistory</tt> PAM modules.
    <br /><br />
    In the file <tt>/etc/pam.d/common-password</tt>, make sure the parameters
    <tt>enforce_for_root</tt> is present.

rationale: 'Preventing re-use of previous passwords helps ensure that a compromised password is not re-used by a user.'
