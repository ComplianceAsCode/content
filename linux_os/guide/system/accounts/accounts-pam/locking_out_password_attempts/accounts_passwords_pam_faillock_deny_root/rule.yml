title: 'Configure the root Account for Failed Password Attempts'

description: |-
    This rule configures the system to lock out the <tt>root</tt> account after a number of
    incorrect login attempts using <tt>pam_faillock.so</tt>.

    pam_faillock.so module requires multiple entries in pam files. These entries must be carefully
    defined to work as expected. In order to avoid errors when manually editing these files, it is
    recommended to use the appropriate tools, such as <tt>authselect</tt> or <tt>authconfig</tt>,
    depending on the OS version.

rationale: |-
    By limiting the number of failed logon attempts, the risk of unauthorized system access via
    user password guessing, also known as brute-forcing, is reduced. Limits are imposed by locking
    the account.

ocil: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} is configured to lock the root account after {{{ xccdf_value("var_accounts_passwords_pam_faillock_deny") }}}
    unsuccessful logon attempts with the command:

    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to lock out the <tt>root</tt> account after a number of incorrect login

warnings:
    - general: |-
        If the system relies on <tt>authselect</tt> tool to manage PAM settings, the remediation
        will also use <tt>authselect</tt> tool. However, if any manual modification was made in
        PAM files, the <tt>authselect</tt> integrity check will fail and the remediation will be
        aborted in order to preserve intentional changes. In this case, an informative message will
        be shown in the remediation report.
        If the system supports the <tt>/etc/security/faillock.conf</tt> file, the pam_faillock
        parameters should be defined in <tt>faillock.conf</tt> file.

srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must automatically lock the root account until the root account is released by an administrator when three unsuccessful logon attempts occur during a 15-minute time period.
