srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must automatically lock the root account until the root account is released by an administrator when three unsuccessful logon attempts occur during a 15-minute time period.

vuldiscussion: |-
    By limiting the number of failed logon attempts, the risk of unauthorized system access via
    user password guessing, also known as brute-forcing, is reduced. Limits are imposed by locking
    the account.

checktext: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} is configured to lock the root account after three unsuccessful logon attempts with the command:

    $ grep even_deny_root /etc/security/faillock.conf

    even_deny_root

    If the "even_deny_root" option is not set, is missing or commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to lock out the "root" account after a number of incorrect login
    attempts using "pam_faillock.so", first enable the feature using the following command:

    $  sudo authselect enable-feature with-faillock

     Then edit the "/etc/security/faillock.conf" file as follows:

      add or uncomment the following line:
     even_deny_root
