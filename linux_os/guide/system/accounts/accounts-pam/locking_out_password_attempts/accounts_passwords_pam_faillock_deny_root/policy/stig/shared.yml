srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must automatically lock the root account until the root account is released by an administrator when three unsuccessful logon attempts occur during a 15-minute time period.

vuldiscussion: |-
    By limiting the number of failed logon attempts, the risk of unauthorized system access via user password guessing, also known as brute-forcing, is reduced. Limits are imposed by locking the account.



checktext: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} is configured to lock the root account after three unsuccessful logon attempts with the command:

    $ sudo grep even_deny_root /etc/security/faillock.conf

    even_deny_root

    If the "even_deny_root" option is not set or is missing or commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    To configure {{{ full_name }}} to lock out the "root" account after a number of incorrect logon attempts using "pam_faillock.so", first enable the feature using the following command:

    $ sudo authselect enable-feature with-faillock

    Edit the "/etc/security/faillock.conf" by uncommenting or adding the following line:

    even_deny_root
