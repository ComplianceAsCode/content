title: 'The PAM configuration should not be changed automatically'

description: |-
    Verify the SUSE operating system is configured to not overwrite Pluggable
    Authentication Modules (PAM) configuration on package changes.


rationale: |-
    <tt>pam-config</tt> is a command line utility that automatically generates
    a system PAM configuration as packages are installed, updated or removed
    from the system. <tt>pam-config</tt> removes configurations for PAM modules
    and parameters that it does not know about. It may render ineffective PAM
    configuration by the system administrator and thus impact system security.
