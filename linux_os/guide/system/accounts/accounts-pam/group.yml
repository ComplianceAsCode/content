title: 'Protect Accounts by Configuring PAM'

description: |-
    PAM, or Pluggable Authentication Modules, is a system
    which implements modular authentication for Linux programs. PAM provides
    a flexible and configurable architecture for authentication, and it should be configured
    to minimize exposure to unnecessary risk. This section contains
    guidance on how to accomplish that.
    <br /><br />
    PAM is implemented as a set of shared objects which are
    loaded and invoked whenever an application wishes to authenticate a
    user. Typically, the application must be running as root in order
    to take advantage of PAM, because PAM's modules often need to be able
    to access sensitive stores of account information, such as /etc/shadow.
    Traditional privileged network listeners
    (e.g. sshd) or SUID programs (e.g. sudo) already meet this
    requirement. An SUID root application, userhelper, is provided so
    that programs which are not SUID or privileged themselves can still
    take advantage of PAM.
    <br /><br />
    PAM looks in the directory <tt>/etc/pam.d</tt> for
    application-specific configuration information. For instance, if
    the program login attempts to authenticate a user, then PAM's
    libraries follow the instructions in the file <tt>/etc/pam.d/login</tt>
    to determine what actions should be taken.
    <br /><br />
    One very important file in <tt>/etc/pam.d</tt> is
    <tt>/etc/pam.d/system-auth</tt>. This file, which is included by
    many other PAM configuration files, defines 'default' system authentication
    measures. Modifying this file is a good way to make far-reaching
    authentication changes, for instance when implementing a
    centralized authentication service.

warnings:
    - functionality: |-
        Be careful when making changes to PAM's configuration files.
        The syntax for these files is complex, and modifications can
        have unexpected consequences. The default configurations shipped
        with applications should be sufficient for most users.
    - functionality: |-
        Running <tt>authconfig</tt> or <tt>system-config-authentication</tt>
        will re-write the PAM configuration files, destroying any manually
        made changes and replacing them with a series of system defaults.
