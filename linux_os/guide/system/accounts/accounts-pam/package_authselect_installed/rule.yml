title: 'Install authselect Package'

description: |-
    {{{ describe_package_install(package="authselect") }}}

rationale: |-
    The <tt>authselect</tt> package provides a tool to select system authentication and
    identity sources from a list of supported profiles instead of letting the administrator
    manually build the PAM stack. Authselect is a successor to authconfig and helps avoid
    potential breakage of configuration by shipping several tested profiles that are well
    tested and supported. Ensuring the latest version of authselect is installed helps
    maintain system security by providing the latest security fixes and features.
