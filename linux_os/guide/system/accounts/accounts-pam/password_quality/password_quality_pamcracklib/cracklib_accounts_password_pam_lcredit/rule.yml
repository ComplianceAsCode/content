title: 'Set Password Strength Minimum Lowercase Characters'

description: |-
    The pam_cracklib module's <tt>lcredit=</tt> parameter controls requirements
    for usage of lowercase letters in a password. When set to a negative
    number, any password will be required to contain that many lowercase
    characters. When set to a positive number, pam_cracklib will grant +1
    additional length credit for each lowercase character.
    Add <tt>lcredit=-1</tt> after pam_cracklib.so to require use of a
    lowercase character in passwords.

rationale: |-
    Requiring a minimum number of lowercase characters makes password guessing
    attacks more difficult by ensuring a larger search space.

ocil_clause: 'lcredit is not found or not set to the required value'

ocil: |-
    Check that the operating system enforces password complexity by requiring
    that at least one lower-case character be used by using the following
    command:

    <pre># grep pam_cracklib.so /etc/pam.d/common-password
    password requisite pam_cracklib.so lcredit={{{ xccdf_value("var_password_pam_lcredit") }}}</pre>

    If the command does not return anything, the returned line is commented
    out, or has a second column value different from "requisite", or does not
    contain <tt>lcredit={{{ xccdf_value("var_password_pam_lcredit") }}}</tt>, this is a finding.

    The DoD and FISMA require at least one lowercase character in a password.
    This would appear as <tt>lcredit=-1</tt>.
