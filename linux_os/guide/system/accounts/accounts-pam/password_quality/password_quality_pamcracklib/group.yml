title: |-
    Set Password Quality Requirements, if using
    pam_cracklib

description: |-
    The <tt>pam_cracklib</tt> PAM module can be configured to meet
    requirements for a variety of policies.
    <br /><br />
    For example, to configure <tt>pam_cracklib</tt> to require at least one uppercase
    character, lowercase character, digit, and other (special)
    character, locate the following line in <tt>/etc/pam.d/system-auth</tt>:
    <pre>password requisite pam_cracklib.so try_first_pass retry=3</pre>
    and then alter it to read:
    <pre>password required pam_cracklib.so try_first_pass retry=3 maxrepeat=3 minlen=14 dcredit=-1 ucredit=-1 ocredit=-1 lcredit=-1 difok=4</pre>
    If no such line exists, add one as the first line of the password section in <tt>/etc/pam.d/system-auth</tt>.
    The arguments can be modified to ensure compliance with
    your organization's security policy. Discussion of each parameter follows.

warnings:
    - general: |-
        Note that the password quality requirements are not enforced for the
        root account for some reason.
