title: 'Set Password Strength Minimum Different Characters'

description: |-
    The pam_cracklib module's <tt>difok</tt> parameter controls requirements for
    usage of different characters during a password change. The number of
    changed characters refers to the number of changes required with respect to
    the total number of positions in the current password. In other words,
    characters may be the same within the two passwords; however, the positions
    of the like characters must be different.
    Make sure the <tt>difok</tt> parameter for the pam_cracklib module is
    configured to greater than or equal to <tt>{{{ xccdf_value("var_password_pam_difok") }}}</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Requiring a minimum number of different characters during password changes
    ensures that newly changed passwords should not resemble previously
    compromised ones. Note that passwords which are changed on compromised
    systems will still be compromised, however.

ocil: |-
    To check how many characters must differ during a password change, run the
    following command:
    <pre># grep pam_cracklib.so /etc/pam.d/common-password
    password requisite pam_cracklib.so difok={{{ xccdf_value("var_password_pam_difok") }}}</pre>
    The <tt>difok</tt> parameter will indicate how many characters must differ.
    The DoD requires at least eight characters differ during a password change.
    This would appear as <tt>difok=8</tt>.
