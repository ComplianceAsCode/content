title: 'Configure PAMs passwd Module To Implement system-auth Substack When Changing Passwords'

description: |-
    Verify that pam is configured to use <tt>/etc/pam.d/system-auth</tt>
    when changing passwords. Look for the following line in <tt>/etc/pam.d/passwd</tt>:
    <pre>password substack system-auth</pre>

rationale: |-
    Including system-auth from the passwd module ensures that the user must pass through
    the PAM configuration for system authentication as found in /etc/pam.d/system-auth
    when changing passwords.

ocil: |-
    To verify that PAM implements <tt>system-auth</tt> when changing passwords
    run the following command:
    <pre># cat /etc/pam.d/passwd | grep -i substack | grep -i system-auth
    password substack system-auth</pre>
