    {{{ full_name }}} must enforce password complexity by requiring that at least one special character be used.

    Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.

    Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.

    {{{ full_name }}} utilizes "pwquality" as a mechanism to enforce password complexity. Note that to require special characters without degrading the "minlen" value, the credit value must be expressed as a negative number in "/etc/security/pwquality.conf".

checktext: |-
    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} enforces password complexity by requiring that at least one special character with the following command:

    $ sudo grep ocredit /etc/security/pwquality.conf /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf

    ocredit = -1

    If the value of "ocredit" is a positive number or is commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to enforce password complexity by requiring that at least one special character be used by setting the "ocredit" option.

    Add the following line to "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" (or modify the line to have the required value):

    ocredit = -1
