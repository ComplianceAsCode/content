    {{{ full_name }}} must require the maximum number of repeating characters be limited to three when passwords are changed.

    Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password.
    Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting
    attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.

    Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The
    more complex a password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the
    password is compromised.

    Verify the value of the "maxrepeat" option in "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" with the following command:

    $ grep maxrepeat /etc/security/pwquality.conf

    maxrepeat = 3

    If the value of "maxrepeat" is set to more than "3" or is commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to require the change of the number of repeating consecutive characters when passwords are changed by setting the "maxrepeat" option.

    Add the following line to "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" (or modify the line to have the required value):

    maxrepeat = 3
