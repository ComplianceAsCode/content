    {{{ full_name }}} must ensure the password complexity module in the system-auth file is configured for three retries or less.

    Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks. "pwquality" enforces complex password construction configuration and has the ability to limit brute-force attacks on the system.

    {{{ full_name }}} uses "pwquality" as a mechanism to enforce password complexity. This is set in both:
    /etc/pam.d/password-auth
    /etc/pam.d/system-auth

    By limiting the number of attempts to meet the pwquality module complexity requirements before returning with an error, the system will audit abnormal attempts at password changes.

checktext: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} is configured to limit the "pwquality" retry option to 3.

    Check for the use of the "pwquality" retry option in the system-auth file with the following command:

    $ cat /etc/pam.d/system-auth | grep pam_pwquality

    password required pam_pwquality.so retry=3

    If the value of "retry" is set to "0" or greater than "3", or is missing, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to limit the "pwquality" retry option to 3.

    Add the following line to the "/etc/pam.d/system-auth" file (or modify the line to have the required value):

    password required pam_pwquality.so retry=3
