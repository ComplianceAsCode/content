    {{{ full_name }}} must require the change of at least 8 characters when passwords are changed.

    Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources
    required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength,
    is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts
    at guessing and bruteâ€“force attacks.

    Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long
    it takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the
    greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested
    before the password is compromised.

    Requiring a minimum number of different characters during password changes ensures that
    newly changed passwords should not resemble previously compromised ones.
    Note that passwords which are changed on compromised systems will still be compromised, however.

    Verify the value of the "difok" option in "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" with the following command:

    $ sudo grep difok /etc/security/pwquality.conf

    difok = 8

    If the value of "difok" is set to less than "8", or is commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to require the change of at least 8 of the total number of characters when passwords are changed by setting the "difok" option.

    Add the following line to "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" (or modify the line to have the required value):

    difok = 8
