title: 'Verify pam_pwquality module is activated'

description: |-
    The <tt>pam_pwquality.so</tt> module ensures password quality by evaluating user-created passwords 
    against a system dictionary and a set of rules designed to detect weak choices. Originally derived 
    from the pam_cracklib module, this module is backward-compatible with options of pam_cracklib.
    <br /><br />
    The module's process includes prompting the user for a password, checking its strength, and if it 
    meets the criteria requesting the password again for confirmation. If both entries match, the 
    password is passed to subsequent modules to be set as the new authentication token.

rationale: |-
    Strong passwords significantly increase the time and effort required for unauthorized access, 
    increasing overall system security.
