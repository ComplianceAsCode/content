    {{{ full_name }}} must enforce password complexity by requiring that at least one upper-case character be used.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required
    to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of
    the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force
    attacks.

    Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes
    to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of
    possble combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.
    Requiring a minimum number of lowercase characters makes password guessing attacks
    more difficult by ensuring a larger search space.

    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} enforces password complexity by requiring that at least one upper-case character.

    Check the value for "ucredit" with the following command:

    $ sudo grep ucredit /etc/security/pwquality.conf /etc/security/pwquality.conf/*.conf

    ucredit = -1

    If the value of "ucredit" is a positive number or is commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to enforce password complexity by requiring that at least one upper-case character be used by setting the "ucredit" option.

    Add the following line to /etc/security/pwquality.conf (or modify the line to have the required value):

    ucredit = -1
