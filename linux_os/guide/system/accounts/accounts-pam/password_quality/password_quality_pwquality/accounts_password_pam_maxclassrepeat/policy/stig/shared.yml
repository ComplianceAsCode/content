    Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password.
    Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting
    attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.

    Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The
    more complex a password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the
    password is compromised.

    Verify the value of the "maxclassrepeat" option in "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" with the following command:

    $ grep maxclassrepeat /etc/security/pwquality.conf

    maxclassrepeat = 4

    If the value of "maxclassrepeat" is set to "0", more than "4" or is commented out, then this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to require the change of the number of repeating characters of the same character class when passwords are changed by setting the "maxclassrepeat" option.

    Add the following line to "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" conf (or modify the line to have the required value):

    maxclassrepeat = 4
