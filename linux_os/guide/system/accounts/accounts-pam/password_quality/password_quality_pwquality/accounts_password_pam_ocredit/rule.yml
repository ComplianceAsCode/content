title: 'Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Minimum Special Characters'

description: |-
    The pam_pwquality module's <tt>ocredit=</tt> parameter controls requirements for
    usage of special (or "other") characters in a password. When set to a negative number,
    any password will be required to contain that many special characters.
    When set to a positive number, pam_pwquality will grant +1
    additional length credit for each special character. Modify the <tt>ocredit</tt> setting
    in <tt>/etc/security/pwquality.conf</tt> to equal <sub idref="var_password_pam_ocredit" />
    to require use of a special character in passwords.

rationale: |-
    Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required
    to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of
    the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force
    attacks.
    <br /><br />
    Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes
    to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of
    possble combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.
    Requiring a minimum number of special characters makes password guessing attacks
    more difficult by ensuring a larger search space.

ocil_clause: 'ocredit is not found or not equal to or less than the required value'

ocil: |-
    To check how many special characters are required in a password, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep ocredit /etc/security/pwquality.conf</pre>
    The <tt>ocredit</tt> parameter (as a negative number) will indicate how many special characters are required.
    The DoD and FISMA require at least one special character in a password.
    This would appear as <tt>ocredit = -1</tt>.
