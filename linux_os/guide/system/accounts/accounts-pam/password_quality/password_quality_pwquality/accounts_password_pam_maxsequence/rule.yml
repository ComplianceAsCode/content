title: 'Limit the maximum number of sequential characters in passwords'

description: |-
    The <tt>pwquality maxsequence</tt> setting defines the maximum allowable length for consecutive 
    character sequences in a new password. Such sequences can be, e.g., 123 or abc. If the value is 
    set to 0, this check will be turned off.
    <br /><br />
    Note: Passwords that consist mainly of such sequences are unlikely to meet the simplicity criteria 
    unless the sequence constitutes only a small portion of the overall password.

rationale: |-
    Use of a strong password helps to increase the time and resources required to
    compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the
    effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.
    <br /><br />
    Password complexity is one important factor that determines the duration required to crack it.
    A more intricate password results in a larger number of potential combinations that must be 
    tested before successfully compromising the password.
