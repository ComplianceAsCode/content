title: 'Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Minimum Digit Characters'

description: |-
    The pam_pwquality module's <tt>dcredit</tt> parameter controls requirements for
    usage of digits in a password. When set to a negative number, any password will be required to
    contain that many digits. When set to a positive number, pam_pwquality will grant +1 additional
    length credit for each digit. Modify the <tt>dcredit</tt> setting in
    <tt>{{{ pwquality_path }}}</tt> to require the use of a digit in passwords.

rationale: |-
    Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required
    to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of
    the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force
    attacks.
    <br /><br />
    Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes
    to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of
    possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.
    Requiring digits makes password guessing attacks more difficult by ensuring a larger
    search space.

ocil: |-
    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} enforces password complexity by requiring that at least one numeric character be used.

    Check the value for "dcredit" with the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo grep dcredit {{{ pwquality_path }}} /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf

    {{{ pwquality_path }}}:dcredit = {{{ xccdf_value('var_password_pam_dcredit') }}}</pre>

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to enforce password complexity by requiring that at least one numeric character be used by setting the "dcredit" option.

    Add the following line to "{{{ pwquality_path }}}" (or modify the line to have the required value):

    dcredit = {{{ xccdf_value('var_password_pam_dcredit') }}}

srg_requirement: '{{{ full_name }}} must enforce password complexity by requiring that at least one numeric character be used.'
