srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must ensure the password complexity module is enabled in the system-auth file.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Enabling PAM password complexity permits enforcement of strong passwords and consequently makes the system less prone to dictionary attacks.

checktext: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} uses "pwquality" to enforce the password complexity rules in the system-auth file with the following command:

    $ grep pam_pwquality /etc/pam.d/system-auth

    password required pam_pwquality.so

    If the command does not return a line containing the value "pam_pwquality.so", or the line is commented out, this is a finding.

    If the system administrator (SA) can demonstrate that the required configuration is contained in a PAM configuration file included or substacked from the system-auth file, this is not a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to use "pwquality" to enforce password complexity rules.

    Add the following line to the "/etc/pam.d/system-auth" file(or modify the line to have the required value):

    password required pam_pwquality.so
