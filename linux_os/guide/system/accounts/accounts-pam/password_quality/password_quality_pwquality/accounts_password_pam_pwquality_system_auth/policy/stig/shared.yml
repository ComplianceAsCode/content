srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must ensure the password complexity module is enabled in the system-auth file.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Enabling PAM password complexity permits to enforce strong passwords and consequently
    makes the system less prone to dictionary attacks.

checktext: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} uses "pwquality" to enforce the password complexity rules in the system-auth file with the following command:

    $ cat /etc/pam.d/system-auth | grep pam_pwquality

    password required pam_pwquality.so

    If the command does not return a line containing the value "pam_pwquality.so", or the line is commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to use "pwquality" to enforce password complexity rules.

    Add the following line to the "/etc/pam.d/system-auth" file(or modify the line to have the required value):

    password required pam_pwquality.so
