    {{{ full_name }}} must ensure the password complexity module is enabled in the password-auth file.

    Enabling PAM password complexity permits to enforce strong passwords and consequently
    makes the system less prone to dictionary attacks.

    To check if pam_pwhistory.so is enabled in password-auth, run the following command:
     $ grep pam_pwquality /etc/pam.d/password-auth
    The output should be similar to the following:
     password requisite pam_pwquality.so

    If pam_pwquality.so is not enabled in password-auth, then this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to use "pwquality" to enforce password complexity rules.

    Add the following line to the "/etc/pam.d/password-auth" file (or modify the line to have the required value):

    password required pam_pwquality.so
