title: 'Set Password Strength Minimum Different Categories'

description: |-
    The pam_pwquality module's <tt>minclass</tt> parameter controls
    requirements for usage of different character classes, or types, of character
    that must exist in a password before it is considered valid. For example,
    setting this value to three (3) requires that any password must have characters
    from at least three different categories in order to be approved. The default
    value is zero (0), meaning there are no required classes. There are four
    categories available:
    <pre>
    * Upper-case characters
    * Lower-case characters
    * Digits
    * Special characters (for example, punctuation)
    </pre>
    Modify the <tt>minclass</tt> setting in <tt>/etc/security/pwquality.conf</tt> entry
    to require <sub idref="var_password_pam_minclass" />
    differing categories of characters when changing passwords.

rationale: |-
    Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password.
    Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts
    at guessing and brute-force attacks.
    <br /><br />
    Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The
    more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before
    the password is compromised.
    <br /><br />
    Requiring a minimum number of character categories makes password guessing attacks more difficult
    by ensuring a larger search space.

ocil_clause: 'minclass is not found or not set equal to or greater than the required value'

ocil: |-
    To check how many categories of characters must be used in password during a password change,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep minclass /etc/security/pwquality.conf</pre>
    The <tt>minclass</tt> parameter will indicate how many character classes must be used. If
    the requirement was for the password to contain characters from three different categories,
    then this would appear as <tt>minclass = 3</tt>.
