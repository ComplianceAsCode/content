title: 'Set Password Strength Minimum Lowercase Characters'

description: |-
    The pam_pwquality module's <tt>lcredit</tt> parameter controls requirements for
    usage of lowercase letters in a password. When set to a negative number, any password will be required to
    contain that many lowercase characters. When set to a positive number, pam_pwquality will grant +1 additional
    length credit for each lowercase character. Modify the <tt>lcredit</tt> setting in
    <tt>/etc/security/pwquality.conf</tt> to require the use of a lowercase character in passwords.

rationale: |-
    Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required
    to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of
    the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force
    attacks.
    <br /><br />
    Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes
    to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of
    possble combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.
    Requiring a minimum number of lowercase characters makes password guessing attacks
    more difficult by ensuring a larger search space.

ocil: |-
    To check how many lowercase characters are required in a password, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep lcredit /etc/security/pwquality.conf</pre>
    The <tt>lcredit</tt> parameter (as a negative number) will indicate how many special characters are required.
    The DoD and FISMA require at least one lowercase character in a password. This would appear as <tt>lcredit = -1</tt>.
