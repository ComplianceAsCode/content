title: 'Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Minimum Lowercase Characters'

description: |-
    The pam_pwquality module's <tt>lcredit</tt> parameter controls requirements for
    usage of lowercase letters in a password. When set to a negative number, any password will be required to
    contain that many lowercase characters. When set to a positive number, pam_pwquality will grant +1 additional
    length credit for each lowercase character. Modify the <tt>lcredit</tt> setting in
    <tt>{{{ pwquality_path }}}</tt> to require the use of a lowercase character in passwords.

rationale: |-
    Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required
    to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of
    the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force
    attacks.
    <br />
    Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes
    to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of
    possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.
    Requiring a minimum number of lowercase characters makes password guessing attacks
    more difficult by ensuring a larger search space.

ocil_clause: 'the value of "lcredit" is a positive number or is commented out'

ocil: |-
    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} enforces password complexity by requiring that at least one lower-case character.

    Check the value for "lcredit" with the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo grep lcredit {{{ pwquality_path }}} /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf

    {{{ pwquality_path }}}:lcredit = -1</pre>

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to enforce password complexity by requiring that at least one lower-case character be used by setting the "lcredit" option.

    Add the following line to "{{{ pwquality_path }}}" (or modify the line to have the required value):

    lcredit = {{{ xccdf_value('var_password_pam_lcredit') }}}

srg_requirement: '{{{ full_name }}} must enforce password complexity by requiring that at least one lower-case character be used.'
