title: 'Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Enforce for root User'

description: |-
    The pam_pwquality module's <tt>enforce_for_root</tt> parameter controls requirements for
    enforcing password complexity for the root user. Enable the <tt>enforce_for_root</tt>
    setting in <tt>/etc/security/pwquality.conf</tt> to require the <tt>root</tt> user
    to use complex passwords.

rationale: |-
    Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise
    the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a
    password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.
    
    Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a
    password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations
    that need to be tested before the password is compromised.

ocil: |-
    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} enforces password complexity rules for the root account.

    Check if root user is required to use complex passwords with the following command:

    <pre>$ grep enforce_for_root /etc/security/pwquality.conf /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf

    /etc/security/pwquality.conf:enforce_for_root</pre>

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to enforce password complexity on the root account.

    Add or update the following line in /etc/security/pwquality.conf:

    enforce_for_root

srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must enforce password complexity rules for the root account.
