    {{{ full_name }}} must ensure the password complexity module in the system-auth file is configured for three retries or less.

    Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required
    to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure
    of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and
    brute-force attacks. "pwquality" enforces complex password construction
    configuration and has the ability to limit brute-force attacks on the
    system.

    {{{ full_name }}} uses "pwquality" as a mechanism to enforce password
    complexity. This is set in both:

    <tt>/etc/pam.d/password-auth</tt>
    <tt>/etc/pam.d/system-auth</tt>

    By limiting the number of attempts to meet the pwquality module complexity
    requirements before returning with an error, the system will audit abnormal
    attempts at password changes.

checktext: |-
    Verify {{{ full_name }}} is configured to limit the "pwquality" retry option to "3".

    Check for the use of the retry option in the security directory with the following command:

    <pre>$ grep -w retry /etc/security/pwquality.conf /etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf</pre>

    <pre>retry = 3</pre>

    If the value of "retry" is set to "0" or greater than "3", or is missing,
    this is a finding.


fixtext: |-
    Add or update the following line in the "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" file
    or a file in the "/etc/security/pwquality.conf.d/" directory to contain the
    "retry" parameter:

    <pre>retry = 3</pre>
