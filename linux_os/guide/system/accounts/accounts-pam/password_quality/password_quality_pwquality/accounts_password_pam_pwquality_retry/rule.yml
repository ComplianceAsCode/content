title: 'Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Authentication Retry Prompts Permitted Per-Session in /etc/security/pwquality.conf'

description: |-
    To configure the number of retry prompts that are permitted per-session:
    Edit the <tt>/etc/security/pwquality.conf</tt> to include
    <tt>retry={{{xccdf_value("var_password_pam_retry") }}}</tt>, or a lower value if site
    policy is more restrictive. The DoD requirement is a maximum of 3 prompts
    per session.

rationale: |-
    Setting the password retry prompts that are permitted on a per-session basis to a low value
    requires some software, such as SSH, to re-connect. This can slow down and
    draw additional attention to some types of password-guessing attacks. Note that this
    is different from account lockout, which is provided by the pam_faillock module.
