title: 'Set Password Strength Minimum Different Characters'

description: |-
    The pam_pwquality module's <tt>difok</tt> parameter sets the number of characters
    in a password that must not be present in and old password during a password change.
    <br /><br />
    Modify the <tt>difok</tt> setting in <tt>/etc/security/pwquality.conf</tt>
    to equal <sub idref="var_password_pam_difok" /> to require differing characters
    when changing passwords.

rationale: |-
    Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources
    required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength,
    is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts
    at guessing and bruteâ€“force attacks.
    <br /><br />
    Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long
    it takes to crack a password. The more complex the password, the
    greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested
    before the password is compromised.
    <br /><br />
    Requiring a minimum number of different characters during password changes ensures that
    newly changed passwords should not resemble previously compromised ones.
    Note that passwords which are changed on compromised systems will still be compromised, however.

ocil: |-
    To check how many characters must differ during a password change, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep difok /etc/security/pwquality.conf</pre>
    The <tt>difok</tt> parameter will indicate how many characters must differ.
