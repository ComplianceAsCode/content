title: 'Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Enforcing'

description: |-
    Verify that the operating system uses "pwquality" to enforce the
    password complexity rules.
    
    Verify the pwquality module is being enforced by operating system by
    running the following command:
    <pre>
    $ grep -i enforcing /etc/security/pwquality.conf
    enforcing = 1
    </pre>

    If the value of "enforcing" is not "1" or the line is commented out,
    this is a finding.

rationale: |-
    Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources
    required to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength,
    is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at
    guessing and brute-force attacks. Using enforcing=1 ensures "pwquality"
    enforces complex password construction configuration and has the ability
    to limit brute-force attacks on the system.

ocil: |-
    To verify that enforcing is correctly applied, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep -i enforcing /etc/security/pwquality.conf</pre>
    The output should return <tt>enforcing = 1</tt> uncommented.
