title: 'Set Password Minimum Length'

description: |-
    The pam_pwquality module's <tt>minlen</tt> parameter controls requirements for
    minimum characters required in a password. Add <tt>minlen=<sub idref="var_password_pam_minlen" /></tt>
    after pam_pwquality to set minimum password length requirements.

rationale: |-
    The shorter the password, the lower the number of possible combinations
    that need to be tested before the password is compromised.
    <br />
    Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a
    password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force attacks.
    Password length is one factor of several that helps to determine strength
    and how long it takes to crack a password. Use of more characters in a password
    helps to exponentially increase the time and/or resources required to
    compromose the password.

    To check how many characters are required in a password, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep minlen /etc/security/pwquality.conf</pre>
    Your output should contain <tt>minlen = <sub idref="var_password_pam_minlen" /></tt>
