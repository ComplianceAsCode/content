title: 'Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Prevent the Use of Dictionary Words'

description: |-
    The pam_pwquality module's <tt>dictcheck</tt> check if passwords contains dictionary words. When
    <tt>dictcheck</tt> is set to <tt>1</tt> passwords will be checked for dictionary words.

rationale: |-
    Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password.
    Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at
    guessing and brute-force attacks.
    <br /><br />
    Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more
    complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the
    password is compromised.
    <br /><br />
    Passwords with dictionary words may be more vulnerable to password-guessing attacks.

    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to prevent the use of dictionary words for passwords.

    Add or update the following line in the "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" file or a configuration file in the /etc/pwquality.conf.d/ directory to contain the "dictcheck" parameter:

    dictcheck=1
