title: 'Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Prevent the Use of Dictionary Words'

description: |-
    The pam_pwquality module's <tt>dictcheck</tt> check if passwords contains dictionary words. When
    <tt>dictcheck</tt> is set to <tt>1</tt> passwords will be checked for dictionary words.

rationale: |-
    Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password.
    Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at
    guessing and brute-force attacks.
    <br /><br />
    Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more
    complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the
    password is compromised.
    <br /><br />
    Passwords with dictionary words may be more vulnerable to password-guessing attacks.

ocil_clause: 'dictcheck is not found or not equal to the required value'

ocil: |-
    To check if dictionary words are disallowed run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep dictcheck /etc/security/pwquality.conf /etc/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf</pre>
    The <tt>dictcheck</tt> parameter should be equal to 1. The value should look like
    <pre>dictcheck=1</pre>
