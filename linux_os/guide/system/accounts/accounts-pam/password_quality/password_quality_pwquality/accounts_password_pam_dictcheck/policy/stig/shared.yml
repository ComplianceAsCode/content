    {{{ full_name }}} Must Prevent The Use Of Dictionary Words For Passwords.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password.
    Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at
    guessing and brute-force attacks.

    If {{{ full_name }}} allows the user to select passwords based on dictionary words, this increases the chances of password compromise by increasing the opportunity for successful guesses, and brute-force attacks.

    Verify {{{ full_name }}} prevents the use of dictionary words for passwords with the following command:

    $ sudo grep dictcheck /etc/security/pwquality.conf /etc/pwquality.conf.d/*.conf

    /etc/security/pwquality.conf:dictcheck=1

    If "dictcheck" does not have a value other than "0", or is commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to prevent the use of dictionary words for passwords.

    Add or update the following line in the "/etc/security/pwquality.conf" file or a configuration file in the /etc/pwquality.conf.d/ directory to contain the "dictcheck" parameter:

    dictcheck=1
