title: 'Set Password Maximum Consecutive Repeating Characters'

description: |-
    The pam_pwquality module's <tt>maxrepeat</tt> parameter controls requirements for
    consecutive repeating characters. When set to a positive number, it will reject passwords
    which contain more than that number of consecutive characters. Modify the <tt>maxrepeat</tt> setting
    in <tt>/etc/security/pwquality.conf</tt> to equal <sub idref="var_password_pam_maxrepeat" /> to prevent a
    run of (<sub idref="var_password_pam_maxrepeat" /> + 1) or more identical characters.

rationale: |-
    Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required to compromise the password.
    Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at
    guessing and brute-force attacks.
    <br /><br />
    Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes to crack a password. The more
    complex the password, the greater the number of possible combinations that need to be tested before the
    password is compromised.
    <br /><br />
    Passwords with excessive repeating characters may be more vulnerable to password-guessing attacks.

ocil_clause: 'maxrepeat is not found or not greater than or equal to the required value'

ocil: |-
    To check the maximum value for consecutive repeating characters, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep maxrepeat /etc/security/pwquality.conf</pre>
    Look for the value of the <tt>maxrepeat</tt> parameter. The DoD requirement is 3, which would appear as
    <tt>maxrepeat=3</tt>.
