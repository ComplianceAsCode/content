title: "Set PAM's Common Authentication Hashing Algorithm"

description: |-
    The PAM system service can be configured to only store encrypted
    representations of passwords. In
    <tt>/etc/pam.d/common-auth</tt>,
    the
    <tt>auth</tt> section of the file controls which PAM modules execute
    during a password change. Set the <tt>pam_unix.so</tt> module in the
    <tt>auth</tt> section to include the argument <tt>sha512</tt>, as shown
    below:
    <br />
    <pre>auth   required    pam_unix.so sha512 <i>other arguments...</i></pre>
    <br />
    This will help ensure when local users change their authentication method,
    hashes for the new authentications will be generated using the SHA-512
    algorithm. This is the default.

rationale: |-
    Unapproved mechanisms used for authentication to the cryptographic module
    are not verified and therefore cannot be relied on to provide
    confidentiality or integrity, and data may be compromised.
    This setting ensures user and group account administration utilities are
    configured to store only encrypted representations of passwords.
    Additionally, the <tt>crypt_style</tt> configuration option ensures the use
    of a strong hashing algorithm that makes password cracking attacks more
    difficult.
