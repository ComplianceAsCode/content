title: "Set PAM's Password Hashing Algorithm for Logins"

description: |-
    The PAM system service can be configured to only store encrypted
    representations of passwords. In <tt>/etc/pam.d/common-auth</tt>, the
    <tt>password</tt> section of the file controls which PAM modules execute
    during a password change. Set the <tt>pam_unix.so</tt> module in the
    <tt>password</tt> section to include the argument <tt>sha512</tt>, as shown
    below:
    <br />
    <pre>auth    required    pam_unix.so sha512 <i>other arguments...</i></pre>
    <br />
    This will help ensure when local users change their passwords, hashes for
    the new passwords will be generated using the SHA-512 algorithm. This is
    the default.

rationale: |-
    Passwords need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard
    method for protecting passwords. If passwords are not encrypted, they can
    be plainly read (i.e., clear text) and easily compromised. Passwords that
    are encrypted with a weak algorithm are no more protected than if they are
    kepy in plain text.
    <br /><br />
    This setting ensures user and group account administration utilities are
    configured to store only encrypted representations of passwords.
    Additionally, the <tt>crypt_style</tt> configuration option ensures the use
    of a strong hashing algorithm that makes password cracking attacks more
    difficult.

    Inspect the contents of <tt>/etc/pam.d/common-auth</tt>
    and ensure that the <tt>pam_unix.so</tt> module includes the argument
    <tt>sha512</tt>:
    <pre>$ grep sha512 /etc/pam.d/common-auth
    auth required pam_unix.so sha512 try_first_pass</pre>
