title: 'Set Password Hashing Rounds in /etc/login.defs'

description: |-
    In <tt>/etc/login.defs</tt>, remove or correct the following lines to ensure
    the system will use a sufficient number of hashing rounds to store passwords:
    <pre>SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS 5000
    SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS 5000</pre>

rationale: |-
    Passwords need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard method for protecting passwords.
    If passwords are not encrypted, they can be plainly read (i.e., clear text) and easily compromised. Passwords
    that are encrypted with a weak algorithm are no more protected than if they are kept in plain text.
    <br /><br />
    Using more hashing rounds makes password cracking attacks more difficult.

ocil: |-
    Inspect <tt>/etc/login.defs</tt> and ensure the following settings are either not configured, or set at least to a value of 5000:
    <pre>SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS 5000
    SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS 5000</pre>
