srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} shadow password suite must be configured to use a sufficient number of hashing rounds.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Passwords need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard
    method for protecting passwords. If passwords are not encrypted, they can
    be plainly read (i.e., clear text) and easily compromised. Passwords
    that are encrypted with a weak algorithm are no more protected than if
    they are kept in plain text.



    Using more hashing rounds makes password cracking attacks more difficult.

checktext: |-
    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} has a minimum number of hash rounds configured with the following command:

    $ grep -i sha_crypt /etc/login.defs

    If "SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS" or "SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS" is less than "5000", this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to encrypt all stored passwords with a strong cryptographic hash.

    Edit/modify the following line in the "/etc/login.defs" file and set "SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS" to a value no lower than "5000":

    SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS 5000
