srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} must be configured so that user and group account administration utilities are configured to store only encrypted representations of passwords.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Passwords need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard
    method for protecting passwords. If passwords are not encrypted, they can
    be plainly read (i.e., clear text) and easily compromised. Passwords that
    are encrypted with a weak algorithm are no more protected than if they are
    kepy in plain text.



    This setting ensures user and group account administration utilities are
    configured to store only encrypted representations of passwords.
    Additionally, the "crypt_style" configuration option ensures the use
    of a strong hashing algorithm that makes password cracking attacks more
    difficult.

checktext: |-
    Verify the user and group account administration utilities are configured to store only encrypted representations of passwords with the following command:

    # grep crypt /etc/libuser.conf

    crypt_style = sha512

    If the "crypt_style" variable is not set to "sha512", is not in the defaults section, is commented out, or does not exist, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to use the SHA-512 algorithm for password hashing.

    Add or change the following line in the "[default]" section of "/etc/libuser.conf" file:

    crypt_style = sha512
