title: 'Set Password Hashing Algorithm in /etc/libuser.conf'

description: |-
    In <tt>/etc/libuser.conf</tt>, add or correct the following line in its
    <tt>[defaults]</tt> section to ensure the system will use the SHA-512
    algorithm for password hashing:
    <pre>crypt_style = sha512</pre>

rationale: |-
    Passwords need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard
    method for protecting passwords. If passwords are not encrypted, they can
    be plainly read (i.e., clear text) and easily compromised. Passwords that
    are encrypted with a weak algorithm are no more protected than if they are
    kepy in plain text.
    <br /><br />
    This setting ensures user and group account administration utilities are
    configured to store only encrypted representations of passwords.
    Additionally, the <tt>crypt_style</tt> configuration option ensures the use
    of a strong hashing algorithm that makes password cracking attacks more
    difficult.
