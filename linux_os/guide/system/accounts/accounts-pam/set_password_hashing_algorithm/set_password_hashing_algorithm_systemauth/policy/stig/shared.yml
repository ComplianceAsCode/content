    {{{ full_name }}} pam_unix.so module must be configured in the password-auth file to use a FIPS 140-3 approved cryptographic hashing algorithm for system authentication.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Unapproved mechanisms that are used for authentication to the cryptographic module are not verified and therefore cannot be relied upon to provide confidentiality or integrity, and DoD data may be compromised.

    {{{ full_name }}} systems utilizing encryption are required to use FIPS-compliant mechanisms for authenticating to cryptographic modules.

    FIPS 140-3 is the current standard for validating that mechanisms used to access cryptographic modules utilize authentication that meets DoD requirements. This allows for Security Levels 1, 2, 3, or 4 for use on a general-purpose computing system.

checktext: |-
    Verify that the pam_unix.so module is configured to use sha512 in /etc/pam.d/password-auth with the following command:

    $ grep "^password.*pam_unix.so.*sha512" /etc/pam.d/password-auth

    password sufficient pam_unix.so sha512

    If "sha512" is missing, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to use a FIPS 140-3 approved cryptographic hashing algorithm for system authentication.

    Edit/modify the following line in the "/etc/pam.d/password-auth" file to include the sha512 option for pam_unix.so:

    password sufficient pam_unix.so sha512
