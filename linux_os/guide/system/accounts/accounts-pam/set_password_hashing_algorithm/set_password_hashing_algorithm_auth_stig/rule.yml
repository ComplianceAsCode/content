title: "Set Password Hashing Algorithm for PAM"

{{% set pam_passwd_file_path = "/etc/pam.d/common-password" %}}

description: |-
    The PAM system service can be configured to only store encrypted representations of passwords.
    In "{{{ pam_passwd_file_path }}}", the <tt>password</tt> section of the file controls which
    PAM modules to execute during a password change.

    Set the <tt>pam_unix.so</tt> module in the <tt>password</tt> section to include the option
    <tt>sha512</tt> and no other hashing algorithms as shown below:
    <br />
    <pre>password    [success=1 default=ignore]   pam_unix.so sha512 <i>other arguments...</i></pre>
    <br />
    This will help ensure that new passwords for local users will be stored using the sha512 algorithm.

rationale: |-
    Passwords need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard method for
    protecting passwords. If passwords are not encrypted, they can be plainly read
    (i.e., clear text) and easily compromised. Passwords that are encrypted with a weak algorithm
    are no more protected than if they are kept in plain text.
    <br /><br />
    This setting ensures user and group account administration utilities are configured to store
    only encrypted representations of passwords.
