    {{{ full_name }}} must be configured to use the shadow file to store only encrypted representations of passwords.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Passwords need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard
    method for protecting passwords. If passwords are not encrypted, they can
    be plainly read (i.e., clear text) and easily compromised. Passwords that
    are encrypted with a weak algorithm are no more protected than if they are
    kepy in plain text.



    This setting ensures user and group account administration utilities are
    configured to store only encrypted representations of passwords.
    Additionally, the "crypt_style" configuration option ensures the use
    of a strong hashing algorithm that makes password cracking attacks more
    difficult.

checktext: |-
    Verify the system's shadow file is configured to store only encrypted representations of passwords. with a hash value of SHA512 with the following command:

    # grep -i encrypt_method /etc/login.defs

    ENCRYPT_METHOD SHA512

    If "ENCRYPT_METHOD" does not have a value of "SHA512", or the line is commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to store only SHA512 encrypted representations of passwords.

    Add or update the following line in the "/etc/login.defs" file:

    ENCRYPT_METHOD SHA512
