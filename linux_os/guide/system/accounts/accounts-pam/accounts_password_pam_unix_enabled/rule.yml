title: Verify pam_unix module is activated

description: |-
    <tt>pam_unix</tt> is the standard Unix authentication module. It uses standard calls from the
    system's libraries to retrieve and set account information as well as authentication.
    Usually this is obtained from the <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> and if shadow is enabled, the
    <tt>/etc/shadow</tt> file as well.
    <br /><br />
    The account component performs the task of establishing the status of the user's
    account and password based on the following shadow elements: <tt>expire,
    last_change, max_change, min_change, warn_change</tt>. In the case of the latter, it may
    offer advice to the user on changing their password or, through the
    <tt>PAM_AUTHTOKEN_REQD</tt> return, delay giving service to the user until they have
    established a new password. The entries listed above are documented in the shadow(5)
    manual page. Should the user's record not contain one or more of these entries, the
    corresponding shadow check is not performed.
    <br /><br />
    The authentication component performs the task of checking the users credentials
    (password). The default action of this module is to not permit the user access to a
    service if their official password is blank.

rationale: |-
    The system should only provide access after performing authentication of a user.
