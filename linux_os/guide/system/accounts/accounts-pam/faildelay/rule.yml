title: 'Enforce Delay After Failed Logon Attempts'

description: |-
    To configure the system to introduce a delay after failed logon attempts,
    add or correct the <tt>pam_faildelay</tt> settings in
    <tt>/etc/pam.d/common-auth</tt> to read as follows:
    <pre>auth required pam_faildelay.so delay=<sub idref="var_accounts_fail_delay" />000000</pre>

rationale: |-
    Limiting the number of logon attempts over a certain time interval reduces
    the chances that an unauthorized user may gain access to an account.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: 'that is not the case'

ocil: |-
    Verify the SUSE operating system enforces a delay of at least four seconds
    between logon prompts following a failed logon attempt.

    <pre># grep pam_faildelay /etc/pam.d/common-auth*
    auth required pam_faildelay.so delay=<sub idref="var_accounts_fail_delay" />000000</pre>

    If the value of <tt>delay</tt> is not set to <tt><sub idref="var_accounts_fail_delay" />4000000</tt>, <tt>delay</tt> is commented out, <tt>delay</tt> is missing, or the <tt>pam_faildelay</tt> line is missing completely, this is a finding.
