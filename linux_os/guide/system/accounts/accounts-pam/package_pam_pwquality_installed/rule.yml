title: 'Install pam_pwquality Package'

description: |-
    {{{ describe_package_install(package="libpam-pwquality") }}}

rationale: |-
    Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required
    to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure
    of the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and
    brute-force attacks. "pwquality" enforces complex password construction
    configuration and has the ability to limit brute-force attacks on the
    system.
