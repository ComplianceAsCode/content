title: 'Ensure PAM Displays Last Logon/Access Notification'

description: |-
    To configure the system to notify users of last logon/access using <tt>pam_lastlog</tt>,
    add or correct the <tt>pam_lastlog</tt> settings in <tt>{{{ pam_lastlog_path }}}</tt>
    to include <tt>showfailed</tt> option, such as:
    <pre>session     {{{ control }}}    pam_lastlog.so showfailed</pre>
    And make sure that the <tt>silent</tt> option is not set for this specific line.

rationale: |-
    Users need to be aware of activity that occurs regarding their account. Providing users with
    information regarding the number of unsuccessful attempts that were made to login to their
    account allows the user to determine if any unauthorized activity has occurred and gives them
    an opportunity to notify administrators.

    Verify users are provided with feedback on when account accesses last occurred with the following command:

    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to provide users with feedback on when account accesses last occurred by setting the required configuration options in "{{{ pam_lastlog_path }}}".

    Add the following line to the top of "{{{ pam_lastlog_path }}}":

warnings:
    - general: |-
       If the system relies on <tt>authselect</tt> tool to manage PAM settings, the remediation
       will also use <tt>authselect</tt> tool. However, if any manual modification was made in
       PAM files, the <tt>authselect</tt> integrity check will fail and the remediation will be
       aborted in order to preserve intentional changes. In this case, an informative message will
       be shown in the remediation report.
    - general: |-
       <tt>authselect</tt> contains an authselect feature to easily and properly enable Last Logon
       notifications with <tt>pam_lastlog.so</tt> module. If a custom profile was created and used
       in the system before this authselect feature was available, the new feature can't be used
       with this custom profile and the remediation will fail. In this case, the custom profile
       should be recreated or manually updated.
