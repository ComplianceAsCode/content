title: Disallow Configuration to Bypass Password Requirements for Privilege Escalation

description: |-
    Verify the operating system is not configured to bypass password requirements for privilege
    escalation. Check the configuration of the "/etc/pam.d/sudo" file with the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep pam_succeed_if /etc/pam.d/sudo</pre>
    If any occurrences of "pam_succeed_if" is returned from the command, this is a finding.


rationale: |-
    Without re-authentication, users may access resources or perform tasks for which they do not
    have authorization. When operating systems provide the capability to escalate a functional
    capability, it is critical the user re-authenticate.
