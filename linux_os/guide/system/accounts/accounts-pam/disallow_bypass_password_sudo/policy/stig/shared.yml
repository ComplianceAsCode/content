    Without re-authentication, users may access resources or perform tasks for which they do not
    have authorization. When operating systems provide the capability to escalate a functional
    capability, it is critical the user re-authenticate.

checktext: |-
    Verify the operating system is not configured to bypass password requirements for privilege escalation with the following command:

    $ sudo grep pam_succeed_if /etc/pam.d/sudo

    If any occurances of "pam_succeed_if" are returned, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the operating system to require users to supply a password for privilege escalation.

    Remove any occurrences of " pam_succeed_if " in the  "/etc/pam.d/sudo" file.
