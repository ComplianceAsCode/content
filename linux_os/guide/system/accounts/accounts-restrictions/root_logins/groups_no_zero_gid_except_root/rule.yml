title: 'Verify Only Group Root Has GID 0'

description: |-
    If any group other than root has a GID of 0, this misconfiguration should
    be investigated and the groups other than root should be removed or have
    their GID changed.

rationale: |-
    Ensuring that only the <tt>root</tt> group has a GID of 0 helps prevent
    root group owned files from becoming accidentally accessible to
    non-privileged users.

severity: high

ocil_clause: 'any groups other than "root" have a GID of "0"'

ocil: |-
    Verify that only the "root" group has a GID "0" assignment with the
    following command:
    <pre>$ awk -F: '$3 == 0 {print $1}' /etc/group</pre>
    <pre>root</pre>

fixtext: |-
    Change the GID of any group on the system, other than root, that has a GID of "0".

warnings:
  - general: |-
       This rule doesn't come with a remediation. The removal of groups from a system
       or reassigning the GID is considered too disruptive.
