title: 'Ensure the Group Used by pam_wheel Module Exists on System and is Empty'

description: |-
    Ensure that the group {{{ xccdf_value("var_pam_wheel_group_for_su") }}}
    referenced by the pam_wheel  <tt>group</tt> parameter exists and has no
    members. This ensures that no user can run commands with altered
    privileges through the <tt>su</tt> command.

rationale: |-
    The <tt>su</tt> program allows to run commands with a substitute user and
    group ID. It is commonly used to run commands as the root user. Limiting
    access to such command is considered a good security practice.
