title: 'Restrict Web Browser Use for Administrative Accounts'

description: |-
    Enforce policy requiring administrative accounts use web browsers only for
    local service administration.

rationale: |-
    If a browser vulnerability is exploited while running with administrative privileges,
    the entire system could be compromised. Specific exceptions for local service
    administration should be documented in site-defined policy.

    Check the <tt>root</tt> home directory for a <tt>.mozilla</tt> directory. If
    one exists, ensure browsing is limited to local service administration.
