title: 'Ensure root account access is controlled'

description: |-
    There are a number of methods to access the root account directly. 
    Without a password set any user would be able to gain access and 
    thus control over the entire system.

rationale: |-
    Access to root should be secured at all times.

severity: medium

platform: system_with_kernel

ocil_clause: 'root password is not set or is not locked'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command to verify that either the root user's
    password is set or the root user's account is locked:
    <pre># passwd -S root | awk '$2 ~ /^(P|L)/ {print "User: \"" $1 "\" Password is status: " $2}'</pre>
    Verify the output is either: 
    User: "root" Password is status: P
    - OR -
    User: "root" Password is status: L
    Note:
    - P - Password is set
    - L - Password is locked
    

warnings:
  - general: This rule doesn't come with a remediation, as the exact requirement allows root to either have a password or be locked.
