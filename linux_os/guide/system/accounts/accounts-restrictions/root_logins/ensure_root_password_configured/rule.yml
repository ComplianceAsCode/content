title: 'Ensure Authentication Required for Single User Mode'

description: |-
    Single user mode is used for recovery when the system detects an
    issue during boot or by manual selection from the bootloader.

rationale: |-
    Requiring authentication in single user mode prevents an unauthorized
    user from rebooting the system into single user to gain root privileges
    without credentials.
