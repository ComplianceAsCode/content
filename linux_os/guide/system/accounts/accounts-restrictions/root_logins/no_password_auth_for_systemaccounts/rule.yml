title: 'Ensure that System Accounts Are Locked'

description: |-
    Some accounts are not associated with a human user of the system, and exist to perform some
    administrative functions. An attacker should not be able to log into these accounts.
    <br/><br/>
    System accounts are those user accounts with a user ID less than <tt>{{{ uid_min }}}</tt>.
    If any system account other than <tt>root</tt>, <tt>halt</tt>, <tt>sync</tt>, <tt>shutdown</tt>
    and <tt>nfsnobody</tt> has an unlocked password, disable it with the command:
    <pre>$ sudo usermod -L <i>account</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    Disabling authentication for default system accounts makes it more difficult for attackers
    to make use of them to compromise a system.

    To obtain a list of all users and the content of their shadow password field, run the command:
    <pre>$ sudo readarray -t systemaccounts < <(awk -F: \
        '($3 < {{{ uid_min }}} && $3 != root && $3 != halt && $3 != sync && $3 != shutdown \
        && $3 != nfsnobody) { print $1 }' /etc/passwd)

        for account in "${systemaccounts[@]}"; do
            awk -v user="$account" -F: '$1~account { print $1 ":" $2 }' /etc/shadow
        done</pre>
    Verify if all accounts are locked.
