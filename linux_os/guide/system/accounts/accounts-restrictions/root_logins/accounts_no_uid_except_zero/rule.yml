title: 'Verify Only Root Has UID 0'

description: |-
    If any account other than root has a UID of 0, this misconfiguration should
    be investigated and the accounts other than root should be removed or have
    their UID changed.
    <br />
    If the account is associated with system commands or applications the UID
    should be changed to one greater than "0" but less than "1000."
    Otherwise assign a UID greater than "1000" that has not already been
    assigned.

rationale: |-
    An account has root authority if it has a UID of 0. Multiple accounts
    with a UID of 0 afford more opportunity for potential intruders to
    guess a password for a privileged account. Proper configuration of
    sudo is recommended to afford multiple system administrators
    access to root privileges in an accountable manner.

ocil: |-
    Verify that only the "root" account has a UID "0" assignment with the
    following command:
    <pre>$ awk -F: '$3 == 0 {print $1}' /etc/passwd</pre>
    <pre>root</pre>

fixtext: |-
    Change the UID of any account on the system, other than root, that has a UID of "0".
    If the account is associated with system commands or applications, the UID
    should be changed to one greater than "0" but less than "1000". Otherwise,
    assign a UID of greater than "1000" that has not already been assigned.

srg_requirement: 'The root account must be the only account having unrestricted access to the {{{ full_name }}} system.'
