title: 'Verify Only Root Has UID 0'

description: |-
    If any account other than root has a UID of 0, this misconfiguration should
    be investigated and the accounts other than root should be removed or have
    their UID changed.
    <br />
    If the account is associated with system commands or applications the UID
    should be changed to one greater than "0" but less than "1000."
    Otherwise assign a UID greater than "1000" that has not already been
    assigned.

rationale: |-
    An account has root authority if it has a UID of 0. Multiple accounts
    with a UID of 0 afford more opportunity for potential intruders to
    guess a password for a privileged account. Proper configuration of
    sudo is recommended to afford multiple system administrators
    access to root privileges in an accountable manner.

ocil_clause: 'any account other than root has a UID of 0'

ocil: |-
    To list all password file entries for accounts with UID 0, run the
    following command:
    <pre>$ awk -F: '($3 == \"0\") {print}' /etc/passwd</pre>
    This should print only one line, for the user root.
    <br />
    If there is a finding, change the UID of the failing (non-root) user. If
    the account is associated with the system commands or applications the UID
    should be changed to one greater than <tt>0</tt> but less than
    <tt>1000</tt>. Otherwise assign a UID of greater than <tt>1000</tt> that
    has not already been assigned.
