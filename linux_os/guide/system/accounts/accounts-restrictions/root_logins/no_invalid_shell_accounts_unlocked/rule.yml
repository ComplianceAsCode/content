title: 'Verify Non-Interactive Accounts Are Locked'

description: |-
    Accounts meant for non-interactive purposes should be locked to prevent
    unauthorized access. Accounts with non-standard shells (those not defined in
    <tt>/etc/shells</tt>) should be locked using <tt>usermod -L</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Locking non-interactive accounts improves security by preventing potential
    misuse. While many systems configure these accounts with invalid strings,
    setting the shell field to <tt>nologin</tt> is also suggested

severity: medium

warnings:
    - general: |-
        Automatic remediation of this control is not recommended. Locking system accounts
        could be highly disruptive.
