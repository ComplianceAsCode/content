    {{{ full_name }}} Must Require Users To Re-Authenticate For Privilege Escalation.

vuldiscussion: |-
    The "su" program allows to run commands with a substitute user and
    group ID. It is commonly used to run commands as the root user. Limiting
    access to such command is considered a good security practice.

checktext: |-
    Run the following command to check if the line is present:
     grep pam_wheel /etc/pam.d/su
    The output should contain the following line:
     auth             required        pam_wheel.so use_uid

    If the line is not in the file or it is commented, then this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to require users to be in the "wheel" group to run "su" command.

    In file "/etc/pam.d/su", uncomment the following line:

    "#auth    required    pam_wheel.so use_uid"

    $ sed '/^[[:space:]]*#[[:space:]]*auth[[:space:]]\+required[[:space:]]\+pam_wheel\.so[[:space:]]\+use_uid$/s/^[[:space:]]*#//' -i /etc/pam.d/su

    If necessary, create a "wheel" group and add administrative users to the group.
