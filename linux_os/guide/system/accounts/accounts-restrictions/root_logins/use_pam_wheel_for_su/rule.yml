title: 'Enforce usage of pam_wheel for su authentication'

description: |-
    To ensure that only users who are members of the <tt>wheel</tt> group can
    run commands with altered privileges through the <tt>su</tt> command, make
    sure that the following line exists in the file <tt>/etc/pam.d/su</tt>:
    <pre>auth             required        pam_wheel.so use_uid</pre>

rationale: |-
    The <tt>su</tt> program allows to run commands with a substitute user and
    group ID. It is commonly used to run commands as the root user. Limiting
    access to such command is considered a good security practice.
