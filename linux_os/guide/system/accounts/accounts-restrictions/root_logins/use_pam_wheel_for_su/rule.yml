title: 'Enforce usage of pam_wheel for su authentication'

description: |-
    To ensure that only users who are members of the <tt>wheel</tt> group can
    run commands with altered privileges through the <tt>su</tt> command, make
    sure that the following line exists in the file <tt>/etc/pam.d/su</tt>:
    <pre>auth             required        pam_wheel.so use_uid</pre>

rationale: |-
    The <tt>su</tt> program allows to run commands with a substitute user and
    group ID. It is commonly used to run commands as the root user. Limiting
    access to such command is considered a good security practice.

ocil_clause: 'the line is not in the file or it is commented'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command to check if the line is present:
    <pre>grep pam_wheel /etc/pam.d/su</pre>
    The output should contain the following line:
    <pre>auth             required        pam_wheel.so use_uid</pre>

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to require users to be in the "wheel" group to run "su" command.

    In file "/etc/pam.d/su", uncomment the following line:

    "#auth    required    pam_wheel.so use_uid"

    $ sed '/^[[:space:]]*#[[:space:]]*auth[[:space:]]\+required[[:space:]]\+pam_wheel\.so[[:space:]]\+use_uid$/s/^[[:space:]]*#//' -i /etc/pam.d/su

    If necessary, create a "wheel" group and add administrative users to the group.

srg_requirement: '{{{ full_name }}} Must Require Users To Re-Authenticate For Privilege Escalation.'

vuldiscussion: |-
    Without re-authentication, users may access resources or perform tasks for which they do not have authorization.
    When operating systems provide the capability to escalate a functional capability, it is critical the user re-authenticate.
