title: 'Ensure that System Accounts Do Not Run a Shell Upon Login'

description: |-
    Some accounts are not associated with a human user of the system, and exist to
    perform some administrative function. Should an attacker be able to log into
    these accounts, they should not be granted access to a shell.
    <br /><br />
    The login shell for each local account is stored in the last field of each line
    in <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>. System accounts are those user accounts with a user ID
    less than UID_MIN, where value of UID_MIN directive is set in
    /etc/login.defs configuration file. In the default configuration UID_MIN is set
    to 1000, thus system accounts are those user accounts with a user ID less than
    1000. The user ID is stored in the third field. If any system account
    <i>SYSACCT</i> (other than root) has a login shell, disable it with the
    command: <pre>$ sudo usermod -s /sbin/nologin <i>SYSACCT</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    Ensuring shells are not given to system accounts upon login makes it more
    difficult for attackers to make use of system accounts.

ocil_clause: 'any system account (other than root) has a login shell'

ocil: |-
    To obtain a listing of all users, their UIDs, and their shells, run the
    command: <pre>$ awk -F: '{print $1 ":" $3 ":" $7}' /etc/passwd</pre> Identify
    the system accounts from this listing. These will primarily be the accounts
    with UID numbers less than UID_MIN, other than root. Value of the UID_MIN
    directive is set in /etc/login.defs configuration file. In the default
    configuration UID_MIN is set to 1000.

warnings:
    - functionality: |-
        Do not perform the steps in this section on the root account. Doing so might
        cause the system to become inaccessible.
