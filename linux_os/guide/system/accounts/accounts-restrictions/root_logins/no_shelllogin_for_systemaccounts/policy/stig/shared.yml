    {{{ full_name }}} system accounts must not have an interactive login shell.

    Ensuring shells are not given to system accounts upon login makes it more
    difficult for attackers to make use of system accounts.

    Verify that system accounts must not have an interactive login shell with the following command:

    $ awk -F: '($3&lt1000){print $1 ":" $3 ":" $7}' /etc/passwd

    root:0:/bin/bash
    bin:1:/sbin/nologin
    daemon:2:/sbin/nologin
    adm:3:/sbin/nologin
    lp:4:/sbin/nologin

    Identify the system accounts from this listing that do not have a nologin shell.

    If any system account (other than the root account) has a login shell and it is not documented with the information system security officer (ISSO), this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} so that all noninteractive accounts on the system do not have an interactive shell assigned to them.

    If the system account needs a shell assigned for mission operations, document the need with the information system security officer (ISSO).

    Run the following command to disable the interactive shell for a specific noninteractive user account:

    Replace &ltuser&gt with the user that has a login shell.

    $ sudo usermod --shell /sbin/nologin &ltuser&gt

    Do not perform the steps in this section on the root account. Doing so will cause the system to become inaccessible.
