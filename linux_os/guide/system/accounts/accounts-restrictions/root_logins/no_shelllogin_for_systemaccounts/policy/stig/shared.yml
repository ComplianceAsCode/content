    Ensuring shells are not given to system accounts upon login makes it more
    difficult for attackers to make use of system accounts.

    To obtain a listing of all users, their UIDs, and their shells, run the
    command:

    $ awk -F: '{print $1 ":" $3 ":" $7}' /etc/passwd

    Identify the system accounts from this listing. These will primarily be the accounts
    with UID numbers less than UID_MIN, other than root. Value of the UID_MIN
    directive is set in /etc/login.defs configuration file. In the default
    configuration UID_MIN is set to 1000.

    If any system account (other than root) has a login shell, then this is a finding.

    Configure {{{ full_name }}} so that all non-interactive accounts on the system have no interactive shell assigned to them.

    Run the following command to disable the interactive shell for a specific non-interactive user account:

    $ sudo usermod --shell /sbin/nologin nobody

    Do not perform the steps in this section on the root account. Doing so mightcause the system to become inaccessible.
