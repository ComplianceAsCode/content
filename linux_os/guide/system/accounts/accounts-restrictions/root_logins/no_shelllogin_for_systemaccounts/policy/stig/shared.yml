    {{{ full_name }}} system accounts must not have an interactive login shell.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Ensuring shells are not given to system accounts upon login makes it more
    difficult for attackers to make use of system accounts.

checktext: |-
    Verify that system accounts must not have an interactive login shell with the following command:

    $ awk -F: '($3&lt;1000){print $1 ":" $3 ":" $7}' /etc/passwd

    root:0:/bin/bash
    bin:1:/sbin/nologin
    daemon:2:/sbin/nologin
    adm:3:/sbin/nologin
    lp:4:/sbin/nologin

    Identify the system accounts from this listing that do not have a nologin shell.

    If any system account (other than the root account) has a login shell and it is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO), this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} so that all non-interactive accounts on the system do not have an interactive shell assigned to them.

    If the system account needs a shell assigned for mission operations, doucment the need with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO).

    Run the following command to disable the interactive shell for a specific non-interactive user account:

    Replace &lt;user&gt; with the user that has a login shell.

    $ sudo usermod --shell /sbin/nologin &lt;user&gt;

    Do not perform the steps in this section on the root account. Doing so will cause the system to become inaccessible.
