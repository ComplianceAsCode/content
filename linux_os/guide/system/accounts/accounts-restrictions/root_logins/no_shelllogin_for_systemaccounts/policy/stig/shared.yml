    {{{ full_name }}} system accounts must not have have login shell.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Ensuring shells are not given to system accounts upon login makes it more
    difficult for attackers to make use of system accounts.

    To obtain a listing of all users, their UIDs, and their shells, run the
    command:

    This requirement is Not Applicable for system accounts that require a shell for mission applications.

    $ awk -F: '{print $1 ":" $3 ":" $7}' /etc/passwd
    root:0:/bin/bash
    bin:1:/sbin/nologin
    daemon:2:/sbin/nologin
    adm:3:/sbin/nologin
    lp:4:/sbin/nologin



    Identify the system accounts from this listing. These will primarily be the accounts
    with UID numbers less than UID_MIN, other than root. Value of the UID_MIN
    directive is set in /etc/login.defs configuration file. In the default
    configuration UID_MIN is set to 1000.

    If any system account (other than root) has a login shell and it is not docmented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO)., this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} so that all non-interactive accounts on the system do not have an interactive shell assigned to them.

    If the system account needs a shell assigned for mission operations, doucment the need with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO).

    Run the following command to disable the interactive shell for a specific non-interactive user account:

    Replace &ltuser&gt with the user that has a login shell.

    $ sudo usermod --shell /sbin/nologin &ltuser&gt

    Do not perform the steps in this section on the root account. Doing so will cause the system to become inaccessible.
