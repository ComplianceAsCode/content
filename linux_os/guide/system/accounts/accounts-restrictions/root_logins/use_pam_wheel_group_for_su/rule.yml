title: 'Enforce Usage of pam_wheel with Group Parameter for su Authentication'

description: |-
    To ensure that only users who are members of the group set in the
    <tt>group</tt> pam_wheel parameter can run commands with altered
    privileges through the <tt>su</tt> command, make sure that the
    following line exists in the file <tt>/etc/pam.d/su</tt>:
    <pre>auth required pam_wheel.so use_uid group={{{ xccdf_value("var_pam_wheel_group_for_su") }}}</pre>

rationale: |-
    The <tt>su</tt> program allows to run commands with a substitute
    user and group ID. It is commonly used to run commands as the root
    user. Limiting access to such command is considered a good security
    practice.
