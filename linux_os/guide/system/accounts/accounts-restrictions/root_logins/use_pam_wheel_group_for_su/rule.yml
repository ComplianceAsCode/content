title: 'Enforce Usage of pam_wheel with Group Parameter for su Authentication'

description: |-
    To ensure that only users who are members of the group set in the <tt>group</tt> option of
    <tt>pam_wheel.so</tt> module can run commands with altered privileges through the <tt>su</tt>
    command, make sure that the following line exists in the file <tt>/etc/pam.d/su</tt>:
    <pre>auth required pam_wheel.so use_uid group={{{ xccdf_value("var_pam_wheel_group_for_su") }}}</pre>

rationale: |-
    The <tt>su</tt> program allows to run commands with a substitute user and group ID.
    It is commonly used to run commands as the root user.
    Limiting access to such command is considered a good security practice.

ocil_clause: 'the line is not in the file or it is commented'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command to check if the line is present:
    <pre>grep pam_wheel /etc/pam.d/su</pre>
    The output should contain the following line:
    <pre>auth required pam_wheel.so use_uid group={{{ xccdf_value("var_pam_wheel_group_for_su") }}}</pre>

warnings:
    - general: |-
        Note that <tt>ensure_pam_wheel_group_empty</tt> rule complements this requirement by
        ensuring the referenced group exists and has no members.
