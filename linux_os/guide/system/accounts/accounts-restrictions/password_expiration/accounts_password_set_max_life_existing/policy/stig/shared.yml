    {{{ full_name }}} user account passwords must have a 60-day maximum password lifetime restriction.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Any password, no matter how complex, can eventually be cracked. Therefore,
    passwords need to be changed periodically. If the operating system does
    not limit the lifetime of passwords and force users to change their
    passwords, there is the risk that the operating system passwords could be
    compromised.

checktext: |-
    Check whether the maximum time period for existing passwords is restricted to 60 days with the following commands:

    $ sudo awk -F: '$5 > 60 {print $1 "" "" $5}' /etc/shadow

    $ sudo awk -F: '$5 <= 0 {print $1 "" "" $5}' /etc/shadow

    If any results are returned that are not associated with a system account, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure non-compliant accounts to enforce a 60-day maximum password lifetime restriction.

    passwd -x 60 [user]
