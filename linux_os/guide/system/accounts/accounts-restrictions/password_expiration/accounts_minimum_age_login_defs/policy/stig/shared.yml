srg_requirement: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} passwords for new users or password changes must have a 24 hours/1 day minimum password lifetime restriction in /etc/login.defs.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Enforcing a minimum password lifetime helps to prevent repeated password
    changes to defeat the password reuse or history enforcement requirement. If
    users are allowed to immediately and continually change their password,
    then the password could be repeatedly changed in a short period of time to
    defeat the organization's policy regarding password reuse.

    Setting the minimum password age protects against users cycling back to a
    favorite password after satisfying the password reuse requirement.

    Verify {{{ full_name }}} enforces 24 hours/1 day as the minimum password lifetime for new user accounts.

    Check for the value of "PASS_MIN_DAYS" in "/etc/login.defs" with the following command:

    $grep -i pass_min_days /etc/login.defs

    PASS_MIN_DAYS 1

    If the "PASS_MIN_DAYS" parameter value is not "1" or greater, or is commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to enforce 24 hours/1 day as the minimum password lifetime.

    Add the following line in "/etc/login.defs" (or modify the line to have the required value):

    PASS_MIN_DAYS 1
