title: 'Set Root Account Password Maximum Age'

description: |-
    Configure the root account to enforce a {{{ xccdf_value("var_accounts_maximum_age_root") }}}-day maximum password lifetime restriction by running the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo chage -M {{{ xccdf_value("var_accounts_maximum_age_root") }}} root</pre>

rationale: |-
    Any password, no matter how complex, can eventually be cracked. Therefore,
    passwords need to be changed periodically. If the operating system does
    not limit the lifetime of passwords and force users to change their
    passwords, there is the risk that the operating system passwords could be
    compromised.

    Check whether the maximum time period for root account password is restricted to {{{ xccdf_value("var_accounts_maximum_age_root") }}} days with the following commands:

    $ sudo awk -F: '$1 == "root" {print $1 " " $5}' /etc/shadow

    Configure non-compliant accounts to enforce a {{{ xccdf_value("var_accounts_maximum_age_root") }}}-day maximum password lifetime restriction.
    $ sudo chage -M {{{ xccdf_value("var_accounts_maximum_age_root") }}} root
