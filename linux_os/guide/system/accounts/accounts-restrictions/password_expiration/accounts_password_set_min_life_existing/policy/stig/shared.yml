    {{{ full_name }}} passwords must have a 24 hours/1 day minimum password lifetime restriction in /etc/shadow.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Enforcing a minimum password lifetime helps to prevent repeated password
    changes to defeat the password reuse or history enforcement requirement. If
    users are allowed to immediately and continually change their password, the
    password could be repeatedly changed in a short period of time to defeat the
    organization's policy regarding password reuse.

    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} has configured the minimum time period between password changes for each user account is one day or greater with the following command:

    $ sudo awk -F: '$4 < 1 {print $1 " " $4}' /etc/shadow

    If any results are returned that are not associated with a system account, this is a finding.

    Configure non-compliant accounts to enforce a 24 hours/1 day minimum password lifetime:

    $ sudo chage -m 1 [user]
