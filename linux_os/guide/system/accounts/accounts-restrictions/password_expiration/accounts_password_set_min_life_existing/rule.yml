title: 'Set Existing Passwords Minimum Age'

description: |-
    Configure non-compliant accounts to enforce minimum password age of
    <tt><sub idref="var_accounts_minimum_age_login_defs" /></tt> days
    by running the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo chage -m <sub idref="var_accounts_minimum_age_login_defs" /> <i>USER</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    Enforcing a minimum password lifetime helps to prevent repeated password
    changes to defeat the password reuse or history enforcement requirement. If
    users are allowed to immediately and continually change their password, the
    password could be repeatedly changed in a short period of time to defeat the
    organization's policy regarding password reuse.

ocil: |-
    Check whether the minimum time period between password changes for each
    user account is <tt><sub idref="var_accounts_minimum_age_login_defs" /></tt>
    day(s) or greater by running the following command for each user:

    <pre>$ sudo chage -l <i>USER</i> | grep Minimum</pre>

    The output for each user should return something similary to the following:
    <pre>Minimum number of days between password change\t\t: <sub idref="var_accounts_minimum_age_login_defs" /></pre>
