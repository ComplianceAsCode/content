    {{{ full_name }}} user account passwords for new users or password changes must have a 60 day maximum password lifetime restriction in /etc/login.defs.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Any password, no matter how complex, can eventually be cracked. Therefore, passwords
    need to be changed periodically. If the operating system does not limit the lifetime
    of passwords and force users to change their passwords, there is the risk that the
    operating system passwords could be compromised.



    Setting the password maximum age ensures users are required to
    periodically change their passwords. Requiring shorter password lifetimes
    increases the risk of users writing down the password in a convenient
    location subject to physical compromise.

    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} enforces a 60-day maximum password lifetime for new user accounts by running the following command:

    $grep -i pass_max_days /etc/login.defs

    PASS_MAX_DAYS 60

    If the "PASS_MAX_DAYS" parameter value is greater than "60", or commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to enforce a 60-day maximum password lifetime.

    Add, or modify the following line in the "/etc/login.defs" file:

    PASS_MAX_DAYS 60
