title: 'Set Password Maximum Age'

description: |-
    To specify password maximum age for new accounts,
    edit the file <tt>/etc/login.defs</tt>
    and add or correct the following line:
    <pre>PASS_MAX_DAYS <sub idref="var_accounts_maximum_age_login_defs" /></pre>
    A value of 180 days is sufficient for many environments.
    The DoD requirement is 60.
    The profile requirement is <tt><sub idref="var_accounts_maximum_age_login_defs" /></tt>.

rationale: |-
    Any password, no matter how complex, can eventually be cracked. Therefore, passwords
    need to be changed periodically. If the operating system does not limit the lifetime
    of passwords and force users to change their passwords, there is the risk that the
    operating system passwords could be compromised.
    <br /><br />
    Setting the password maximum age ensures users are required to
    periodically change their passwords. Requiring shorter password lifetimes
    increases the risk of users writing down the password in a convenient
    location subject to physical compromise.

ocil: |-
    To check the maximum password age, run the command:
    <pre>$ grep PASS_MAX_DAYS /etc/login.defs</pre>
    The DoD and FISMA requirement is 60.
    A value of 180 days is sufficient for many environments.
