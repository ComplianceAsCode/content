    {{{ full_name }}} duplicate User IDs (UIDs) must not exist for interactive users.

vuldiscussion: |-
    To assure accountability and prevent unauthenticated access, interactive users must be identified and authenticated to prevent potential misuse and compromise of the system.

checktext: |-
    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} contains no duplicate User IDs (UIDs) for interactive users with the following command:

    $ sudo awk -F ":" 'list[$3]++{print $1, $3}' /etc/passwd

    If output is produced and the accounts listed are interactive user accounts, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Edit the file "/etc/passwd" and provide each interactive user account that has a duplicate User ID (UID) with a unique UID.
