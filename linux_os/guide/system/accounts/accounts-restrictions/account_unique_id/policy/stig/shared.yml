    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} contains no duplicate User IDs (UIDs) for interactive users.

    Check that the operating system contains no duplicate UIDs for interactive users with the following command:

    $ sudo awk -F ":" 'list[$3]++{print $1, $3}' /etc/passwd

    If output is produced and the accounts listed are interactive user accounts, this is a finding.

    Edit the file "/etc/passwd" and provide each interactive user account that has a duplicate User ID (UID) with a unique UID.
