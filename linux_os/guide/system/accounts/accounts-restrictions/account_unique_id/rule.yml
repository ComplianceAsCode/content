    Run the following command to check for duplicate account names:
    Check that the operating system contains no duplicate UIDs for interactive users by running the following command:
    <pre># awk -F ":" 'list[$3]++{print $1, $3}' /etc/passwd</pre>
    If output is produced, this is a finding.
    Configure the operating system to contain no duplicate UIDs for interactive users.
    Edit the file "/etc/passwd" and provide each interactive user account that has a duplicate UID with a unique UID.
