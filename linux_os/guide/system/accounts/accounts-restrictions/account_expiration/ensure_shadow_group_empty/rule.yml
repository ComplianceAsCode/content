title: 'Ensure shadow group is empty'

description: |-
    The shadow group allows system programs which require access the ability 
    to read the /etc/shadow file. No users should be assigned to the shadow group.

rationale: |-
    Any users assigned to the shadow group would be granted read access to the 
    /etc/shadow file. If attackers can gain read access to the /etc/shadow file, 
    they can easily run a password cracking program against the hashed passwords 
    to break them. Other security information that is stored in the /etc/shadow 
    file (such as expiration) could also be useful to subvert additional user 
    accounts.
