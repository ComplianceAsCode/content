title: 'Ensure shadow Group is Empty'

description: |-
    The shadow group allows system programs which require access the ability
    to read the /etc/shadow file. No users should be assigned to the shadow group.

rationale: |-
    Any users assigned to the shadow group would be granted read access to the
    /etc/shadow file. If attackers can gain read access to the /etc/shadow file,
    they can easily run a password cracking program against the hashed passwords
    to break them. Other security information that is stored in the /etc/shadow
    file (such as expiration) could also be useful to subvert additional user
    accounts.

ocil_clause: 'shadow group is not empty'

ocil: |-
    Run the following commands and verify no results are returned:
    <pre>
    grep ^shadow:[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]+ /etc/group
    awk -F: '($4 == "<shadow-gid>") { print }' /etc/passwd
    </pre>

warnings:
    - general: |-
       This rule remediation will ensure the group membership is empty in /etc/group. To avoid any
       disruption the remediation won't change the primary group of users in /etc/passwd if any
       user has the shadow GID as primary group.
