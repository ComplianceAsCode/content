title: 'Use Centralized and Automated Authentication'

description: |-
    Implement an automated system for managing user accounts that minimizes the
    risk of errors, either intentional or deliberate. This system
    should integrate with an existing enterprise user management system, such as
    one based on Identity Management tools such as Active Directory, Kerberos,
    Directory Server, etc.

rationale: |-
    A comprehensive account management process that includes automation helps to
    ensure the accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and
    promptly addressed. Enterprise environments make user account management
    challenging and complex. A user management process requiring administrators to
    manually address account management functions adds risk of potential
    oversight.

ocil_clause: 'the system is not using a centralized authentication mechanism, or it is not automated'

ocil: |-
    Verify that the system is integrated with a centralized authentication mechanism
    such as as Active Directory, Kerberos, Directory Server, etc. that has
    automated account mechanisms in place.
