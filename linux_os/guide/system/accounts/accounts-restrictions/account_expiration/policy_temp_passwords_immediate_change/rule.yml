title: 'Policy Requires Immediate Change of Temporary Passwords'

description: |-
    Temporary passwords for {{{ full_name }}} operating system logons must
    require an immediate change to a permanent password.

    Verify that a policy exists that ensures when a user is created, it is
    creating using a method that forces a user to change their password upon
    their next login.


rationale: |-
    Without providing this capability, an account may be created without a
    password. Nonrepudiation cannot be guaranteed once an account is created if
    a user is not forced to change the temporary password upon initial logon.

    Temporary passwords are typically used to allow access when new accounts
    are created or passwords are changed. It is common practice for
    administrators to create temporary passwords for user accounts that allow
    the users to log on, yet force them to change the password once they have
    successfully authenticated.

    Verify that a policy exists that ensures when a user is created, it is
    creating using a method that forces a user to change their password upon
    their next login.

    Configure the {{{ full_name }}} operating system to allow the use of a
    temporary password for system logons with an immediate change to a
    permanent password.

    Using one of the acceptable methods listed below, force a user to change
    their password on their next logon by replacing "[UserName]" in the one of the
    following commands:

    <pre># chage -d 0 [UserName]
    # passwd -e [UserName]</pre>
