title: 'Never Automatically Remove or Disable Emergency Administrator Accounts'

description: |-
    Emergency accounts are privileged accounts that are established in response
    to crisis situations where the need for rapid account activation is
    required. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account
    authorization processes. If these accounts are automatically disabled,
    system maintenance during emergencies may not be possible, thus adversely
    affecting system availability.

    Check to see if an emergency administrator account password or account expires with the following command:

    <pre># sudo chage -l [Emergency_Administrator]

    Password expires:never</pre>

    If <tt>Password expires</tt> or <tt>Account expires</tt> is set to anything other than <tt>never</tt>, this is a finding.


rationale: |-
    Emergency accounts are different from infrequently used accounts (i.e.,
    local logon accounts used by the organization's system administrators when
    network or normal logon/access is not available). Infrequently used
    accounts are not subject to automatic termination dates. Emergency accounts
    are accounts created in response to crisis situations, usually for use by
    maintenance personnel. The automatic expiration or disabling time period
    may be extended as needed until the crisis is resolved; however, it must
    not be extended indefinitely. A permanent account should be established for
    privileged users who need long-term maintenance accounts.

    To address access requirements the SUSE operating system can be integrated
    with enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms that meet or exceed
    access control policy requirements.
