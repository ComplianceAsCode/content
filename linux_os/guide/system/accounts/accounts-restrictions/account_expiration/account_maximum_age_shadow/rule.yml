title: 'Set Account Password Maximum Lifetime'

description: |-
    Configure all user accounts to enforce 24 hours/1 day or greater as the
    maximum password age.<br/><br/>

    Check the maximum time period between password changes for each user account with the following command:

    <pre># sudo awk -F':' '$5 &gt; <sub idref="var_accounts_maximum_age_login_defs" /> { print $1, $5 }' &lt; /etc/shadow

    smithj 90</pre>

    Change the maximum time period between password changes for each
    user account to <tt><sub idref="var_accounts_maximum_age_login_defs" /></tt> day with this command, replacing
    <tt>[USER]</tt> with the user account that must be changed:

    <pre># sudo passwd -x <sub idref="var_accounts_maximum_age_login_defs" /> [USER]</pre>

rationale: |-
    Enforcing a maximum password lifetime helps prevent repeated password
    changes to defeat the password reuse or history enforcement requirement. If
    users are allowed to immediately and continually change their password, the
    password could be repeatedly changed in a short period of time to defeat
    the organization's policy regarding password reuse.
