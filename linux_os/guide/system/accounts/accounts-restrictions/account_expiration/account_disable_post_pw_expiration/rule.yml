title: 'Set Account Expiration Following Inactivity'

description: |-
    To specify the number of days after a password expires (which
    signifies inactivity) until an account is permanently disabled, add or correct
    the following lines in <tt>/etc/default/useradd</tt>, substituting
    <tt><i>NUM_DAYS</i></tt> appropriately:
    <pre>INACTIVE=<i><sub idref="var_account_disable_post_pw_expiration" /></i></pre>
    A value of 35 is recommended; however, this profile expects that the value is set to
    <tt><sub idref="var_account_disable_post_pw_expiration" /></tt>.
    If a password is currently on the
    verge of expiration, then 35 days remain until the account is automatically
    disabled. However, if the password will not expire for another 60 days, then 95
    days could elapse until the account would be automatically disabled. See the
    <tt>useradd</tt> man page for more information.  Determining the inactivity
    timeout must be done with careful consideration of the length of a "normal"
    period of inactivity for users in the particular environment. Setting
    the timeout too low incurs support costs and also has the potential to impact
    availability of the system to legitimate users.

rationale: |-
    Disabling inactive accounts ensures that accounts which may not
    have been responsibly removed are not available to attackers
    who may have compromised their credentials.

ocil: |-
    To verify the <tt>INACTIVE</tt> setting, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep "INACTIVE" /etc/default/useradd</pre>
    The output should indicate the <tt>INACTIVE</tt> configuration option is set
    to an appropriate integer as shown in the example below:
    <pre>$ grep "INACTIVE" /etc/default/useradd
    INACTIVE=<sub idref="var_account_disable_post_pw_expiration" /></pre>
