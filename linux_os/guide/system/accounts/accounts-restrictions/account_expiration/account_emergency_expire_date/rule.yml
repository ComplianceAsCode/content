title: 'Assign Expiration Date to Emergency Accounts'

description: |-
    Emergency accounts are privileged accounts established in response to
    crisis situations where the need for rapid account activation is required.
    In the event emergency accounts are required, configure the system to
    terminate them after a documented time period. For every emergency account,
    run the following command to set an expiration date on it, substituting
    <tt><i>ACCOUNT_NAME</i></tt> and <tt><i>YYYY-MM-DD</i></tt>
    appropriately:
    <pre>$ sudo chage -E <i>YYYY-MM-DD ACCOUNT_NAME</i></pre>
    <tt><i>YYYY-MM-DD</i></tt> indicates the documented expiration date for the
    account. For U.S. Government systems, the operating system must be
    configured to automatically terminate these types of accounts after a
    period of 72 hours.

rationale: |-
    If emergency user accounts remain active when no longer needed or for
    an excessive period, these accounts may be used to gain unauthorized access.
    To mitigate this risk, automated termination of all emergency accounts
    must be set upon account creation.

    Verify emergency accounts have been provisioned with an expiration date of 72 hours.

    For every emergency account, run the following command to obtain its account aging and expiration information:

    $ sudo chage -l  emergency_account_name

    Verify each of these accounts has an expiration date set within 72 hours or as documented.

    Verify each of these accounts has an expiration date set within 72 hours or as documented.

    If any emergency accounts have no expiration date set or do not expire within 72 hours, this is a finding.

    Substitute "emergency_account_name" with the account to be created.

    $ sudo chage -E `date -d "+3 days" +%Y-%m-%d` emergency_account_name

    The automatic expiration or disabling time period may be extended as needed until the crisis
    is resolved.
