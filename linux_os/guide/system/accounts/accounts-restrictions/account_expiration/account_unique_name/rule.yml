title: 'Ensure All Accounts on the System Have Unique Names'

description: |-
    Although the <tt>useradd</tt> utility prevents creation of duplicate user
    names, it is possible for a malicious administrator to manually edit the
    <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> file and change the user name.

rationale: |-
    If a user is assigned a duplicate user name, the new user will be able to
    create and have access to files with the first UID for that username as
    defined in <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>.
