title: 'Ensure nologin Shell is Not Listed in /etc/shells'

description: |-
    The <tt>/sbin/nologin</tt> shell is used to restrict accounts from having login access
    and should not be listed as a valid login shell in <tt>/etc/shells</tt>.
    To verify that nologin is not listed in /etc/shells, run:
    <pre>$ grep nologin /etc/shells</pre>
    The command should return no output.

rationale: |-
    The <tt>/etc/shells</tt> is consulted by various programs to evaluate
    whether the user is somehow restricted. For example, the chsh utility will
    consult the file to determine if the user is allowed to change their shell.
