    Verify that {{{ full_name }}} contains no duplicate Group IDs (GID) for interactive users with the following command:

     $  cut -d : -f 3 /etc/group | uniq -d

    If the system has duplicate group ids, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Edit the file "/etc/group" and provide each group that has a duplicate Group ID (GID) with a unique GID.
