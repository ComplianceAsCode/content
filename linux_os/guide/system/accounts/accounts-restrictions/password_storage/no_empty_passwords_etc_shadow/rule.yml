title: 'Ensure There Are No Accounts With Blank or Null Passwords'

description: |-
    Check the "/etc/shadow" file for blank passwords with the
    following command:
    <pre>$ sudo awk -F: '!$2 {print $1}' /etc/shadow</pre>
    If the command returns any results, this is a finding.
    Configure all accounts on the system to have a password or lock
    the account with the following commands:
    Perform a password reset:
    <pre>$ sudo passwd [username]</pre>
    Lock an account:
    <pre>$ sudo passwd -l [username]</pre>

rationale: |-
    If an account has an empty password, anyone could log in and
    run commands with the privileges of that account. Accounts with
    empty passwords should never be used in operational environments.

ocil_clause: 'Blank or NULL passwords can be used'

ocil: |-
    To verify that null passwords cannot be used, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo awk -F: '!$2 {print $1}' /etc/shadow</pre>
    If this produces any output, it may be possible to log into accounts
    with empty passwords.


fixtext: |-
    Configure all accounts on {{{ full_name }}} to have a password or lock
    the account with the following commands:
    Perform a password reset:
    <pre>$ sudo passwd [username]</pre>
    Lock an account:
    <pre>$ sudo passwd -l [username]</pre>

srg_requirement: '{{{ full_name }}} must have no accounts with blank or null passwords.'

warnings:
    - general:
       Note that this rule is not applicable for systems running within a
       container. Having user with empty password within a container is not
       considered a risk, because it should not be possible to directly login into
       a container anyway.
