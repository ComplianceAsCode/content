    {{{ full_name }}} must have no accounts with blank or null passwords.

vuldiscussion: |-
    If an account has an empty password, anyone could log in and
    run commands with the privileges of that account. Accounts with
    empty passwords should never be used in operational environments.

checktext: |-
    To verify that null passwords cannot be used, run the following command:
     $ sudo awk -F: '!$2 {print $1}' /etc/shadow
    If this produces any output, it may be possible to log into accounts
    with empty passwords.

    If Blank or NULL passwords can be used, then this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure all accounts on {{{ full_name }}} to have a password or lock
    the account with the following commands:
    Perform a password reset:
     $ sudo passwd [username]
    Lock an account:
     $ sudo passwd -l [username]
