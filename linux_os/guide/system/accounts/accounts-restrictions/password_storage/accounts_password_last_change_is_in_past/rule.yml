    bypass any set password expiration.

ocil_clause: 'any interactive user password that has last change time in the future'

ocil: |-
    Verify that the interactive user account passwords last change time is not in the future
    The following command should return no output
    <pre>$ sudo expiration=$(cat /etc/shadow|awk -F ':' '{print $3}');
    for edate in ${expiration[@]}; do if [[ $edate > $(( $(date +%s)/86400 )) ]];
    then echo "Expiry date in future";
    fi; done </pre>

fixtext: |-
    Forcibly expire account is one possible solution to make sure that the policy will be followed.
    One possible approach to that automatically is:
    <pre>
          $ lines=$(cat /etc/shadow);
          $ for line in ${lines[@]}; do
             edate=$(echo $line|awk -F ':' '{print $3}');
             if [[ $edate > $(( $(date +%s)/86400 )) ]];then
               user=$(echo $line|awk -F ':' '{print $1}');
               sudo passwd -e ${user};
             fi;
           done
    </pre>
