title: 'Verify No .rhost Files Exist'

description: |-
    Local system users should not have a <tt>.rhost</tt> file in their home directory.

rationale: |-
    User configuration files with excessive or incorrect access may enable malicious users
    to steal or modify other users' data or to gain another user's system privileges.
    The <tt>.rhost</tt> file provides the "remote authentication" database for the rcp, rlogin, and
    rsh commands and the rcmd() function. These files bypass the standard
    password-based user authentication mechanism. They specify remote hosts and
    users that are considered trusted (i.e. are allowed to access the local system
    without supplying a password).

warnings:
    - general: |-
        Automatic remediation of this rule is not available due to the unique
        requirements of each system. Any .rhost files should be investigated
        and removed manually.

ocil: |-
    To check the system for the existence of any <tt>.rhost</tt> files,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo find /home -xdev -name .rhost</pre>
