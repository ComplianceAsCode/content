title: 'Ensure there are no legacy + NIS entries in /etc/shadow'

description: |-
    The <tt>+</tt> character in <tt>/etc/shadow</tt> file marks a place where
    entries from a network information service (NIS) should be directly inserted.

rationale: |-
    Using this method to include entries into <tt>/etc/shadow</tt> is considered legacy
    and should be avoided. These entries may provide a way for an attacker
    to gain access to the system.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: 'the file contains legacy lines'

ocil: |-
    To check for legacy lines in <tt>/etc/shadow</tt>, run the following command:
    <pre> grep '^\+' /etc/shadow</pre>
    The command should not return any output.
