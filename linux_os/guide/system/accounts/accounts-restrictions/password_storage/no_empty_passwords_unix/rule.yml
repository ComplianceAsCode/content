title: 'Prevent Login to Accounts With Empty Password'

description: |-
    If an account is configured for password authentication
    but does not have an assigned password, it may be possible to log
    into the account without authentication. Remove any instances of the
    <tt>nullok</tt> in
    <tt>/etc/pam.d/common-{password,auth,account,session,session-noninteractive}</tt>
    to prevent logins with empty passwords.

rationale: |-
    If an account has an empty password, anyone could log in and
    run commands with the privileges of that account. Accounts with
    empty passwords should never be used in operational environments.
