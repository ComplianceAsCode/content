    All {{{ full_name }}} interactive users must have a primary group that exists.

vuldiscussion: |-
    If a user is assigned the Group Identifier (GID) of a group that does not exist on the system, and a group
    with the Group Identifier (GID) is subsequently created, the user may have unintended rights to
    any files associated with the group.

checktext: |-
    Verify that all {{{ full_name }}} interactive users have a valid Group ID (GID).

    Check that the interactive users have a valid Group ID with the following command:

    $ sudo pwck -qr

    If the system has any interactive users with duplicate Group IDs, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure the system so that all GIDs are referenced in "/etc/passwd" are defined in "/etc/group".

    Edit the file "/etc/passwd" and ensure that every user's GID is a valid GID.
