title: 'Verify No .forward Files Exist'

description: |-
    The <tt>.forward</tt> file specifies an email address to forward the user's mail to.

rationale: |-
    Use of the <tt>.forward</tt> file poses a security risk in that sensitive data may
    be inadvertently transferred outside the organization. The .forward file
    also poses a risk as it can be used to execute commands that may perform
    unintended actions.
