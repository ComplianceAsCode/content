    {{{ full_name }}} must not allow blank or null passwords

vuldiscussion: |-
    If an account has an empty password, anyone could log in and
    run commands with the privileges of that account. Accounts with
    empty passwords should never be used in operational environments.

checktext: |-
    Verify that null passwords cannot be used with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -i nullok /etc/pam.d/system-auth /etc/pam.d/password-auth

    If output is produced, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Remove any instances of the "nullok" option in the "/etc/pam.d/password-auth" and "/etc/pam.d/system-auth" files to prevent logons with empty passwords.

    Note: Manual changes to the listed file may be overwritten by the "authselect" program.
