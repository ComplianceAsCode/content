    {{{ full_name }}} must not allow blank or null passwords.

vuldiscussion: |-
    If an account has an empty password, anyone could log in and run commands with the privileges of that account. Accounts with empty passwords should never be used in operational environments.

checktext: |-
    Verify that null passwords cannot be used with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -i nullok /etc/pam.d/system-auth /etc/pam.d/password-auth

    If output is produced, this is a finding.

    If the system administrator (SA) can demonstrate that the required configuration is contained in a PAM configuration file included or substacked from the system-auth file, this is not a finding.

fixtext: |-
    If PAM is managed with authselect, use the following command to remove instances of "nullok":

    $ sudo authselect enable-feature without-nullok

    Otherwise, remove any instances of the "nullok" option in the "/etc/pam.d/password-auth" and "/etc/pam.d/system-auth" files to prevent logons with empty passwords.

    Note: Manual changes to the listed file may be overwritten by the "authselect" program.
