title: 'Avoid using remember in pam_unix module'

description: |-
    The <tt>remember</tt> option stores the last n passwords for each user in <tt>/etc/security/opasswd</tt>,
    enforcing password history and preventing users from reusing the same passwords. However, this feature
    relies on the MD5 password hash algorithm, which is less secure. Instead, the <tt>pam_pwhistory</tt>
    module should be used. This module also stores the last n passwords in <tt>/etc/security/opasswd</tt>
    and it uses the password hash algorithm configured in the pam_unix module, such as yescrypt or SHA512,
    offering enhanced security.

rationale: |-
    Removing the <tt>remember</tt> argument ensures the use of a stronger password hashing algorithm.
    A more robust hash algorithm increases the difficulty for attackers to crack stored
    passwords in <tt>/etc/security/opasswd</tt>, thereby improving system security and
    protecting user credentials.
