title: 'Ensure there are no legacy + NIS entries in /etc/passwd'

description: |-
    The <tt>+</tt> character in <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> file marks a place where
    entries from a network information service (NIS) should be directly inserted.

rationale: |-
    Using this method to include entries into <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> is considered legacy
    and should be avoided. These entries may provide a way for an attacker
    to gain access to the system.

severity: medium

    <pre> grep '^\+' /etc/passwd</pre>
    The command should not return any output.
