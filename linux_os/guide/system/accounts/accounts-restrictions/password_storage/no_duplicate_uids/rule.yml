title: 'Ensure no duplicate UIDs exist'

description: |-
    Although the useradd program will not let you create a duplicate User ID (UID),
    it is possible for an administrator to manually edit the /etc/passwd file
    and change the UID field. Users must be assigned unique UIDs for
    accountability and to ensure appropriate access protections.

rationale: |-
    Users must be assigned unique UIDs for accountability and to ensure
