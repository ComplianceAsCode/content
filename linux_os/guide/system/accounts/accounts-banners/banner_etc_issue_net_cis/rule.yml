title: Ensure Remote Login Warning Banner Is Configured Properly

description: |-
    To configure the system remote login warning banner edit the <tt>/etc/issue.net</tt> file.
    The contents of this file is displayed to users prior to login from remote connections.
    Replace the default text with a message compliant with the local site policy.
    The message should not contain information about operating system version,
    release, kernel version or patch level.

    The recommended banner text can be tailored in the XCCDF Value <tt>xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_value_cis_banner_text</tt>:
    <pre>
    {{{ xccdf_value("cis_banner_text") }}}
    </pre>

rationale: |-
    Warning messages inform users who are attempting to login to the system of their legal
    status regarding the system and must include the name of the organization that owns
    the system and any monitoring policies that are in place. Displaying OS and patch level
    information in login banners also has the side effect of providing detailed system
    information to attackers attempting to target specific exploits of a system. Authorized
    users can easily get this information by running the <tt>uname -a</tt> command once they
    have logged in.
