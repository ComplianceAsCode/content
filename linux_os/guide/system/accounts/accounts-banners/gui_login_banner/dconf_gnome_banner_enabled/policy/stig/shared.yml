    Display of a standardized and approved use notification before granting access to the operating system
    ensures privacy and security notification verbiage used is consistent with applicable federal laws,
    Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.



    For U.S. Government systems, system use notifications are required only for access via login interfaces
    with human users and are not required when such human interfaces do not exist.

    Verify {{{ full_name }}} prevents a user from overriding settings for graphical user interfaces.

    Note: This requirement assumes the use of the {{{ full_name }}} default graphical user interface, Gnome Shell. If the system does not have any graphical user interface installed, this requirement is Not Applicable.

    Determine which profile the system database is using with the following command:

    $ sudo grep system-db /etc/dconf/profile/user

    system-db:local

    Check that graphical settings are locked from non-privileged user modification with the following command:

    Note: The example below is using the database "local" for the system, so the path is "/etc/dconf/db/local.d". This path must be modified if a database other than "local" is being used.

    $ sudo grep banner-message-enable /etc/dconf/db/local.d/*

    /org/gnome/login-screen/banner-message-enable

    If the output is not "/org/gnome/login-screen/banner-message-enable", the line is commented out, or the line is missing, this is a finding.

    $ sudo touch /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/session

    Add the following setting to prevent non-privileged users from modifying it:

    banner-message-enable

    Run the following command to update the database:

    $ sudo dconf update
