description: |-
    To configure the GUI system login banner edit <tt>/etc/gdm/banner</tt>.
    Replace the default text with a message compliant with the local site
    policy or a legal disclaimer.

    The DoD required text is either:
    <br /><br />
    <tt>You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that
    is provided for USG-authorized use only. By using this IS (which includes
    any device attached to this IS), you consent to the following conditions:
    <br />-The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS
    for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC
    monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law
    enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.
    <br />-At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.
    <br />-Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private,
    are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be
    disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose.
    <br />-This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access
    controls) to protect USG interests -- not for your personal benefit or
    privacy.
    <br />-Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent
    to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of
    privileged communications, or work product, related to personal
    representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and
    their assistants. Such communications and work product are private and
    confidential. See User Agreement for details.</tt>
    <br /><br />
    OR:
    <br /><br />
    <tt>I've read &amp; consent to terms in IS user agreem't.</tt>

rationale: |-
    Display of a standardized and approved use notification before granting
    access to the operating system ensures privacy and security notification
    verbiage used is consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders,
    directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.
    <br /><br />
    System use notifications are required only for access via login interfaces
    with human users and are not required when such human interfaces do not
    exist.
