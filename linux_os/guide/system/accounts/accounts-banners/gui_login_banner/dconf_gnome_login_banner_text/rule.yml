title: 'Set the GNOME3 Login Warning Banner Text'

description: |-
    In the default graphical environment, configuring the login warning banner text
    in the GNOME Display Manager's login screen can be configured on the login
    screen by setting <tt>banner-message-text</tt> to <tt>'<i>APPROVED_BANNER</i>'</tt>
    where <i>APPROVED_BANNER</i> is the approved banner for your environment.
    <br /><br />
    To enable, add or edit <tt>banner-message-text</tt> to
    {{% if 'ubuntu' not in product %}}
    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/{{{ dconf_gdm_dir }}}/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:
    <pre>[org/gnome/login-screen]
    banner-message-text='<i>APPROVED_BANNER</i>'</pre>
    Once the setting has been added, add a lock to
    <tt>/etc/dconf/db/{{{ dconf_gdm_dir }}}/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent user modification.
    For example:
    <pre>/org/gnome/login-screen/banner-message-text</pre>
    {{% else %}}
    <tt>/etc/gdm3/greeter.dconf-defaults</tt>. For example:
    <pre>[org/gnome/login-screen]
    banner-message-text='<i>APPROVED_BANNER</i>'</pre>
    {{% endif %}}
    After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.
    When entering a warning banner that spans several lines, remember
    to begin and end the string with <tt>'</tt> and use <tt>\n</tt> for new lines.

rationale: |-
    An appropriate warning message reinforces policy awareness during the logon
    process and facilitates possible legal action against attackers.

    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to display the Standard Mandatory DoD Notice and Consent Banner before granting access to the system.

    Note: If the system does not have a graphical user interface installed, this requirement is Not Applicable.

    Create a database to contain the system-wide graphical user logon settings (if it does not already exist) with the following command:

    $ sudo touch /etc/dconf/db/local.d/01-banner-message

    Add the following lines to the [org/gnome/login-screen] section of the "/etc/dconf/db/local.d/01-banner-message":

    banner-message-text='You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only.\nBy using this IS (which includes any device attached to this IS), you consent to the following conditions:\n-The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.\n-At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.\n-Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose.\n-This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect USG interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.\n-Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications, or work product, related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants. Such communications and work product are private and confidential. See User Agreement for details. '

    Note: The "\n" characters are for formatting only. They will not be displayed on the graphical interface.

    Run the following command to update the database:

    $ sudo dconf update
