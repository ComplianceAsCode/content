    <p><tt>It can not be scanned automatically, please check it manually.</tt></p>
    Warning banners contain warning information added on the system login page and are marked by all users who log in to the system.
    <br />
    Proper security warning information may increase the risk of system attacks or violate local laws and regulations.
    <br />
    openEuler security warning banners must be formulated by security department personnel and comply with local laws and regulations.
    <br />
    In addition, don't expose the system version, application server type, functions through warning banners, to prevent attackers from obtaining system information and launching attacks.
    <br />
    Run the <tt>cat</tt> command to check the warning banners in the <tt>/etc/motd</tt>, <tt>/etc/issue</tt>, and <tt>/etc/issue.net</tt> files. Check whether the information is reasonable.
