title: 'Warning Banners for System Accesses'

description: |-
    Each system should expose as little information about
    itself as possible.
    <br /><br />
    System banners, which are typically displayed just before a
    login prompt, give out information about the service or the host's
    operating system. This might include the distribution name and the
    system kernel version, and the particular version of a network
    service. This information can assist intruders in gaining access to
    the system as it can reveal whether the system is running
    vulnerable software. Most network services can be configured to
    limit what information is displayed.
    <br /><br />
    Many organizations implement security policies that require a
    system banner provide notice of the system's ownership, provide
    warning to unauthorized users, and remind authorized users of their
    consent to monitoring.
