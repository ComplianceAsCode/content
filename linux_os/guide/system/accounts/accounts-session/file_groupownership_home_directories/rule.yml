title: 'All Interactive User Home Directories Must Be Group-Owned By The Primary User'

description: |-
    Change the group owner of interactive users home directory to the
    group found in <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>. To change the group owner of
    interactive users home directory, use the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo chgrp <i>USER_GROUP</i> /home/<i>USER</i></pre>

    This rule ensures every home directory related to an interactive user is
    group-owned by an interactive user. It also ensures that interactive users
    are group-owners of one and only one home directory.

rationale: |-
    If the Group Identifier (GID) of a local interactive users home directory is
    not the same as the primary GID of the user, this would allow unauthorized
    access to the users files, and users that share the same group may not be
    able to access files that they legitimately should.

ocil_clause: 'the group ownership is incorrect'

ocil: |-
    To verify the assigned home directory of all interactive users is group-
    owned by that users primary GID, run the following command:
    <pre># ls -ld $(awk -F: '($3&gt;=1000)&amp;&amp;($7 !~ /nologin/){print $6}' /etc/passwd)</pre>

fixtext: |-
    Change the group owner of a local interactive user’s home directory to the group found in "/etc/passwd". To change the group owner of a local interactive user’s home directory, use the following command:

    Note: The example will be for the user "smithj", who has a home directory of "/home/smithj", and has a primary group of users.

    $ sudo chgrp users /home/smithj

srg_requirement: 'All {{{ full_name }}} local interactive user home directories must be group-owned by the home directory owner’s primary group.'

warnings:
    - general: |-
       Due to OVAL limitation, this rule can report a false negative in a
       specific situation where two interactive users swap the group-ownership
       of their respective home directories.
