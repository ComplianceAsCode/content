title: 'All Interactive User Home Directories Must Be Group-Owned By The Primary User'

description: |-
    Change the group owner of interactive users home directory to the
    group found in <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>. To change the group owner of
    interactive users home directory, use the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo chgrp <i>USER_GROUP</i> /home/<i>USER</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    If the Group Identifier (GID) of a local interactive users home directory is
    not the same as the primary GID of the user, this would allow unauthorized
    access to the users files, and users that share the same group may not be
    able to access files that they legitimately should.

ocil_clause: 'the group ownership is incorrect'

ocil: |-
    To verify the assigned home directory of all interactive users is group-
    owned by that users primary GID, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo ls -ld $ (egrep ':[0-9]{4}' /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f6)</pre>
