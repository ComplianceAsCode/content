title: 'Ensure Home Directories are Created for New Users'

description: |-
    All local interactive user accounts, upon creation, should be assigned a home directory.
    <br /><br />
    Configure the operating system to assign home directories to all new local interactive users by setting the <tt>CREATE_HOME</tt>
    parameter in <tt>/etc/login.defs</tt> to <tt>yes</tt> as follows:
    <br /><br />
    <pre>CREATE_HOME yes</pre>

rationale: |-
    If local interactive users are not assigned a valid home directory, there is no place
    for the storage and control of files they should own.
