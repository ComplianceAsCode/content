    All {{{ full_name }}} local initialization files must have mode 0740 or less permissive.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Local initialization files are used to configure the user's shell environment upon logon. Malicious modification of these files could compromise accounts upon logon.

checktext: |-
    Verify that all local initialization files have a mode of "0740" or less permissive with the following command:

    Note: The example will be for the "smithj" user, who has a home directory of "/home/smithj".

    $ sudo ls -al /home/smithj/.[^.]* | more

    -rwxr-xr-x 1 smithj users 896 Mar 10 2011 .profile
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 smithj users 497 Jan 6 2007 .login
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 smithj users 886 Jan 6 2007 .something

    If any local initialization files have a mode more permissive than "0740", this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Set the mode of the local initialization files to "0740" with the following command:

    Note: The example will be for the smithj user, who has a home directory of "/home/smithj".

    $ sudo chmod 0740 /home/smithj/.&lt;INIT_FILE&gt;
