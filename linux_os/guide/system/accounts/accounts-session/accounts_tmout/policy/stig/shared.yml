    Terminating an idle session within a short time period reduces
    the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a

    Verify {{{ full_name }}} is configured to exit interactive command shell user sessions after 15 minutes of inactivity or less with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -i tmout /etc/profile /etc/profile.d/*.sh

    /etc/profile.d/tmout.sh:declare -xr TMOUT=900

    If "TMOUT" is not set to "900" or less in a script located in the "/etc/'profile.d/ directory, is missing or is commented out, this is a finding.
