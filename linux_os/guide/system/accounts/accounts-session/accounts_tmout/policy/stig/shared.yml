    {{{ full_name }}} must be configured so that all network connections associated with a communication session are terminated at the end of the session or after 15 minutes of inactivity from the user at a command prompt, except to fulfill documented and validated mission requirements.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Terminating an idle session within a short time period reduces
    the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a
    management session enabled on the console or console port that has been
    left unattended.

    Verify {{{ full_name }}} terminates all network connections associated with a communications session at the end of the session or based on inactivity with the following command:

    $ sudo grep -i tmout /etc/profile /etc/profile.d/*.sh

    etc/profile.d/tmout.sh:declare -xr TMOUT=900

    If "TMOUT" is not set to "900" or less in a script located in the /etc/profile.d/ directory to enforce session termination after inactivity, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to terminate user sessions after 900 seconds of inactivity.

    Add or edit the following line in "/etc/profile.d/tmout.sh":

     TMOUT=900
