    Verify {{{ full_name }}} enforces a delay of at least four seconds between console logon prompts following a failed logon attempt with the following command:

    $ grep -i fail_delay /etc/login.defs

    FAIL_DELAY 4

    If the value of "FAIL_DELAY" is not set to "4" or greater, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.
