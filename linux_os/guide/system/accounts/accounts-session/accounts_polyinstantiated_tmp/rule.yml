title: Configure Polyinstantiation of /tmp Directories

description: |-
  To configure polyinstantiated /tmp directories, first create the parent directories
  which will hold the polyinstantiation child directories. Use the following command:
  <pre>$ sudo mkdir --mode 000 /tmp/tmp-inst</pre>
  Then, add the following entry to <tt>/etc/security/namespace.conf</tt>:
  <pre>/tmp     /tmp/tmp-inst/            level      root,adm</pre>

rationale: |- 
  Polyinstantiation of temporary directories is a proactive security measure
  which reduces chances of attacks that are made possible by /tmp
  directories being world-writable.

  Run the following command to ensure that <tt>/tmp</tt> is configured as a
  polyinstantiated directory:
  <pre>$ sudo grep /tmp /etc/security/namespace.conf</pre>
  The output should return the following:
  <pre>/tmp     /tmp/tmp-inst/            level      root,adm</pre>
