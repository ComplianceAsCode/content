description: |-
    Check the file hash of the <tt>/root/.bashrc</tt> file to determine whether
    it has not been modified.
    Overlaps with the RPM verification, as it is provided by the 
    <tt>rootfiles</tt> package.

rationale: |-
    Code in <tt>.bashrc</tt> is executed on each login, so contents of this
    file have to be strictly controled.

severity: unknown
