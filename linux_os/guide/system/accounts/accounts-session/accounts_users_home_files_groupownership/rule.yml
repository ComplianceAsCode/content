title: 'All User Files and Directories In The Home Directory Must Be Group-Owned By The Primary User'

description: |-
    Change the group of a local interactive users files and directories to a
    group that the interactive user is a member of. To change the group owner of a
    local interactive users files and directories, use the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo chgrp <i>USER_GROUP</i> /home/<i>USER</i>/<i>FILE_DIR</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    If a local interactive users files are group-owned by a group of which the
    user is not a member, unintended users may be able to access them.
