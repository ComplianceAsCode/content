title: 'All User Files and Directories In The Home Directory Must Be Group-Owned By The Primary Group'

description: |-
    Change the group of a local interactive users files and directories to a
    group that the interactive user is a member of. To change the group owner of a
    local interactive users files and directories, use the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo chgrp <i>USER_GROUP</i> /home/<i>USER</i>/<i>FILE_DIR</i></pre>

    This rule ensures every file or directory under the home directory related
    to an interactive user is group-owned by an interactive user.

rationale: |-
    If a local interactive users files are group-owned by a group of which the
    user is not a member, unintended users may be able to access them.

ocil_clause: 'the group ownership is incorrect'

ocil: |-
    To verify all files and directories in interactive user home directory are
    group-owned by a group the user is a member of, run the
    following command:
    <pre>$ sudo ls -lLR /home/<i>USER</i></pre>

warnings:
    - general: |-
       Due to OVAL limitation, this rule can report a false negative in a
       specific situation where two interactive users swap the group-ownership
       of folders or files in their respective home directories.
