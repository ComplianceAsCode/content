    We have the home dirs, but to test their ownership we need a "file_object" and not a password

    content from the previous local variable.

    #### creation of test ####
    Perform the test to ensure that all home dirs are owned by an interactive user. 
    This test will make sure that no foreign or system user is owner of an existing home dir.
    However, this can't ensure that one local interactive user is the owner of only one home dir.
    Currently this is an OVAL limitation which we try to mitigate with a second test below.

  <!--
    We create an extra test to make sure that the number of home dirs and their respective owners
    are the same. This is to catch situations where one local user owns more than one home dir.
    However, we still can have a situation where two local users cross the ownership of their
    respective home dirs. Although very atypical, we should be aware of this possible false
    positive and that it is not possible to be solved with the current OVAL capabilities.
