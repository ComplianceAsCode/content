title: 'All Interactive User Home Directories Must Be Owned By The Primary User'

description: |-
    Change the owner of interactive users home directories to that correct
    owner. To change the owner of a interactive users home directory, use
    the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo chown <i>USER</i> /home/<i>USER</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    If a local interactive user does not own their home directory, unauthorized
    users could access or modify the user's files, and the users may not be able to
    access their own files.
