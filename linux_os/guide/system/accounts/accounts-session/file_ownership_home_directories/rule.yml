title: 'All Interactive User Home Directories Must Be Owned By The Primary User'

description: |-
    Change the owner of interactive users home directories to that correct
    owner. To change the owner of a interactive users home directory, use
    the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo chown <i>USER</i> /home/<i>USER</i></pre>

    This rule ensures every home directory related to an interactive user is
    owned by an interactive user. It also ensures that interactive users are
    owners of one and only one home directory.

rationale: |-
    If a local interactive user does not own their home directory, unauthorized
    users could access or modify the user's files, and the users may not be able to
    access their own files.

ocil_clause: 'the user ownership is incorrect'

ocil: |-
    To verify the home directory ownership, run the following command:
    <pre># ls -ld $(awk -F: '($3&gt;={{{ uid_min }}})&amp;&amp;($7 !~ /nologin/){print $6}' /etc/passwd)</pre>

warnings:
    - general: |-
       Due to OVAL limitation, this rule can report a false negative in a
       specific situation where two interactive users swap the ownership of
       their respective home directories.
