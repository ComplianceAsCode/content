title: 'User Initialization Files Must Not Run World-Writable Programs'

description: |-
    Set the mode on files being executed by the user initialization files with the
    following command:
    <pre>$ sudo chmod 0755 <i>FILE</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    If user start-up files execute world-writable programs, especially in
    unprotected directories, they could be maliciously modified to destroy user
    files or otherwise compromise the system at the user level. If the system is
    compromised at the user level, it is easier to elevate privileges to eventually
    compromise the system at the root and network level.

ocil_clause: 'files are executing world-writable programs'

ocil: |-
    To verify that local initialization files do not execute world-writable programs,
    execute the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo find /home -perm -002 -type f -name ".[^.]*" -exec ls -ld {} \;</pre>
    There should be no output.
