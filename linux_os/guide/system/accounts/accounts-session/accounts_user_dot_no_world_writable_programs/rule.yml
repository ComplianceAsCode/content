title: 'User Initialization Files Must Not Run World-Writable Programs'

description: |-
    Set the mode on files being executed by the user initialization files with the
    following command:
    <pre>$ sudo chmod o-w <i>FILE</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    If user start-up files execute world-writable programs, especially in
    unprotected directories, they could be maliciously modified to destroy user
    files or otherwise compromise the system at the user level. If the system is
    compromised at the user level, it is easier to elevate privileges to eventually
    compromise the system at the root and network level.

ocil_clause: 'user initialization files are executing world-writable programs'

ocil: |-
    Verify that local initialization files do not execute world-writable programs,
    execute the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo find /home -perm -002 -type f -name ".[^.]*" -exec ls -ld {} \;</pre>
    For all files listed, check for their presence in the local
    initialization files with the following command:
    Note: The example will be for a system that is configured to create
    users' home directories in the "/home" directory.
    <pre> sudo find /home/* -maxdepth 1 -type f -name \.\* -exec grep -H &lt;file&gt; {} \; </pre>

fixtext: |-
    Set the mode on files being executed by the local initialization files with the following command:

    $ sudo chmod 0755

srg_requirement: |-
    Local {{{ full_name }}} initialization files must not execute world-writable programs.
