    Local {{{ full_name }}} initialization files must not execute world-writable programs.

vuldiscussion: |-
    If user start-up files execute world-writable programs, especially in
    unprotected directories, they could be maliciously modified to destroy user
    files or otherwise compromise the system at the user level. If the system is
    compromised at the user level, it is easier to elevate privileges to eventually
    compromise the system at the root and network level.

checktext: |-
    Verify that local initialization files do not execute world-writable programs with the following command:

    Note: The example will be for a system that is configured to create user home directories in the "/home" directory.

     $ sudo find /home -perm -002 -type f -name ".[^.]*" -exec ls -ld {} \;

    If any local initialization files are found to reference world-writable files, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Set the mode on files being executed by the local initialization files with the following command:

    $ sudo chmod 0755 &lt;file&gt;
