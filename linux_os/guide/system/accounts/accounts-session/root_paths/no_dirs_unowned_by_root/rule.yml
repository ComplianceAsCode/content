title: 'Ensure that All Root''s Path Directories Are Owned by Root'

description: |-
    For each element in root's path, run:
    <pre># ls -ld <i>DIR</i></pre>
    and ensure that the directory is owned by the root user.

rationale: |-
    Directories in root's path that are not owned by root could allow
    unprivileged users to manipulate the execution environment of root,
    potentially leading to privilege escalation or execution of malicious code.
