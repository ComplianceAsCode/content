title: 'Ensure that All Entries in The Path of Root Are Directories'

description: |-
    For each element in root's path, run:
    <pre># ls -ld <i>DIR</i></pre>
    and ensure that the entry is a directory.

rationale: |-
    Locations in root's path that are not directories could cause unexpected behavior,
    such as executing scrips from unintended locations. Ensuring that all locations in
    root's path are directories helps maintain a secure environment for root.
