    All {{{ full_name }}} local interactive users must have a home directory assigned in the /etc/passwd file.

    If local interactive users are not assigned a valid home directory, there is no
    place for the storage and control of files they should own.

    Verify that interactive users on the system have a home directory assigned with the following command:

    $ sudo awk -F: '($3&gt=1000)&&($7 !~ /nologin/){print $1, $3, $6}' /etc/passwd

    smithk:x:1000:1000:smithk:/home/smithk:/bin/bash
    throckw:x:1001:1001:throckw:/home/throckw:/bin/bash

    Inspect the output and verify that all interactive users (normally users with a UID greater that 1000) have a home directory defined.

    If users home directory is not defined, this is a finding.
