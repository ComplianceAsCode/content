title: 'All Interactive Users Must Have A Home Directory Defined'

description: |-
    Assign home directories to all interactive users that currently do not
    have a home directory assigned.

    This rule checks if the home directory is properly defined in a folder which has
    at least one parent folder, like "user" in "/home/user" or "/remote/users/user".
    Therefore, this rule will report a finding for home directories like <tt>/users</tt>,
    <tt>/tmp</tt> or <tt>/</tt>.

rationale: |-
    If local interactive users are not assigned a valid home directory, there is no
    place for the storage and control of files they should own.

ocil: |-
    Verify that interactive users on the system have a home directory assigned with the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo awk -F: '($3&gt;=1000)&amp;&amp;($7 !~ /nologin/){print $1, $3, $6}' /etc/passwd</pre>

    Inspect the output and verify that all interactive users (normally users with a UID greater that 1000) have a home directory defined.

fixtext: |-
    Assign home directories to all local interactive users on {{{ full_name }}} that currently do not have a home directory assigned.

srg_requirement: 'All {{{ full_name }}} local interactive users must have a home directory assigned in the /etc/passwd file.'
