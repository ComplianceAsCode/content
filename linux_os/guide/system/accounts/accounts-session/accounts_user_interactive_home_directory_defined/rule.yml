title: 'All Interactive Users Must Have A Home Directory Defined'

description: |-
    Assign home directories to all interactive users that currently do not
    have a home directory assigned.

    This rule checks if the home directory is properly defined in a folder which has
    at least one parent folder, like "user" in "/home/user" or "/remote/users/user".
    Therefore, this rule will report a finding for home directories like <tt>/users</tt>,
    <tt>/tmp</tt> or <tt>/</tt>.

rationale: |-
    If local interactive users are not assigned a valid home directory, there is no
    place for the storage and control of files they should own.
