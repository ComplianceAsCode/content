title: 'Ensure that Users Path Contains Only Local Directories'

description: |-
    Ensure that all interactive user initialization files executable search
    path statements do not contain statements that will reference a working
    directory other than the users home directory.

rationale: |-
    The executable search path (typically the PATH environment variable) contains a
    list of directories for the shell to search to find executables. If this path
    includes the current working directory (other than the users home directory),
    executables in these directories may be executed instead of system commands.
    This variable is formatted as a colon-separated list of directories. If there is
    an empty entry, such as a leading or trailing colon or two consecutive colons,
    this is interpreted as the current working directory. If deviations from the
    default system search path for the local interactive user are required, they
    must be documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO).

ocil_clause: 'paths contain more than local home directories'

ocil: |-
    To verify that all interactive user initialization files executable search
    path statements do not contain statements that will reference a working
    directory other than the users home directory, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep -r PATH /home/</pre>
    Inspect the output for any PATH is references directories outside the home directory.
