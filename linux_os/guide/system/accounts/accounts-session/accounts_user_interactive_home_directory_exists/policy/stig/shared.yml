    All {{{ full_name }}} local interactive user home directories defined in the /etc/passwd file must exist.

vuldiscussion: |-
    If a local interactive user has a home directory defined that does not exist,
    the user may be given access to the / directory as the current working directory
    upon logon. This could create a Denial of Service because the user would not be
    able to access their logon configuration files, and it may give them visibility
    to system files they normally would not be able to access.

    Verify the assigned home directories of all interactive users on the system exist with the following command:

    $ sudo pwck -r

    user 'mailnull': directory 'var/spool/mqueue' does not exist

    The output should not return any interactive users.

    If users home directory does not exist, this is a finding.

    Create home directories to all local interactive users that currently do not have a home directory assigned. Use the following commands to create the user home directory assigned in "/etc/ passwd":

    Note: The example will be for the user smithj, who has a home directory of "/home/smithj", a UID of "smithj", and a Group Identifier (GID) of "users assigned" in "/etc/passwd".

    $ sudo mkdir /home/smithj
    $ sudo chown smithj /home/smithj
    $ sudo chgrp users /home/smithj
    $ sudo chmod 0750 /home/smithj
