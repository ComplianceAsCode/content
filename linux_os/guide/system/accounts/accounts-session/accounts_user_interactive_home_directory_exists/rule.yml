title: 'All Interactive Users Home Directories Must Exist'

description: |-
    Create home directories to all interactive users that currently do not
    have a home directory assigned. Use the following commands to create the user
    home directory assigned in <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>:
    <pre>$ sudo mkdir /home/<i>USER</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    If a local interactive user has a home directory defined that does not exist,
    the user may be given access to the / directory as the current working directory
    upon logon. This could create a Denial of Service because the user would not be
    able to access their logon configuration files, and it may give them visibility
    to system files they normally would not be able to access.

ocil_clause: 'users home directory does not exist'

ocil: |-
    Verify the assigned home directories of all interactive users on the system exist with the following command:

    <pre>$ sudo pwck -r

    user 'mailnull': directory 'var/spool/mqueue' does not exist</pre>

    The output should not return any interactive users.

fixtext: |-
    Create home directories to all local interactive users that currently do not have a home directory assigned. Use the following commands to create the user home directory assigned in "/etc/passwd":

    Note: The example will be for the user smithj, who has a home directory of "/home/smithj", a UID of "smithj", and a Group Identifier (GID) of "users assigned" in "/etc/passwd".

    $ sudo mkdir /home/smithj
    $ sudo chown smithj /home/smithj
    $ sudo chgrp users /home/smithj
    $ sudo chmod 0750 /home/smithj

srg_requirement: 'All {{{ full_name }}} local interactive user home directories defined in the /etc/passwd file must exist.'
