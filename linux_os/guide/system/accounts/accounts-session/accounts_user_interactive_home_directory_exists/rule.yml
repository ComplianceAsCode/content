title: 'All Interactive Users Home Directories Must Exist'

description: |-
    Create home directories to all interactive users that currently do not
    have a home directory assigned. Use the following commands to create the user
    home directory assigned in <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>:
    <pre>$ sudo mkdir /home/<i>USER</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    If a local interactive user has a home directory defined that does not exist,
    the user may be given access to the / directory as the current working directory
    upon logon. This could create a Denial of Service because the user would not be
    able to access their logon configuration files, and it may give them visibility
    to system files they normally would not be able to access.
