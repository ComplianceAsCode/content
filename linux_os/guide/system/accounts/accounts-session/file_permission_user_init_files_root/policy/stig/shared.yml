    All {{{ full_name }}} local initialization files must have mode 0740 or less permissive.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Local initialization files are used to configure the user's shell environment upon logon. Malicious modification of these files could compromise accounts upon logon.

checktext: |-
    Verify that all local initialization files have a mode of "0740" or less permissive with the following command:

    Note: The example will be for the "bingwa" user, who has a home directory of "/home/bingwa".

    $ find /home/bingwa/.[^.]* -maxdepth 0 -perm -740 -exec stat -c "%a %n" {} \; | more

    755 /home/bingwa/.somepermissivefile

    If any local initialization files are returned, this indicates a mode more permissive than "0740", and this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Set the mode of the local initialization files to "0740" with the following command:

    Note: The example will be for the wadea user, who has a home directory of "/home/wadea".

    $ sudo chmod 0740 /home/wadea/.&ltINIT_FILE&gt
