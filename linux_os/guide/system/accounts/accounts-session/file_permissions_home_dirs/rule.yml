title: 'Ensure that User Home Directories are not Group-Writable or World-Readable'

description: |-
    For each human user of the system, view the
    permissions of the user's home directory:
    <pre># ls -ld /home/<i>USER</i></pre>
    Ensure that the directory is not group-writable and that it
    is not world-readable. If necessary, repair the permissions:
    <pre># chmod g-w /home/<i>USER</i>
    # chmod o-rwx /home/<i>USER</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    User home directories contain many configuration files which
    affect the behavior of a user's account. No user should ever have
    write permission to another user's home directory. Group shared
    directories can be configured in sub-directories or elsewhere in the
    filesystem if they are needed. Typically, user home directories
    should not be world-readable, as it would disclose file names
    to other users. If a subset of users need read access
    to one another's home directories, this can be provided using
    groups or ACLs.
