    {{{ full_name }}} must define default permissions for all authenticated users in such a way that the user can only read and modify their own files.

vuldiscussion: |-
    Setting the most restrictive default permissions ensures that when new accounts are created, they do not have unnecessary access.

    Verify {{{ full_name }}} defines default permissions for all authenticated users in such a way that the user can only read and modify their own files with the following command:

    Note: If the value of the "UMASK" parameter is set to "000" in "/etc/login.defs" file, the Severity is raised to a CAT I.

    # grep -i umask /etc/login.defs

    UMASK 077

    If the value for the "UMASK" parameter is not "077", or the "UMASK" parameter is missing or is commented out, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
    Configure {{{ full_name }}} to define default permissions for all authenticated users in such a way that the user can only read and modify their own files.

    Add or edit the lines for the "UMASK" parameter in the "/etc/login.defs" file to "077":

    UMASK 077
