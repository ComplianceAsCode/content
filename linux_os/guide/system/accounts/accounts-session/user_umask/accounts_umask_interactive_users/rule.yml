title: 'Ensure the Default Umask is Set Correctly For Interactive Users'

description: 'Remove the <tt>UMASK</tt> environment variable from all interactive users initialization files.'

rationale: |-
    The umask controls the default access mode assigned to newly created files. A
    umask of 077 limits new files to mode 700 or less permissive. Although umask can
    be represented as a four-digit number, the first digit representing special
    access modes is typically ignored or required to be 0. This requirement
    applies to the globally configured system defaults and the local interactive
    user defaults for each account on the system.

ocil_clause: 'the above command returns no output, or if the umask is configured incorrectly'

ocil: |-
    Verify the <tt>UMASK</tt> setting is not configured for interactive users,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep -ri "UMASK" /home</pre>

fixtext: |-
    Remove the umask statement from all local interactive user's initialization files.

    If the account is for an application, the requirement for a umask less restrictive than "077" can be documented with the Information System Security Officer, but the user agreement for access to the account must specify that the local interactive user must log on to their account first and then switch the user to the application account with the correct option to gain the account's environment variables.

srg_requirement: '{{{ full_name }}} must set the umask value to 077 for all local interactive user accounts.'
