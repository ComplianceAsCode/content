title: 'User Initialization Files Must Be Owned By the Primary User'

description: |-
    Set the owner of the user initialization files for interactive users to
    the primary owner with the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo chown <i>USER</i> /home/<i>USER</i>/.*</pre>

    This rule ensures every initialization file related to an interactive user
    is owned by an interactive user.

rationale: |-
    Local initialization files are used to configure the user's shell environment
    upon logon. Malicious modification of these files could compromise accounts upon
    logon.

ocil_clause: 'they are not'

ocil: |-
    To verify all local initialization files for interactive users are owned by the
    primary user, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo ls -al /home/<i>USER</i>/.*</pre>
    The user initialization files should be owned by <i>USER</i>.

warnings:
    - general: |-
       Due to OVAL limitation, this rule can report a false negative in a
       specific situation where two interactive users swap the ownership of
       their respective initialization files.
