title: 'All User Files and Directories In The Home Directory Must Have a Valid Owner'

description: |-
    Either remove all files and directories from the system that
    do not have a valid user, or assign a valid user to all unowned
    files and directories. To assign a valid owner to a local
    interactive user's files and directories, use the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo chown -R <i>USER</i> /home/<i>USER</i></pre>

    This rule ensures every file or directory under the home directory related
    to an interactive user is owned by an interactive user.

rationale: |-
    If local interactive users do not own the files in their directories,
    unauthorized users may be able to access them. Additionally, if files are not
    owned by the user, this could be an indication of system compromise.

ocil_clause: 'the user ownership is incorrect'

ocil: |-
    To verify all files and directories in a local interactive user's
    home directory have a valid owner, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo ls -lLR /home/<i>USER</i></pre>

warnings:
    - general: |-
       Due to OVAL limitation, this rule can report a false negative in a
       specific situation where two interactive users swap the ownership of
       folders or files in their respective home directories.
