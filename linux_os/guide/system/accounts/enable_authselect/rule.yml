title: 'Enable authselect'


description: |-
    Configure user authentication setup to use the <tt>authselect</tt> tool.

    If authselect profile is selected, the rule will enable the {{{ xccdf_value("var_authselect_profile") }}} profile.


rationale: |-
    Authselect is a successor to authconfig.
    It is a tool to select system authentication and identity sources from a list of supported profiles
    instead of letting the administrator build the PAM stack with a tool.

    That way, it avoids potential breakage of configuration,
    as it ships several tested profiles that are well tested and supported and that each solve a use-case.
