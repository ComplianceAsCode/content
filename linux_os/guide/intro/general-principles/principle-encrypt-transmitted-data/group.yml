title: 'Encrypt Transmitted Data Whenever Possible'

description: |-
    Data transmitted over a network, whether wired or wireless, is susceptible
    to passive monitoring. Whenever practical solutions for encrypting
    such data exist, they should be applied. Even if data is expected to
    be transmitted only over a local network, it should still be encrypted.
    Encrypting authentication data, such as passwords, is particularly
    important. Networks of {{{ full_name }}} machines can and should be configured
    so that no unencrypted authentication data is ever transmitted between
    machines.
