		<para>If you envision committing code, and needing direct push access to the repository (vs
			GitHub's pull request system), send a quick hello to the mailing list introducing
			yourself. The community may already know you, but this is an opportunity to reintroduce
			yourself and update the community on areas you'd like to contribute to. This need not be
			formal; though don't forget to include your GitHub account name! Pending approval from
			an existing maintainer, you will be added to the OpenSCAP Content Developers group on
			GitHub: <ulink url="https://github.com/orgs/OpenSCAP/teams/content-authors"
