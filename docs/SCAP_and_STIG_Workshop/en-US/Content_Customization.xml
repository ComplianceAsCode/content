		<title>So, you wanna be a developer?</title>
		<para>Welcome! Making changes to the project requires posting a patch to the mailing list, so that it can be vetted. Once there, another commit-level project member must issue acknowledgement (“ACK”) to accept it, and then it can be pushed. Assuming another project member has not issued a NACK in protest first, that is! The following instructions assume familiarity with git and git-send-email, but project members are happy to provide tips if you encounter any roadblocks.</para>
		<para>To properly join the project you must first establish a few required accounts:
			<simplelist>
				<member>Join the <ulink url="https://fedorahosted.org/mailman/listinfo/scap-security-guide">mailing list</ulink>, it's how developers and users communicate.</member>
				<member>Create your <ulink url="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/">FedoraHosted account</ulink>. It formally registers you as a developer, and allows you to upload your public SSH key (required for commits).</member>
				<member>Once your FedoraHosted account is created, <ulink url="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/group/view/gitscap-security-guide">request membership to the SCAP Security Guide project</ulink>.</member>
				<member>Lastly, review a few coding standards: How to Create a New Guidance Item in XCCDF and How to Create a New Compliance Check in OVAL</member>

		<title>Cloning the Source</title>
		<para>If you've been given commit-level access, you will interface with the git repository over SSH. Change directory to where you'd like the source code to be placed (e.g. cd ~/MyProjects/) and run the following command:

NOTE: For this workshop, use /var/www/html/
<screen>
$ cd /var/www/html/
$ git clone ssh://git.fedorahosted.org/git/scap-security-guide.git

If you have not been given commit access, use the standard HTTP interface:
$ git clone ssh://git.fedorahosted.org/git/scap-security-guide.git
</screen>
		</para>

	<section>
		<title>Understanding the Code Tree</title>
		<para>You've now cloned the projects source code. A new directory, scap-security-guide, was created where you ran the clone command. Change directory into it and perform a directory listing:
<screen>
$ cd scap-security-guide; ls -l

		<title>Creating your first XCCDF rule</title>
		<para>For this workshop we will create a rule which mandates installation of the SCAP Security Guide RPM, and we'll identify failure (the lack of installation) as a CAT I / SEV 1 finding.</para>
		<para>The directory structure, and multiple XML files, can be a bit overwhelming at first. Change directory to  input/system/ and perform a directory listing:

		<para>To aid with multi-author content creation, the SSG project creates compartmented XCCDF files. These individual files are merged together during our Make/compilation process (more on that later!).</para>
		<para>In the directory listing above you'll notice auditing.xml, logging.xml, and a few directories. Since we're creating a rule that deals with software, change directory into software/ and perform a directory listing:

-rw-rw-r--. 1 shawn shawn  5635 Mar 14 20:51 updating.xml
</screen>
		</para>
		<para>As the SSG project relates to security, lets create the new rule within the integrity.xml section. Load that file in your favorite text editor, then place yourself one line above EOF:
<screen>
$ vim integrity.xml
{shift+g}
-
</screen>
</para>
<para>Your screen should be similar to the following:

<screen>
<!--FIXME 
The template for SSG XCCDF rules is below. Insert the following template into integrity.xml:
<Rule id="" severity="">
  <title></title>
  <description>
  </description>
  <ocil clause="">
    <package-check-macro package="" />
  </ocil>
  <rational>
  </rational>
  <oval id="" />
</Rule> -->
</screen>
		<para>Using the template above, create a rule which:
			<simplelist>
				<member>Has an XCCDF rule id of “package_scap-security-guide_installed” with a severity of “high”</member>
				<member>Has a human readable title of 'Install SCAP Security Guide”</member>
				<member>Outlines a method to install SSG. For example, “yum install scap-security-guide”</member>
				<member>States that “if SCAP Security Guide is not installed” this is a finding</member>
				<member>Includes the proper package name, scap-security-guide, in the package check macro</member>
				<member>Includes rational on why the SSG project is awesome, and should be installed</member>
				<member>Corresponds to a (currently non-existent) OVAL rule named “package_scap-security-guide_installed”</member>
			</simplelist>
		</para>
		<para>Your completed template will look similar to:
<screen>
<!-- FIXME
Done! Hopefully that wasn't to painful. If you're curious on where the “package-check-macro” comes from, check out RHEL6/transforms/shorthand2xccdf.xslt and search for lines that begin with “<xsl:template match="”
The shorthand2xccdf.xslt file contains many short-hand macros that are available, which inserts template text into final XCCDF output. Unfortunately, in a two hour workshop, we don't have enough time to properly cover all embedded XSLT transformations within the SSG. Feel free to direct questions to the public mailing list!
Now that the XCCDF language is written, let's see how it looks in the HTML guide. For this we will need to run a quick SSG compilation:
$ cd /var/www/html/scap-security-guide/RHEL6
$ make content

To ensure your XCCDF is still SCAP compliant, run a quick “make validate”:
$ make validate
oscap xccdf validate-xml output/ssg-rhel6-xccdf.xml
oscap oval validate-xml output/ssg-rhel6-oval.xml
oscap oval validate-xml output/ssg-rhel6-cpe-oval.xml
-->
</screen>
		</para>
		<para>As mentioned earlier, the output/ directory contains artifacts from the build. Using a web browser, view http://studentX/scap-security-guide/output/rhel6-guide.html. You'll notice your XCCDF Rule Title is now listed in the table of contents:
<screen>
Click on the “Install SCAP Security Guide” link, and you'll be brought to the newly created rule:


<!-- FIXME
You'll notice a few things:
1. The rendering from your <description> tag isn't very pretty, and line returns didn't keep.
2. References against DISA CCI and DISA's OS SRG were automatically added. When rules are not specifically mapped to a CCI or OS SRG, these “catch all” placeholders are inserted.
The <description> tag has the ability to handle XHTML arguments. Let's wrap our sample commands in <pre> tags, and re-run the build. Your XCCDF rule should now look like this:
-->


Once updated, re-run the build:
$ make clean; make content; make validate

Upon completion, refresh your web browser to see the updated content:

This looks much better. At this point we have a valid, functioning, XCCDF rule!
Now, onto OVAL content creation.
5.5   OVAL Authoring
OVAL standardizes the assessment and reporting of machine state. It's very comprehensive, with capabilities to examine boot-time and run-time configuration. MITRE has documented OVAL's built-in functions here:
http://oval.mitre.org/language/version5.10.1/ovaldefinition/documentation/linux-definitions-schema.html
The SSG project maintains all OVAL code under RHEL6/input/checks/, and provides a template utilities in RHEL6/input/checks/templates/. Change directories to templates/ and perform a directory listing:
$ cd /var/www/html/scap-security-guide/RHEL6/input/checks/templates/; ls
create_kernel_modules_disabled.py  packages_removed.csv
create_package_installed.py        README
create_package_removed.py          services_disabled.csv
create_permission_checks.py        services_enabled.csv
create_services_disabled.py        sysctl_values.csv
create_services_enabled.py         template_kernel_module_disabled
create_sysctl_checks.py            template_package_installed
file_dir_permissions.csv           template_package_removed
find_untemplated.py                template_permissions
kernel_modules_disabled.csv        template_service_disabled
Makefile                           template_service_enabled
output                             template_sysctl
packages_installed.csv

Before continuing to the next page, take a minute to review the README file. What is the process to create a template for checking if scap-security-guide is installed?
As noted in the README file, several CSV files are located within the templates/ directory. To automate the OVAL content:
1. Add scap-security-guide to the listing in packages_installed.csv:
$ echo “scap-security-guide” >> packages_installed.csv

2. Run “make templates”:
$ make templates

3. This process generated output/package_scap-security-guide_installed.xml. Load this file in a text editor for human-review:
$ vim output/package_scap-security-guide_installed.xml
		
	The newly created template:

OVAL contains many pre-defined functions. In this case, we make use of <linux:rpminfo_test> to check for the installation of scap-security-guide.


4. Run “make copy” to place package_scap-security-guide_installed.xml into the project:
$ make copy

5. Done! You've now added an OVAL rule to check for the existence of scap-security-guide!

		<title>Profiles</title>
		<para>With our XCCDF rule and OVAL content created, we must now add the rule to an XCCDF profile. Let's add this as a STIG requirement, placing it into the stig-rhel6-server profile.</para>
		<para>XCCDF profiles are retained within RHEL6/input/profiles/. Change directory and perform a directory listing to see available profiles:
<screen>
$ cd /var/www/html/scap-security-guide/RHEL6/input/profiles/; ls -l

-rw-rw-r--. 1 shawn shawn 17127 Mar 14 20:51 usgcb-rhel6-server.xml

Since we're adding this rule to the STIG profile, load stig-rhel6-server.xml:
$ vim stig-rhel6-server.xml
</screen>
		</para>
		<para>Upon loading the file, you will be presented with the XCCDF code behind the STIG profile:
<screen>
<!-- FIXME
XML Tag/Element
Description
<Profile id=“...”
XCCDF Profile Name
<title>
XCCDF Rule Title
<description>
Brief description of the XCCDF profile
<Profile... extends=“...”
Name of XCCDF profile to inherit
<select idref=“...”
XCCDF rule to include or modify

Should this rule be enabled in the profile? True | False

Particularly important when extending other XCCDF profiles, allowing you to enable/disable rules from the parent source.
Table 4: XCCDF Profile Tags
Using the existing code as a reference:
1. Add the package_scap-security-guide_installed rule into the STIG profile
2. Ensure the rule is selected

If added correctly, you will have inserted a line that matches the following:

		<title>Patch Creation & Submission</title>
		<para>Through this workshop we've made several modifications to the SSG source code. Specifically:
			<simplelist>
				<member>Creation of a new XCCDF rule, package_scap-security-guide_installed, which was placed into RHEL6/input/system/software/integrity.xml.</member>
				<member>Creation of a new OVAL rule, package_scap-security-guide_installed.xml, which also involved updating the OVAL template file RHEL6/input/checks/templates/packages_installed.csv.</member>
				<member>Modification of the STIG profile, located at RHEL6/input/profiles/stig-rhel6-server.xml.</member>
			</simplelist>
		</para>
		<para>We must now prepare our changes for submission back to the community, in the form of a patch. Change directories to /var/www/html/scap-security-guide/ and run “git commit”:
<screen>
$ cd /var/www/html/scap-security-guide/; git commit
# On branch master
#
# Changed but not updated:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   RHEL6/input/checks/templates/packages_installed.csv
#	modified:   RHEL6/input/profiles/stig-rhel6-server.xml
#	modified:   RHEL6/input/system/software/integrity.xml
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#	RHEL6/input/checks/package_scap-security-guide_installed.xml
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
</screen>
		</para>
		<para>From the output above, our patch must reflect changes to the “modified” files and include the net-new “untracked” file. To do so, run the following commands:
<screen>
$ git add RHEL6/input/checks/package_scap-security-guide_installed.xml 
$ git commit RHEL6/input/checks/templates/packages_installed.csv \ RHEL6/input/profiles/stig-rhel6-server.xml \
RHEL6/input/system/software/integrity.xml \
RHEL6/input/checks/package_scap-security-guide_installed.xml 
</screen>
		</para>
		<para>The “git commit” command will bring you into a vi editor, prompting you to enter details of your patch. The first line, which is the default location of your cursor at this point, is where to create the patch title. At the EOF you place details of the patch.</para>
		<para>Edit your patch content to reflect:
			<simplelist>
				<member>Patch title of “Added package_scap-security-guide_installed.xml to stig-rhel6-server profile”</member>
				<member>Patch description of “Added package_scap-security-guide_installed.xml into STIG profile, which will now mandate the installation of the SSG”</member>
			</simplelist>
		</para>
		<para>When done, your window will resemble the following:
<screen>
Once complete, save and exit (:wq).

Your local source tree has now identified and grouped your changes into a consolidated patch. Using the git utility, we must “export” these changes in the format of a patch file. To do so, run the following command:
$ git format-patch origin

0001-Added-package_scap-security-guide_installed.xml-to-s.patch
</screen>
		</para>
		<para>A newly created file, 0001-Added-package_scap-security-guide_installed.xml-to-s.patch, will be placed into your working directory.
The final step is to EMail this patch to the SSG project mailing list. Upon acknowledgement/signoff, you will be able to “git push” your changes into the project.</para>
