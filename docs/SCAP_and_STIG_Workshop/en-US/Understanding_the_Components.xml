			On Red Hat Enterpise Linux 6, SCAP content is stored under <code>/usr/share/xml/scap/</code>, with each content provider responsible for creating their own subdirectories. The SSG project deploys content into <code>/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/</code> with the following sub directories:

		<title>OpenSCAP</title>
		<para>The SCAP protocol suite contains multiple complex data exchange formats that are used to transmit important vulnerability, configuration, and other security data. Historically there have been few tools that provide a way to query this data in the needed format. This lack of tools makes the barrier to entry very high and discourages adoption of these protocols by the community. It's the goal of the OpenSCAP project to create a framework of libraries and tools to improve the accessibility of SCAP
and enhance the usability of the information it presents.</para>
		<para>SCAP is a protocol, akin to HTML, and consumers must use a protocol interpreter. OpenSCAP provides that functionality for Red Hat platforms.</para>

		<title>XCCDF</title>
		<para>As documented by NIST on their XCCDF specification page at <ulink url="http://scap.nist.gov/specifications/xccdf/" />:</para>
		<para><screen>XCCDF is a specification language for writing security checklists, benchmarks, and related kinds of documents. An XCCDF document represents a structured collection of security configuration rules for some set of target systems. The specification is designed to support information interchange, document generation, organizational and situational tailoring, automated compliance testing, and compliance scoring. The specification also defines a data model and format for storing results of benchmark compliance testing. The intent of XCCDF is to provide a uniform foundation for expression of security checklists, benchmarks, and other configuration guidance, and thereby foster more widespread application of good security practices.</screen></para>
		<para><screen>XCCDF documents are expressed in XML, and may be validated with an XML Schema-validating parser.</screen></para>
		<para><screen>Development of the XCCDF specification is being led by NSA, with contributions from other agencies and organizations. The current public draft of the specification document and related files can be downloaded below. A mailing list for XCCDF developers is available, please subscribe to participate in discussions. A publicly available archive of the XCCDF mailing list is also available.</screen></para>
		<para>Within the project, XCCDF content is retained in <filename>/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/</filename>.</para>
