		<title>Project Description</title>
		<para> The SCAP Security Guide (SSG) project delivers security guidance, baselines and associated
            validation mechanisms utilizing the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). SSG
            currently provides content for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (RHEL6) and JBoss Enterprise
            Application Server 5 (JBoss EAP5).</para>
        <para>In addition to hardening advice, SSG links back to compliance requirements in order to
            eease deployment activities, such as certification and accreditation. These include
            requirements in the U.S. Government (Federal, Defense, and Intelligence Community) as
            well as of the financial services and health care industries. For example, high-level
            and widely-accepted policies such as NIST 80-53 provide prose stating that System
            Administrators must audit "privileged user actions," but do not define what "privileged
            actions" are. The SSG bridges the gap between generalized policy requirements and
            specific implementation guidance, in SCAP formats to support automation whenever
            possible.</para>
