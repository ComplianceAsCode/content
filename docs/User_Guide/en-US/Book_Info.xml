		<para>The SCAP Security Guide (SSG) project delivers security guidance, baselines and associated validation
mechanisms utilizing the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP).</para>
		<para>The project provides practical security hardening advice for Red Hat technologies and products, and also
links it to compliance requirements in order to ease deployment activities, such as certification and accreditation. These include
requirements in the U.S. Government (Federal, Defense, and Intelligence Community) as well as of the financial services and health
care industries. The SSG bridges the gap between generalized policy requirements and specific implementation guidance, in SCAP
formats to support automation whenever possible.</para>
