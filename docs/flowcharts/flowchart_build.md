# content/build-scripts

This flowchart represents the high-level interaction of components under the `build-scripts`, `cmake` and `build` folders.

Note that colors are used to highlight components which interact with other folders under the `content` repository.

> ***NOTE***: Since the colors have only visual effects when presented in individual flowcharts, they are very useful when analyzing multiple flowcharts together.
