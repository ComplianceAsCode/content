== Introduction

The ComplianceAsCode (SSG) project delivers security guidance, baselines and
associated validation mechanisms utilizing the Security Content Automation
Protocol (SCAP). SSG provides content for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
In addition to hardening advice, SSG links back to compliance requirements in
order to eease deployment activities, such as certification and accreditation.
These include requirements in the U.S. Government (Federal, Defense, and
Intelligence Community) as well as of the financial services and health care
industries. For example, high-level and widely-accepted policies such as NIST
80-53 provide prose stating that System Administrators must audit "privileged
user actions," but do not define what "privileged actions" are. The SSG bridges
the gap between generalized policy requirements and specific implementation
guidance, in SCAP formats to support automation whenever possible.

The https://www.nsa.gov[National Security Agency]'s
https://www.iad.gov/iad/index.cfm[Information Assuranc Directorate] (NSA IAD)
is presidentially mandated to protect Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret
information that could reasonably be expected to cause damage to U.S. National
Security. As part of this mission, NSA develops and distributes configuration
guidance for operating systems. These guides are currently being used
throughout the U.S. government and by numerous entities as a security baseline
for their systems. The ComplianceAsCode project serves as NSA's upstream
source for https://www.nsa.gov/ia/mitigation_guidance/security_configuration_guides/operating_systems.shtml#linux2[Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system guidance].

The http://www.disa.mil/About/Our-Organization-Structure/OD-Field-Office/Field-Security-Operations[U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency, Field Security Operations]
(DISA FSO) authors hardening guidance known as Security Technical
Implementation Guides (https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/[STIGs]). These
documents, used throughout the U.S. military to harden systems, establish
formal security compliance baselines. The ComplianceAsCode project serves as
the usptream development source for
https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/downloads/?_dl_facet_stigs=operating-systems%2Cunix-linux[Red Hat STIG content]
and helps DISA FSO move towards their business objective of utilizing
SCAP-based formats to automate security compliance across U.S. military
organizations.

NIST publishes 'National Checklists' for software, which https://nvd.nist.gov/ncp/repository[as defined directly by NIST]:

“The National Checklist Program (NCP), defined by the http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#SP-800-70-Rev.2[NIST SP 800-70 Rev. 2], is
the U.S. Government repositiory of publicly available securiyy checklists (or
benchmarks) that provide detailed low level guidance on setting the security
configuration of operating systems and applications. NCP is migrating its
repository of checklists to conform to the Security Content Automation Protocol
(SCAP).”

The ComplianceAsCode project serves as the upstream repository for
https://nvd.nist.gov/ncp/checklist/811[Red Hat Enterprise Linux related checklists].

== Installing

By installing distribution packages, you will get the built content.
For example, on Red Hat-based distributions, those will be files under the `/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/` directory.
What files will that be depends on the distribution, but for example on Fedora, you will get the Fedora datastream at `/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-fedora-ds.xml`.


=== Installing from distribution packages

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7+
+
------------
$ sudo yum -y install scap-security-guide
------------

* Fedora
+
------------
$ sudo dnf -y install scap-security-guide
------------


=== Installing content from upstream

If you need to use upstream content rather than what is shipped in the distribution, you can download the nightly build, or build it yourself.

The nightly builds are performed by our link:https://jenkins.complianceascode.io/view/Maintenance%20Jobs/[Jenkins instance], in the nightly jobs. Below are direct links to the latest builds:

* link:https://jenkins.complianceascode.io/view/SCAP%20Security%20Guide/job/scap-security-guide-nightly-zip/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/scap-security-guide-nightly.zip[nightly build with OVAL 5.11]

If you wish to build the content yourself, please, refer to link:https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content/blob/master/docs/manual/developer_guide.adoc#3-building-complianceascode[Building Compliance as Code] section, in the link:https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content/blob/master/docs/manual/developer_guide.adoc[Developer Guide].


== Running a Scan

=== Command Line Interface (CLI)
This document outlines the usage of OpenSCAP, a command-line utility packaged within Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux which allows users to load, scan, validate, edit, and export SCAP documents.

See also https://static.open-scap.org/openscap-1.3/oscap_user_manual.html[OpenSCAP User Manual] for instructions how to use OpenSCAP.
Additional details regarding OpenSCAP can be found on the project homepage located at http://open-scap.org/.

Five arguments to OpenSCAP are needed to perform a system scan against the upstream DISA STIG profile:

    * --profile +
    Mandatory, identifies which profile to scan against

    * --results +
    Optional, indicates location to place XML formatted results

    * --report +
    Optional, indicates location to place HTML formatted results

    * datastream location +
    Mandatory, identifies location of SCAP Source Datastream file

Putting these arguments together, a properly formatted command would be:

----
$ sudo oscap xccdf eval --profile stig \
--results /tmp/results.xml \
--report /tmp/report.html \
/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel7-ds.xml
----

While the scan is running, you will see output similar to the following on your screen:

----
Title   Install AIDE
Rule    package_aide_installed
Ident   CCE-27024-9
Result  fail

Title   Configure Periodic Execution of AIDE
Rule    aide_periodic_cron_checking
Ident   CCE-27222-9
Result  notchecked

Title   Verify File Permissions with RPM
Rule    rpm_verify_permissions
Ident   CCE-26731-0
Result  fail

Title   Verify File Hashes with RPM
Rule    rpm_verify_hashes
Ident   CCE-27223-7
Result  pass
----

=== Results Interpretation

==== HTML Results

Just open the `/tmp/report.html` file in your favorite browser.

==== XML Results

Looking at the `/tmp/results.xml` file, you will notice lines similar to those below:

----
    <rule-result idref="ensure_gpgcheck_globally_activated" time="2013-10-22T10:03:43" severity="high" weight="1.000000">
      <result>pass</result>
      <ident system="http://cce.mitre.org">CCE-26709-6</ident>
      <check system="http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5">
        <check-content-ref name="oval:ssg:def:413" href="ssg-rhel6-oval.xml"/>
      </check>
    </rule-result>
    ......
    <rule-result idref="package_aide_installed" time="2013-10-22T10:03:43" severity="medium" weight="1.000000">
      <result>pass</result>
      <ident system="http://cce.mitre.org">CCE-27024-9</ident>
      <fix xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" system="urn:xccdf:fix:script:sh">
        yum -y install aide
      </fix>
      <check system="http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5">
        <check-content-ref name="oval:ssg:def:245" href="ssg-rhel6-oval.xml"/>
      </check>
    </rule-result>
----
    The XML above can be parsed as follows:

.Table XCCDF Rule Elements
|===
|XML Tag |Meaning
|<rule-result idref.....>|Identifies which XCCDF rule the result reflects
|<result>|Pass/Fail/Not Applicable
|<ident system.....>|Identifies corresponding CCE
|<fix>|Remediation actions, in bash, which will configure the system to be in compliance with the XCCDF rule
|<check system....>|Identifies which version of OVAL the check was authored against
|<check-content-ref ....>|Corresponding OVAL check name (name=....) and source OVAL file (href=....) this check came from. For general purpose users, this information can be ignored.
|===

=== Remediation

==== Bash Scripts

A Bash remediation script for each profile is shipped in `scap-security-guide` package.
The scripts can be found in `/usr/share/scap-security-guide/bash/` or if you build the project from source in `./build/bash`.

Moreover, ComplianceAsCode embeds bash remediation scripts into the SCAP content. This allows for SCAP compatible tools to extract these remediation scripts to aide in potential remediation of system misconfigurations.

OpenSCAP, the CLI delivered with Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems, contains the ability to transform XML results into an executable script. The syntax to generate a remediation script is:

----
$ oscap xccdf generate fix \
--result-id xccdf_org.open-scap_testresult_{profile-name} \
/root/ssg-results.xml
----

Replace {profile-name} with the profile the system was scanned against. For example, for stig-rhel6-server:

----
$ oscap xccdf generate fix \
--result-id xccdf_org.open-scap_testresult_stig \
/root/ssg-results.xml
----

You will receive output similar to the following:

----
$ oscap xccdf generate fix \
--result-id xccdf_org.open-scap_testresult_stig \
/root/ssg-results.xml

#!/bin/bash
# OpenSCAP fix generator output for benchmark: DRAFT Guide
# to the Secure Configuration of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8

# XCCDF rule: set_sysctl_net_ipv4_conf_default_rp_filter
# CCE-26915-9
#
# Set runtime for net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter
#
sysctl -q -n -w net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter=1

#
# If net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter present in
# /etc/sysctl.conf, change value to "1"
# else, add "net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 1" to /etc/sysctl.conf
#
if grep --silent ^net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter /etc/sysctl.conf ; then sed -i \
 's/^net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter.*/net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter \
 = 1/g' /etc/sysctl.conf
else
echo "" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
echo "# Set net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter to 1 per \
 security requirements" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
echo "net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 1" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
fi

# XCCDF rule: uninstall_xinetd
# CCE-27005-8
if rpm -qa | grep -q xinetd; then
yum -y remove xinetd
fi

# generated: 2013-07-05T13:56:30-04:00
# END OF SCRIPT		
----

This output could be redirected to a bash script, or built into your RHEL7 provisioning process (e.g. the %post section of a kickstart).

#### Ansible Playbooks

ComplianceAsCode embeds ansible remediation scripts into the SCAP content. This allows for SCAP compatible tools to extract these remediation scripts to aide in potential remediation of system misconfigurations. When using OpenSCAP with
Ansible, it is advisable to use the playbooks from https://github.com/RedHatOfficial. These playbooks are generated from the ComplianceAsCode project and are also available on Ansible Galaxy.

IMPORTANT: The minimum version of Ansible must be at the latest supported version. See https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/ansible-engine for information on the supported Ansible versions.

## Content Notes

### Note on content for Red Hat Virtualization 4

As RHV moves to be based on el8, the contents of `rhv4` will also move to be based on el8.

If you need content for RHV based on el7, use the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (`rhel7`) content.
