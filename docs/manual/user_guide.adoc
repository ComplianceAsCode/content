== Introduction

The SCAP Security Guide (SSG) project delivers security guidance, baselines and
associated validation mechanisms utilizing the Security Content Automation
Protocol (SCAP). SSG currently provides content for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
(RHEL6) and JBoss Enterprise Application Server 5 (JBoss EAP5).
In addition to hardening advice, SSG links back to compliance requirements in
order to eease deployment activities, such as certification and accreditation.
These include requirements in the U.S. Government (Federal, Defense, and
Intelligence Community) as well as of the financial services and health care
industries. For example, high-level and widely-accepted policies such as NIST
80-53 provide prose stating that System Administrators must audit "privileged
user actions," but do not define what "privileged actions" are. The SSG bridges
the gap between generalized policy requirements and specific implementation
guidance, in SCAP formats to support automation whenever possible.

The https://www.nsa.gov[National Security Agency]'s
https://www.iad.gov/iad/index.cfm[Information Assuranc Directorate] (NSA IAD)
is presidentially mandated to protect Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret
information that could reasonably be expected to cause damage to U.S. National
Security. As part of this mission, NSA develops and distributes configuration
guidance for operating systems. These guides are currently being used
throughout the U.S. government and by numerous entities as a security baseline
for their systems. The SCAP Security Guide project serves as NSA's upstream
source for https://www.nsa.gov/ia/mitigation_guidance/security_configuration_guides/operating_systems.shtml#linux2[Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system guidance].

The http://www.disa.mil/About/Our-Organization-Structure/OD-Field-Office/Field-Security-Operations[U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency, Field Security Operations]
(DISA FSO) authors hardening guidance known as Security Technical
Implementation Guides (http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/index.html[STIGs]). These
documents, used throughout the U.S. Military to harden systems, establish
formal security compliance baselines. The SCAP Security Guide project serves as
the usptream development source for http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/os/unix-linux/Pages/red-hat.aspx[Red Hat STIG content]
and helps DISA FSO move towards their business objective of utilizing
SCAP-based formats to automate security compliance across U.S. Military
organizations.

NIST publishes 'National Checklists' for software, which https://nvd.nist.gov/ncp/repository[as defined directly by NIST]:

“The National Checklist Program (NCP), defined by the http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#SP-800-70-Rev.2[NIST SP 800-70 Rev. 2], is
the U.S. Government repositiory of publicly available securiyy checklists (or
benchmarks) that provide detailed low level guidance on setting the security
configuration of operating systems and applications. NCP is migrating its
repository of checklists to conform to the Security Content Automation Protocol
(SCAP).”

The SCAP Security Guide project serves as the upstream repository for
Red Hat related checklists, such as the https://nvd.nist.gov/ncp/checklist/430[JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5 (JBoss EAP5)]
baseline.

== Source Code

1. On Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora make sure the packages 'openscap-utils' and 'python-lxml' and their dependencies are installed. As the project contains OVAL 5.8 content we require version 0.8 or later of openscap-utils (available in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2+). Additionally, if not present, git must be installed.
+
----
    $ sudo yum install git openscap-utils python-lxml
----
+
2. Download our source code:
+
----
    $ git clone git://git.fedorahosted.org/git/scap-security-guide.git
----
+
3. 'make' the SSG
+
----
    $ cd scap-security-guide
    $ make
    $ cd output
----

Discover the following:

* A pretty prose guide in RHEL6/output/rhel6-guide.html containing practical, actionable information for administrators
* A concise spreadsheet representation (potentially useful as the bases for an SRTM document) in RHEL6/output/rhel6-table-nistrefs-server.html
* Files that can be ingested by SCAP-compatible scanning tools, to enable automated checking:
** RHEL6/output/rhel6-xccdf-scap-security-guide.xml
** RHEL6/output/rhel6-oval-scap-security-guide.xml
** JBossEAP5/eap5-xccdf.xml

== Running a Scan


=== Available Profiles
SCAP Security Guide content is broken into groupings of security settings that correlate to a known policy. These groupings are named XCCDF Profiles, which not only reflect a grouping of security controls, but also any variable tailoring (e.g. password length customization). Available profiles are:

IMPORTANT: The SCAP Security Guide serves as the upstream development community for many government baselines. Due to upstream/downstream development relationships, SSG content will likely be ahead of officially released government baselines. If you require scrict conformance against published baselines, always refer to the issuers website for current content.

    * *stig-rhel6-server* +
    The Security Technical Implimentation Guides (STIGs) and the NSA SNAC Guides are the configuration standards for U.S. Department of Defense Information Assurance and Information Assurance-Enabled devices/systems. Since 1998, DISA Field Security Operations (DISA FSO) has played a critical role enhancing the security posture of DoD's security systems by providing the Security Technical Implimentation Guides. This profile was created as a collaboration effort between the National Security Agency, DISA FSO, and Red Hat, to form an upstream development community around the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 STIG.

    * *usgcb-rhel6-server* +
    The purpose of the United States Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB) initiative is to create security configuration baselines for Information Technology products widely deployed across federal agencies. The USGCB baseline evolved from the Federal Desktop Core Configuration mandate. The USGCH is a Federal government-wide initiative that provides guidance to agencies on what should be done to improve and maintain an effective configuration settings focusing primarily on security.

    * *rht-ccp* +
    The Red Hat Certified Cloud Provider (CCP) program ensures that public cloud providers meet "testing and certification requirements to demonstrate that they can deliver a safe, scalable, supported and consistent environment for enterprise cloud deployments. The Red Hat Certified Cloud Provider program provides customers, ISVs, and partners with the confidence that Red Hat product experts have validated the solution so that implimentations begin with a solid foundation" In order to establish an automated security testing process, Red Hat is exploring the use of SCAP profiles to evaluate Red Hat Enterprise Linux baselines/AMIs before public cloud providers release them to their customer sets. This does not reflect a statement of direction for Red Hat, but rather transparency as Red Hat evaluates best practices to evaluate the security posture of public cloud images.

=== Command Line Interface (CLI)
This document outlines the usage of OpenSCAP, a command-line utility packaged within Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux which allows users to load, scan, validate, edit, and export SCAP documents. Additional details regarding OpenSCAP can be found on the project homepage located at http://open-scap.org/.
Five arguments to OpenSCAP are needed to perform a system scan against the upstream DISA STIG profile:

    * --profile +
    Mandatory, identifies which profile to scan against

    * --results +
    Optional, indicates location to place XML formatted results

    * --report +
    Optional, indicates location to place HTML formatted results

    * --cpe +
    Mandatory, identifies location of CPE dictionary

    * xccdf location +
    Mandatory, identifies location of XCCDF file

Putting these arguments together, a properly formatted command would be:

----
$ sudo oscap xccdf eval --profile stig-rhel6-server \
--results /root/ssg-results.xml \
--report /root/ssg-report.xml \
--cpe /usr/share/scap/ssg/ssg-rhel6-cpe-dictionary.xml \
/usr/share/scap/ssg/ssg-rhel6-xccdf.xml
----

While the scan is running, you will see output similar to the following on your screen:

----
Title   Install AIDE
Rule    package_aide_installed
Ident   CCE-27024-9
Result  fail

Title   Configure Periodic Execution of AIDE
Rule    aide_periodic_cron_checking
Ident   CCE-27222-9
Result  notchecked

Title   Verify File Permissions with RPM
Rule    rpm_verify_permissions
Ident   CCE-26731-0
Result  fail

Title   Verify File Hashes with RPM
Rule    rpm_verify_hashes
Ident   CCE-27223-7
Result  pass
----

=== Result Interpretation

HTML Results
    asdasdasd
    asdasd
XML Results
    Looking at the results.xml file, you will notice lines similar to those below:

----
    <rule-result idref="ensure_gpgcheck_globally_activated" time="2013-10-22T10:03:43" severity="high" weight="1.000000">
      <result>pass</result>
      <ident system="http://cce.mitre.org">CCE-26709-6</ident>
      <check system="http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5">
        <check-content-ref name="oval:ssg:def:413" href="ssg-rhel6-oval.xml"/>
      </check>
    </rule-result>
    ......
    <rule-result idref="package_aide_installed" time="2013-10-22T10:03:43" severity="medium" weight="1.000000">
      <result>pass</result>
      <ident system="http://cce.mitre.org">CCE-27024-9</ident>
      <fix xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" system="urn:xccdf:fix:script:sh">
        yum -y install aide
      </fix>
      <check system="http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5">
        <check-content-ref name="oval:ssg:def:245" href="ssg-rhel6-oval.xml"/>
      </check>
    </rule-result>
----
    The XML above can be parsed as follows:

.Table XCCDF Rule Elements
|===
|XML Tag |Meaning
|<rule-result idref.....>|Identifies which XCCDF rule the result reflects
|<result>|Pass/Fail/Not Applicable
|<ident system.....>|Identifies corresponding CCE
|<fix>|Remediation actions, in bash, which will configure the system to be in compliance with the XCCDF rule
|<check system....>|Identifies which version of OVAL the check was authored against
|<check-content-ref ....>|Corresponding OVAL check name (name=....) and source OVAL file (href=....) this check came from. For general purpose users, this information can be ignored.
|===

=== Remediation
SCAP Security Guide embeds bash remediation scripts into the SCAP content. This allows for SCAP compatible tools to extract these remediation scripts to aide in potential remediation of system misconfigurations.
OpenSCAP, the CLI delivered with Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems, contains the ability to transform XML results into an executable script. The syntax to generate a remediation script is:

----
$ oscap xccdf generate fix \
--result-id xccdf_org.open-scap_testresult_{profile-name} \
/root/ssg-results.xml
----

Replace {profile-name} with the profile the system was scanned against. For example, for stig-rhel6-server:

----
$ oscap xccdf generate fix \
--result-id xccdf_org.open-scap_testresult_stig-rhel6-server \
/root/ssg-results.xml
----

You will receive output similar to the following:

----
$ oscap xccdf generate fix \
--result-id xccdf_org.open-scap_testresult_stig-rhel6-server \
/root/ssg-results.xml

#!/bin/bash
# OpenSCAP fix generator output for benchmark: DRAFT Guide
# to the Secure Configuration of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6

# XCCDF rule: set_sysctl_net_ipv4_conf_default_rp_filter
# CCE-26915-9
#
# Set runtime for net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter
#
sysctl -q -n -w net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter=1

#
# If net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter present in
# /etc/sysctl.conf, change value to "1"
# else, add "net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 1" to /etc/sysctl.conf
#
if grep --silent ^net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter /etc/sysctl.conf ; then sed -i \
 's/^net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter.*/net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter \
 = 1/g' /etc/sysctl.conf
else
echo "" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
echo "# Set net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter to 1 per \
 security requirements" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
echo "net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 1" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
fi

# XCCDF rule: uninstall_xinetd
# CCE-27005-8
if rpm -qa | grep -q xinetd; then
yum -y remove xinetd
fi

# generated: 2013-07-05T13:56:30-04:00
# END OF SCRIPT
