== Introduction

== Establishing Accounts

=== Mailing List
Join the mailing list at https://fedorahosted.org/mailman/listinfo/scap-security-guide.

=== GitHub
In May 2014 the SCAP Security Guide project moved the underlying source repository from FedoraHosted to GitHub.
To register for a free GitHub account, visit https://github.com/join. Registering for a GitHub account should not be troublesome.

=== OpenSCAP "Content Developers"
If you envision committing code, and needing direct push access to the repository (vs GitHub's pull request system), send a quick hello to the mailing list introducing yourself. The community may already know you, but this is an opportunity to reintroduce yourself and update the community on areas you'd like to contribute to. This need not be formal; though don't forget to include your GitHub account name! Pending approval from an existing maintainer, you will be added to the OpenSCAP Content Developers group on GitHub: https://github.com/orgs/OpenSCAP/teams/content-authors.

== Patch Creation

.... intro on GitHub pull request system .....

=== Fork SSG

Visit SSG's GitHub webpage at https://github.com/OpenSCAP/scap-security-guide. In the top-right corner, you will see a button that says "Fork." Click it.

image::Patching-fork.png[align="left"]

If you're a member of multiple GitHub groups/accounts, you will be asked for the fork destination. For most users it is sufficient to fork into their local account. To do so, click on your username/icon. For example:

image::Patching-forklocation.png[align="left"]

Congratulations, you've created a localized repository! Any changes you make will be localized, consider it your own sandbox. At this point you can 'git clone' the source over SSH, HTTPS, or Subversion.

image::Patching-githubURL.png[align="left"]

GitHub dynamically generates the appropriate git URLs, and dynamically generates zip-compressed archives should you desire them. In the right-most column, near the bottom, you will see the various git clone options:

=== Committing to your Local Repository

... text to describe ....

==== Edits via GUI
The GitHub website supports in-line editing of files. This is extremely convenient when making small changes, such as fixing typos. When you've found a file in need of edits, note the "Edit" button within the file's toolbar:

image::Patching-inline_edits.png[align="left"]

This will bring you to an in-line editor. Make your changes and scroll to the bottom of the webpage. You will notice a "Commit Changes" form. The first field is a one-line description of the change, while within the second (main body) you are expected to provide a detailed description of any changes. Your entries in this field should be as concise as possible while providing enough description for a community member to properly evaluate your changes, and the logic for making them. For example:

image::Patching-GUI_naming_scheme_sample.png[align="left"]

Click on "Commit changes," which will push the change to your local repository.

==== Edits via CLI
As mentioned earlier, GitHub creates a localized git repository, your own personal sandbox. Clone the repository locally, then 'git commit' and 'git push' changes as you normally would.

=== Issuing Pull Requests
When you're ready for your patches to be merged upstream, you must issue a "Pull Request."

1) Return to your local repositories webpage on GitHub.
   NOTE: If you've created local branches, ensure you've selected the appropriate branch that you'd like to submit patches against. For most people, this step can be ignored.

2) Click on "Pull Request," located in the top-right of the frame which lists your directory contents:

image::Patching-Pull_Requests.png[align="left"]

3) You will be brought to a listing of your commits. Click the green button labelled "Create Pull Request":

image::Patching-Create_Pull.png[align="left"]

4) You will be requested to input a patch title and description. Be concise, but thorough enough for a community member to understand logic behind your changes. Paste into the description field testing evidence (e.g. running testoval.py on any submitted OVAL, or before/after for remediation scripts).
After completing the form, select "Send pull request":

image::Patching-Send_Pull_Request.png[align="left"]

5) A community member will review your patch. They will either merge the patch upstream, indicate additional changes/documentation needed, or decline the patch. You'll automatically be notified via EMail of any status updates.

== Building Official RPMs

The following steps are required to build an official release of the SCAP Security Guide RPM. Please note that exceptionally few people have such access.

=== Required Accounts

 * Red Hat BugZilla
 * Bodhi
 * Koji

=== Required Software

 * fedpkg

=== Build Upstream

1) Update main scap-security-guide.spec file (scap-security-guide/scap-security-guide.spec) with new version (value of "redhatssgversion" variable). Ensure that "Release:" field contains 1%{?dist} (1 as release version). Add particular changelog entry (possibly verify for & fix whitespace noise).

2) Build and test the content (i.e. run 'make', 'make srpm', 'make rpm') to verify it builds successfully. Also try to scan some systems with selected profiles to see if the content works.

3) If it works, 'make clean' in the git repository to start with clean table. Make the source tarball via "make tarball". Upload the tarball to repos.ssgproject.org.

=== Build EPEL Release

1) file-in new EPEL-6 bugzilla (Summary = "Upgrade scap-security-guide package to scap-security-guide-X.Y.Z").
    NOTE: That bugzilla is required later when creating Bodhi update request. See below.
    NOTE: It would be created automa(g,t}ically once the "latest upstream source tarball checking Red Hat Bugzilla functionality" would realize there is new source tarball available. But since we want immediate upgrade, we create that big manually.
2) Take that BugZilla (state change NEW=>ASSIGNED)
3) Clone the scap-security-guide git repository via fedpkg tool (as documented in: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Join_the_package_collection_maintainers#Import.2C_Commit.2Cand_Build_Your_Package) section "Check out the module" and later ones). Split into coins for our case it means:
----
    $ fedpkg clone scap-security-guide
    $ cd scap-security-guide/
----

4) Ensure to change the git branch from master/ to origin/el6 via 'switch-branch' fedpkg's option (this ensures the changes will be actually committed into EPEL-6 branch, and not into the master, IOW F-21 branch, which we don't want. To see the list of available branches, issue the following:
----
    $ fedpkg switch-branch -l
    Locals:
    * master
    Remotes:
    orgin/el6
    origin/epel7
    origin/f18
    origin/f19
    origin/f20
    origin/master
----
To switch to the el6 branch, issue:
----
    $ fedpkg switch-branch el6
----
Branch el6 set up to track remote branch el6 from origin
Now it's possible to actually see the actual content of EPEL-6 branch:
----
    $ ls
    scap-security-guide.spec sources
----
scap-security-guide.spec is the SPEC file used for build of EPEL-6's RPM, sources text file contains md5sum of scap-security-guide tarball, which will be built during SRPM / RPM build.

5) To refresh both of them (*.spec & content of source) at once, it's possible to create source RPM package & import it into fedpkg.
Two important notes to mention here:

 - The spec file needs to be the updated one => it's necessary to update the actual epel-6 one with changes from upstream or replace the epel-6 one with upstream one (the latter is still possible because as of right now there aren't epel-6 downstream specific patches that wouldn't be present in upstream already. But should there be changes in the future, the epel-6 spec should be updated to include changes from upstream spec but simultaneoously to keep epel-6 custom patches. IOW just replacing epel-6's spec with upsteeam's one wouldn't work, but manual changes would be necessary).

 - The new source tarball needs to be the last one uploaded to repos.ssgproject.org (so md5sum would match during package build).

This means:
 * start with clean /rpmbuild directory structure
 * download latest tarball from repos.ssgproject.org into /rpmbuild/SOURCES
 * place the modified epel-6 spec file into /rpmbuild/SPECS
 * build the source RPM (result will be in /rpmbuild/SRPMS)

Next, return back to fedpkg & import the SRPM created in the previous step:
----
$ fedpkg import path_to_rpm
----
This will change content of 'sources' file (include new md5sum) & update scap-security-guide.spec.
----
$ git status [to see what will get committed]
$ git commit [to confirm changes. The commit message should contain the string "Resolves: rh bz# id_of_epel_bug_we_created_before"
----
Make scratch build to see the uploaded content (spec + tarball) would actually build in the Koji build system via:
----
$ fedpkg scratch-build --srpm path_to_srpm_created_locally_before
----
NOTE: scratch-build to work with actually committed git repository content, it requires the new content to already be "git push-ed" to the repository. But since we want to verify if the content would build ye before pushing changes into the EPEL-6 repository, we need to provide the --srpm option pointing fedpkg to the local source RPM package we have created one step before.

Once the scratch build passes (visible in Koji web interface, or also on command line), we can push the changes to the git repository via:
----
$ git push origin el6
----
After successful push, our / latest push should be visibile at (in el6 branch) http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/scap-security-guide.git/

Now it's safe (scratch build succeeded & we pushed the changes to the Fedora's git) to build real new package via:
----
$ fedpkg build
----
This again generates clickable link, at which point it's possible to see the progress / result of the build. Once the new package build in Koji finishes successfully, we flip the previously created EPEL-6 bug to MODIFIED (ASSIGNED => MODIFIED) and mention the new package name-version-release in the "Fixed in Version:" field of that bug.

6) Having new build available, it's necessary to schedule new Bodhi update (something like advisory to be tied with new package). I am using UI:

https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/new/

but there's command-line interface too (see [1] for further details).

Add New Update screen is shown (containing the following fields / items):

Add New Update

Package: name-version-release of Koji build goes here (e.g. scap-security-guide-0.1-16.el6)

Type: select one of

 - bugfix (intented for updates fixing bugs)
 - enhancement (intended for adding new features)
 - security (intended for fixing security flaws)
 - newpackage (intended for updates introducing new RPM packages)

options
Request: select "testing" option of

 - testing (intended for udpates that should reach -testing repo first, before -stable))
 - stable (updates directly into -stable (maybe fore critical))
 - none (don't use this)

Bugs: Provide previously created EPEL-6 RH BZ#, ensure the "Close bugs when update is stable" option is checked!

Note: Describe the changes in this text field (i.e. which bugs got fixed, which new functionality, etc). The content of this field appear in the advisory (sent on fedora-package-announce mailing list), when the build is pushed to -stable.

Suggest Reboot: [] (generally leave unchecked)

Enable karma automatism [v]
(If to use the karma threshhold the updates push system to use to decide if the build should be pushed to -stable channel or not)

Threshold for pushing to -stable [3]

(Minimum level of karma build needs to obtain from package testers to be able to push it into -stable channel)

Threshhold for unpushing [-3]

(Lower bound for negative karma, which is a sign for the push system to move the package from the -testing repository. IOW the build has received so much negative karma/experiences, it's not usable even for the -testing repository and should be rebuilt)

Once all the information is filed, click "Save Update." This will generate automated EMail about the build being pushed to -testing. After some time at the same day (depending on TZ) the build is pushed to -testing repository.

The maintainer should check Bohdi packages for that update for positive/negative karma/comments. If the build has reached positive karma >=3 it can be pushed to -stable (if it hasn't reavhed positive karma in >= 3 in 7 days, it will be pushed to -stable; 7 days is considered sufficient period). If there are signs of negative karma, the build should be either unpushed / deleted & new one made.

After 7 days the build can be pushed to -stable (under assumption it didn't reach positive karma >= 3 sooner), meaning in the next day or two it's reachable via yum subscribed to epel-6 repository directly.

== Creating Content

=== Directory Structure/Layout

==== Top Level Structure/Layout

Under the top level directory, there are directories and/or files for different products,
shared content, documentation, READMEs, Licenses, build files/configuration, etc.

For example:

[source,bash]
----
$ ls scap-security-guide/

build
BUILD.md
chromium
cmake
CMakeLists.txt
Contributors.md
Contributors.xml
debian8
DISCLAIMER
Dockerfile

oval.config.in
README.md
rhel6
rhel7
rhevm3
rhosp7
shared
sle11
sle12
tests

----

===== Important Top Level Directory Descriptions

|===
|Directory |Description

|```build```
| Can be used to build the content using CMake.

|```cmake```
| Contains the CMake build configuration files.

|```docs```
| Contains the Markdown Manuals, MAN pages, etc.

|```shared```
| Contains content, tools and utilities, scripts, etc. that can be used for
multiple products.

|```tests```
| Contains the test suite for content validation and testing.
|===

The remaining directories such as `fedora`, `rhel7`, etc. are product
directories.

===== Important Top Level File Descriptions

|===
|File |Description

|```BUILD.md```

|```README.md```
| Project README file

|===

==== Product Structure/Layout

When creating a new product, use the guidelines below for the directory layout:

* *Do not* use capital letters
* If product versions are required, use major versions only. For example,
`rhel7`, `ubuntu16`, etc.
* If the content to be produced does not matter on versions, *do not* add version
numbers. For example: `fedora`, `firefox`, etc.
* In addition, use only a maxdepth of 3 directories.

Following these guidelines help with the usability and browsability of
using and navigating the content.

For example:
[source,bash]
----
$ tree -d rhel7

rhel7
├── checks
│   └── oval
├── cpe
├── fixes
│   ├── ansible
│   └── bash
├── kickstart
├── overlays
├── profiles
├── templates
│   ├── csv
├── transforms
└── utils

13 directories
----

===== Product Level Directory Descriptions

|===

guide.
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
For any of the ```[red]#Required#``` directories that may not yet add content,
add a `.gitkeep` file for any empty directories.

== Updating Reference and Overlay Content

=== Reference Content

==== STIG Reference Content

=== STIG Overlay Content

`stig_overlay.xml` maps an official product/version STIG release with a
SSG product/version STIG release.


**`stig_overlay.xml` should never be manually created or updated. It should
always be generated using `create-stig-overlay.py`.**

==== Creating stig_overlay.xml

To create `stig_overlay.xml`, there are two things that are required: an
official non-draft STIG release from DISA containing a XCCDF file
(e.g. `U_Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_7_STIG_V1R1_Manual-xccdf.xml` and a SSG
generated XCCDF file (e.g. `ssg-rhel7-xccdf.xml`)

Example using `create-stig-overlay.py`:
----
$ shared/utils/create-stig-overlay.py --disa-xccdf=disa-stig-rhel7-v1r12-xccdf-manual.xml --ssg-xccdf=ssg-rhel7-xccdf.xml -o rhel7/overlays/stig_overlay.xml
----

==== Updating stig_overlay.xml

To update `stig_overlay.xml`, use the `create-stig-overlay.py` script as
mentioned above. Then, submit a pull request to replace the `stig_overlay.xml`
file that is needing to be updated. Please note that as a part of this
update rules that have been removed from the official STIG will be removed
here as well.

== Tools and Utilities

=== Testing OVAL Content

Located in `shared/utils` directory, the `testoval.py` script allows easy testing of oval
definitions. It wraps the definition and makes up an oval file ready for
scanning, very useful for testing new OVAL content or modifying existing ones.

Example usage:

----
$ ./shared/utils/testoval.py install_hid.xml
----

Create or add an alias to the script so that you don't have to type out the full path
everytime that you would like to use the `testoval.py` script.

----
$ alias testoval='/home/_username_/scap-security-guide/shared/utils/testoval.py'
----

An alternative is adding the directory where `testoval.py` resides to your PATH.

----
$ export PATH=$PATH:/home/_username_/scap-security-guide/shared/utils/
----

== Contributing with XCCDFs, OVALs and remediations

There are three main types of content in SSG, they are rules, defined using the XCCDF standard, checks, usually written in link:https://oval.mitre.org/language/about/[OVAL] format, and remediations, that can be executed on ansible, bash, anaconda installer and puppet.
SSG also has its own templating mechanism, allowing content writers to create models and use it to generate a number of checks and remediations.

The SSG content is primarily divided by platform and it can be seen on its directory structure:


====
[%hardbreaks]
*scap-security-guide/*
├── _build_
├── chromium
├── debian8
├── _docs_
├── fedora
├── firefox
├── jboss_eap6
├── jboss_fuse6
├── jre
├── opensuse
├── rhel6
├── rhel7
├── rhevm3
├── rhosp7
├── shared
├── sle11
├── sle12
├── ubuntu14
├── ubuntu16
├── webmin
├── wrlinux
====

Except for _build_ and _docs_, each directory contains checks and remediations that are useful and make sense to be used on that platform.
The shared directory contains checks and remediations that can be used by more than one platform. It also contains some utilities, that will be covered later.

=== Contributing

Contributions can be made for rules, checks, remediations or even utilities. There are different sets of guidelines for each type, for this reason there is a different topic for each of them.

==== Rules

...
// shared/references/cce-rhel-avail.txt

==== Checks

Checks are used to evaluate a Rule. They are written using a custom OVAL syntax and are stored as xml files inside the _checks/oval_ directory for the desired platform.
During the building process, SSG will transform the checks in OVAL compliant checks.

In order to create a new check, you must create a file in the appropriate directory, and name it the same as the Rule _id_. This _id_ will also be used as the OVAL _id_ attribute.
The content of the file should follow the OVAL specification with these exceptions:

 * The root tag must be `<def-group>`
 * If the OVAL check has to be a certain OVAL version, you can add `oval_version="oval_version_number"` as an attribute to the root tag.
   Otherwise if `oval_version` does not exist in `<def-group>`, it is assumed that the OVAL file applies to _any_ OVAL version.
 * Don't use the tags `<definitions>` `<tests>` `<objects>` `<states>`, instead, put the tags `<definition>` `<*_test>` `<*_object>` `<*_state>` directly inside the `<def-group>` tag.
 * *TODO* Namespaces

This is an example of a check, written using the custom OVAL syntax, that checks if the group that owns the file _/etc/cron.allow_ is the root:

[source,xml]
----
<def-group oval_version="5.11">
  <definition class="compliance" id="file_groupowner_cron_allow" version="1">
    <metadata>
      <title>Verify group who owns 'cron.allow' file</title>
      <affected family="unix">
        <platform>Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7</platform>
      </affected>
      <description>The /etc/cron.allow file should be owned by the appropriate
      group.</description>
    </metadata>
    <criteria>
      <criterion test_ref="test_groupowner_etc_cron_allow" />
    </criteria>
  </definition>
  <unix:file_test check="all" check_existence="any_exist"
  comment="Testing group ownership /etc/cron.allow" id="test_groupowner_etc_cron_allow"
  version="1">
    <unix:object object_ref="object_groupowner_cron_allow_file" />
    <unix:state state_ref="state_groupowner_cron_allow_file" />
  </unix:file_test>
  <unix:file_state id="state_groupowner_cron_allow_file" version="1">
    <unix:group_id datatype="int">0</unix:group_id>
  </unix:file_state>
  <unix:file_object comment="/etc/cron.allow"
  id="object_groupowner_cron_allow_file" version="1">
    <unix:filepath>/etc/cron.allow</unix:filepath>
  </unix:file_object>
----

=== Remediations

Remediations, also called fixes, are used to change the state of the machine, so that previously non-passing rules can pass. There can be multiple versions of the same remediation meant to be executed by different applications, more specifically Ansible, Bash, Anaconda and Puppet.
They also have to be idempotent, meaning that they must be able to be executed multiple times without causing the fixes to accumulate. The Ansible's language works in such a way that this behavior is built-in, however, for the other versions, the remediations must have it implemented explicitly.
Remediations also carry metadata that should be present at the beginning of the files. This meta data will be converted in link:https://scap.nist.gov/specifications/xccdf/xccdf_element_dictionary.html#fixType[XCCDF tags] during the building process. That is how it looks like and what it means:

[source,yml]
----
# platform = multi_platform_all
# reboot = false
# strategy = restrict
# complexity = low
# disruption = low
----

[cols="3*", options="header"]
|===
| Field | Description | Accepted values

| platform
| CPE name, CPE applicability language expression or even SSG wildcards declaring which platforms the fix can be applied
| link:https://github.com/OpenSCAP/openscap/blob/maint-1.2/cpe/openscap-cpe-dict.xml[Default CPE dictionary is packaged along with openscap]. Custom CPE dictionaries can be used. SSG wildcards are multi_platform_[all, oval, fedora, debian, ubuntu, linux, rhel, openstack, opensuse, rhev, sle].

| reboot
| Whether or not a reboot is necessary after the fix
| true, false


| strategy
| The method or approach for making the described fix. Only informative for now
| unknown, configure, disable, enable, patch, policy, restrict, update

| complexity
| The estimated complexity or difficulty of applying the fix to the target. Only informative for now
| unknown, low, medium, high


| disruption
| An estimate of the potential for disruption or operational degradation that the application of this fix will impose on the target. Only informative for now
| unknown, low, medium, high
|===

==== Ansible

Ansible remediations are stored as yml files in directory _/template/static/ansible_ under the targeted platform. They are meant to be executed by Ansible itself when requested by openscap, so they are
written using link:ttp://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro.html[Ansible's own language] with the following exceptions:

- The remediation content must be only the _tasks_ section of what would be a playbook
- The _tags_ section must be present in each task as shown in the example, it'll be replaced during the building process
- Notifications and handlers are not supported

Here is an example of a Ansible remediation that ensures the SELinux is enabled in grub:

[source,yml]
----
# platform = multi_platform_rhel,multi_platform_fedora
# reboot = false
# strategy = restrict
# complexity = low
# disruption = low
- name: Ensure SELinux Not Disabled in /etc/default/grub
  replace:
    dest: /etc/default/grub
    regexp: selinux=0
  tags:
    @ANSIBLE_TAGS@
----

==== Bash

Bash remediations are stored as shell script files in directory _/template/static/bash_ under the targeted platform. You can make use of any available command, but beware of too specific or complex solutions, as it may lead to a narrow range of supported platforms. There are a number of already written bash remediations functions available in _shared/bash_remediation_functions/_ directory, it is possible one of them is exactly what you are looking for.

Following, you can see an example of a bash remediation that sets the maximum number of days a password may be used:

[source,sh]
----
# platform = Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
. /usr/share/scap-security-guide/remediation_functions
populate var_accounts_maximum_age_login_defs

grep -q ^PASS_MAX_DAYS /etc/login.defs && \
  sed -i "s/PASS_MAX_DAYS.*/PASS_MAX_DAYS     $var_accounts_maximum_age_login_defs/g" /etc/login.defs
if ! [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "PASS_MAX_DAYS      $var_accounts_maximum_age_login_defs" >> /etc/login.defs
fi
----

==== Templating

Often, a set of very related checks and/or remediations needs to be created. Instead of creating them individually, you can use the templating mechanism provided by the SSG. It supports OVAL checks and Ansible, Bash, Anaconda and Puppet remediations.
In order to use this mechanism, you have to:

1) Create the template files, one for each type of file. Each one should be named `template_<TYPE>_<NAME>`. Where `<TYPE>` should be OVAL, ANSIBLE, BASH, ANACONDA or PUPPET and `<NAME>` is the what we will call hereafter the template name.
Use variables where appropriate. Variables must be surrounded by the symbol % and be uppercase, like `%NAME%` or `%PATH_TO_FILE%`.

This is an example of an OVAL template file called _template_OVAL_mount_options_

[source,xml]
----
<def-group>

And here is the Ansible template file called template_ANSIBLE_mount_options:

[source,yml]
----
# platform = multi_platform_all
# reboot = false
# strategy = configure
# complexity = low
# disruption = high
- name: "get back device associated to mountpoint"
  shell: mount | grep ' %MOUNTPOINT% ' |cut -d ' ' -f 1
  register: device_name
  check_mode: no
  tags:
    @ANSIBLE_TAGS@

- name: "get back device previous mount option"
  shell: mount | grep ' %MOUNTPOINT% ' | sed -re 's:.*\((.*)\):\1:'
  register: device_cur_mountoption
  check_mode: no
  tags:
    @ANSIBLE_TAGS@

- name: "get back device fstype"
  shell: mount | grep ' %MOUNTPOINT% ' | cut -d ' ' -f 5
  register: device_fstype
  check_mode: no
  tags:
    @ANSIBLE_TAGS@

- name: "Ensure permission %MOUNTOPTION% are set on %MOUNTPOINT%"
  mount:
    path: "%MOUNTPOINT%"
    src: "{{device_name.stdout}}"
    opts: "{{device_cur_mountoption.stdout}},%MOUNTOPTION%"
    state: "mounted"
    fstype: "{{device_fstype.stdout}}"
  tags:
    @ANSIBLE_TAGS@

2) Create a csv (comma-separated-values) file in the _/template/csv_ directory with the same name of the template followed by the extension _.csv_. It should contain all the instances you want to generate from the template, one per line. Use the line to supply values to the variables.

This is the file mount_options.csv

[source,csv]

/dev/shm,nodev
/dev/shm,noexec
/dev/shm,nosuid
/home,nosuid
/tmp,nodev
/tmp,noexec

3) Create a python file containing the generator class. The name of the file should start with _create__ and then be followed by the template name and the extension _.py_. The generator class name should also be the template name, in Camel case, followed by _Generator_.

You have to define the function _generate(self, target, argv)_, where the second argument represents the type of template being used in that moment and the third argument is an array containing all the values in a single line of the csv file. Therefore, this function will be called once for each type of template and each line of the csv file.

Inside the _generate_ function, you must call the other function _file_from_template_ passing as parameter one of the template files you've created, the variables you've defined and their values,  and the name of the output file, that should be named in the same manner as if it was created manually.

This is the file with the generator class for the mount_options template, it's called create_mount_options.py:

[source,python]

#
# create_mount_options.py
#        generate template-based checks for partition mount rights

import re

from template_common import FilesGenerator, UnknownTargetError


class MountOptionsGenerator(FilesGenerator):
    def generate(self, target, path_info):
        mount_point, mount_option = path_info
        point_id = re.sub('[-\./]', '_', mount_point)
        if mount_point:
            if target == "ansible":
                self.file_from_template(
                    "./template_ANSIBLE_mount_options",
                    {
                        "%MOUNTPOINT%":  mount_point,
                        "%MOUNTOPTION%": re.sub(' ', ',', mount_option),
                    },
                    "./ansible/mount_option{0}.yml", point_id + '_' + mount_option
                )

            elif target == "anaconda":
                self.file_from_template(
                    "./template_ANACONDA_mount_options",
                    {
                        "%MOUNTPOINT%":  mount_point,
                        "%MOUNTOPTION%": re.sub(' ', ',', mount_option),
                    },
                    "./anaconda/mount_option{0}.anaconda", point_id + '_' + mount_option
                )

            elif target == "oval":
                self.file_from_template(
                    "./template_OVAL_mount_options",
                    {
                        "%MOUNTPOINT%":  mount_point,
                        "%MOUNTOPTION%": mount_option,
                        "%POINTID%":     point_id,
                    },
                    "./oval/mount_option{0}.xml", point_id + "_" + mount_option
                )
            else:
                raise UnknownTargetError(target)

    def csv_format(self):
        return("CSV should contains lines of the format: "
               "mount_point,mount_option,[mount_option]+")
----

4) Finally, you have to ensure the SSG knows your template. To do that, you have to edit the file _shared/utils/generate-from-template.py_ and include the generator class you've just created and declare which csv file to use along with it.

This is an example of a patch to add a new template into the templating system:
