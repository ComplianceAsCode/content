# Legacy Notice

This project has been created by renaming SCAP Security Guide Project
(SSG). It was a project that provides security policies in SCAP format.
Project outgrown former name SCAP Security Guide, and changed its name
to imply broader scope than just SCAP. Therefore, the SCAP Security
Guide has been transformed into ComplianceAsCode/content, which better
describes the goal of the project.

This git repository was created by simply renaming and moving the SCAP
Security Guide (SSG) repository to a different GitHub organization.

Due to this history, the repository contains mentions of SCAP Security
Guide or `ssg`. Some of them are kept due to backwards compatibility.

For example, the output files produced by our build system still start
by `ssg-` prefix. Various Linux distributions still ship our files in
`scap-security-guide` package.
