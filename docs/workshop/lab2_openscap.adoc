= Lab Exercise 2: Automated Security Scanning Using ComplianceAsCode
:toc2:

:imagesdir: images

== Introduction

As you already know from `Lab Exercise 1`, the `ComplianceAsCode` project provides security content that can be used for automated security scanning of your system.

The lab environment is provided with OpenSCAP Scanner, which is a security scanner that works with `ComplianceAsCode` content.
The built content in `ComplianceAsCode` can be simply passed to OpenSCAP Scanner and the scan can be started right away.

OpenSCAP Scanner allows you to perform security compliance checks in a fully automated way.
It is possible to run the scan using either the `oscap` command line tool or the SCAP Workbench graphical application.
Several integrations for continuous scanning also exist, but in this lab exercise, you focus on one-off scanning.

.*Goals*

* Learn the basics of automated security scanning
* Learn how to use `ComplianceAsCode` for automated security scanning
* Learn how to do lightweight customization of a predefined security policy using a GUI tool
* Explore the possibilities for remediations of failing rules


.*Preconfigured Lab Environment*

* The `ComplianceAsCode` repository was cloned.
* The dependencies required for the `ComplianceAsCode` content build were installed using `yum install`:
** Generic build utilities: `cmake` and `make`
** Utilities for generating SCAP content: `openscap-scanner`
** Python dependencies for putting content together: `python3-pyyaml` and `python3-jinja2`
* The following OpenSCAP ecosystem packages were installed using `yum install`:
** The scanner: `openscap-scanner`
// ** Utilities for scanning remote systems: `openscap-utils`
// ** The GUI front end and datastream tool: `scap-workbench`

IMPORTANT: Content used in this lab has been altered to increase its educative potential, and is therefore different from the content in ComplianceAsCode upstream repository or the content in the scap-security-guide package shipped in Red Hat^(R)^ products for example.

== Hands-on Lab

The `ComplianceAsCode` project consists of human-readable files that are compiled into standard-compliant files that are difficult to read and edit directly.

For your convenience, the environment is already set up, so the content is built and ready to be used.
No worries, though--you get to rebuild it later in the exercise.

To start the hands-on section, take the following steps:

. Go to: link:https://gitpod.io/#WORKSHOP=lab2_openscap/https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content[Lab 2 Environment]
. Wait until all the steps being executed in the terminal are complete.


== Introduction to OpenSCAP Command Line Tool

OpenSCAP provides a command line tool called `oscap` that can be used for automated security scanning.

. You can verify a successful installation of `oscap` by running the following commands:
+
----
[... ]$ oscap --version

OpenSCAP command line tool (oscap) 1.3.6
Copyright 2009--2021 Red Hat Inc., Durham, North Carolina.

==== Supported specifications ====
SCAP Version: 1.3
XCCDF Version: 1.2
OVAL Version: 5.11.1
CPE Version: 2.3
CVSS Version: 2.0
CVE Version: 2.0
Asset Identification Version: 1.1
Asset Reporting Format Version: 1.1

...
----
+
Note that this command outputs the OpenSCAP version and versions of supported standards.

== Using `ComplianceAsCode` Content with OpenSCAP Command Line Tool

In this section, you find the security content for Ubuntu 20.04 from `ComplianceAsCode` source code and then you use the built content with the OpenSCAP command line tool to scan your machine.

. The content has been built, so you can take a look at the generated files in the `build` directory right away:
+
----
[... ]$ cd build
[... build]$ ls -1
build_config.yml
build.ninja
CMakeCache.txt

cmake_install.cmake
CPackConfig.cmake

----
+
There are multiple files produced by the build. The file that is going to be used with the OpenSCAP scanner is `ssg-ubuntu2004-ds.xml`. This file is called a SCAP Datastream.
+
. Check which compliance profiles are available for Ubuntu 20.04.
+
----
[... build]$ oscap info ssg-ubuntu2004-ds.xml
...
    Profiles:
        Title: CIS Ubuntu 20.04 Level 1 Server Benchmark
            Id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_cis_level1_server
        Title: CIS Ubuntu 20.04 Level 1 Workstation Benchmark
            Id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_cis_level1_workstation
        Title: CIS Ubuntu 20.04 Level 2 Server Benchmark
            Id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_cis_level2_server
        Title: CIS Ubuntu 20.04 Level 2 Workstation Benchmark

...
----
+
In the "Profiles:" section, you can see a list of profiles contained in the datastream.
The datastream contains multiple profiles that cover different security baselines for different purposes.
Each profile is identified by a profile ID.
+
The built `ComplianceAsCode` content is available as `scap-security-guide` package in Linux distributions (e.g. RHEL, Ubuntu, Suse, etc).
Unlike the upstream repository that you work with now, the package contains only content that is officially tested and supported.
Therefore, the `scap-security-guide` package in Linux distributions may contain less profiles that are available in the upstream repository.
+
. Perform your first baseline testing scan with the vanilla CIS Workstation Level 1 profile.
+
Note in the command below that you can skip the profile ID prefix to make the command simpler.
The real ID is `xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_cis_level1_workstation`.
+
The scanning command has to be executed by a privileged user using `sudo`, so the scanner can access parts of the system that are off-limits to common users.
The simplest scanner invocation can look like this:
+
----
sudo oscap xccdf eval --profile cis_level1_workstation ssg-ubuntu2004-ds.xml 
----
+
However, you also want to store the scan results so you can process them later.
Therefore, you have to supply additional arguments:

* Use `--results-arf` to get a machine-readable results archive that includes results of the OVAL scan
* Use `--report` to get a human-readable report (this can also be generated from ARF after the scan, as you see in the next optional step)
+
Now execute the following to run the scan and generate the HTML report as a side-effect:
+
----
[... build]$ sudo oscap xccdf eval --profile cis_level1_workstation --results-arf /tmp/arf.xml --report lab2_report.html --oval-results ssg-ubuntu2004-ds.xml
...
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You can also generate the HTML report later by executing these commands:

----
[... build]$ sudo rm -f lab2_report.html
[... build]$ oscap xccdf generate report /tmp/arf.xml > lab2_report.html
----
====

. On the lab environment, you navigate to the `build` folder.

. Right click the `lab2_report.html` file and select `Open with Live Server` to preview the file. Note: Your browser may block the pop-up. You must allow it when asked.
+
.Lab 2 HTML Report
image::lab2_html_report_folder.png[]
+
You see the compliance scan results for every security control in the CIS Workstation Level 1 security baseline profile in HTML format.
+
image:lab1.1-scapreport.png[]
+
Rules can have several types of results, but the most common ones are *pass* and *fail*, which indicate whether a particular security control has passed or failed the scan.
Other results you frequently encounter are *notapplicable* for rules that have been skipped as not relevant to the scanned system, and *notchecked* for rules without an automated check.

. Click the rule title in the HTML report to bring up a pop-up dialog that allows you to examine why a particular rule failed or passed.
+
For example, if a rule is testing file permissions on a list of files, it specifies which files failed and what their permission bits are.

== Customizing Existing SCAP Security Content Using SCAP Workbench

. This part can only be performed on you local machine if the SCAP Workbench is available to be installed, see instruction on how to install it on your Linux distribution.
If you are unable to install SCAP-Workbench on your machine then you can skip to the next section
.. link:https://www.open-scap.org/tools/scap-workbench/#download[Download SCAP Workbench].

. Download the `ssg-ubuntu2004-ds.xml` file to your own machine by clicking `Download...` on the file as shown in the following picture:
+
image:download_datastream.png[]

. Launch SCAP Workbench after installed.

. After Workbench starts, select `Other SCAP content` in the drop-down list and click `Load Content`. A file browser window appears.
. Locate the download `ssg-ubuntu2004-ds.xml` file and click `Open` to open the security compliance content.
+
image:load_content.png[]
+
image::scap_workbench_opened.png[SCAP Workbench opened, profile selected]

. Customize the `CIS Ubuntu 20.04 Level 1 Workstation Benchmark` baseline.
.. Select this profile from the `Profile` drop-down list.
.. Click `Customize`.
+
image:select_profile.png[]

.. In the `Customize Profile` pop-up window, leave the name generated by default for `New Profile ID` and click `OK`.
+
image:lab1.2-newprofileID.png[600,600]

.. Now you can select and deselect rules according to your organization's needs, and change values such as minimum password length, to tailor the compliance profile.

// .. *IMPORTANT*: Search for `verify file hash` and deselect the following rules, these rules can take a long time to process and might cause problems on systems with limited resources:

// * *Verify File Hashes with RPM*
// * *Verify and Correct File Permissions with RPM*

. After you are done customizing, click `OK` to save the profile.
You have now created a new custom profile.
+
image::scap_workbench_tailoring.png[SCAP Workbench content customization]

. You can run a test scan if you have all the dependencies installed on your machine.
But it will most likely end in `notapplicable` depending on your Linux Distribution.
.. Click `Scan` and inspect the results.
.. If there are errors thrown, you can just skip this test scan and move forward.
+

[TIP]
====
You can save the customization to a tailoring file by selecting `File->Save Customization Only`.

== Security Remediations with OpenSCAP, Red Hat Ansible Automation, and Bash
Putting the machine into compliance (for example, by changing its configuration) is called *remediation* in the SCAP terminology.
Remediation changes the configuration of the machine, and it is possible to lock yourself out or disable important workloads!
As a result, it is a best practice to test the remediation changes before deploying.

Go back to the Lab Environment in the browser.

. Generate an Ansible^(R)^ Playbook that puts your machine into compliance.
.. Generate a playbook from the scan results.
Use the `--fix-type ansible` option to request an Ansible Playbook with the fixes:
+
----
[... build]$ oscap xccdf generate fix --fix-type ansible --result-id "" /tmp/arf.xml > playbook.yml
----
+
You specified the empty `result-id` because `oscap` supports generation of fixes from a result file that has results from multiple scans. However, as there is only one result from a single scan, you do not have to specify the result ID explicitly.

. Check the output:
+
----
[... build]$ open playbook.yml
----

. Generate a Bash remediation script from the scan results.
.. Run the following command, using `--fix-type bash` to request a bash script with the fixes:
+
----
[... build]$ oscap xccdf generate fix --fix-type bash --result-id "" /tmp/arf.xml > bash-fix.sh
----

. Check the output :
+
----
[... build]$ open bash-fix.sh
----

The Ansible Playbook can be used to configure a system to meet a compliant state. Using Ansible Playbooks is discussed in `Lab Exercise 4`.
The Bash remediation script also can be used to change the configuration of the system.
It is recommended that you review the contents of these scripts and test them in a testing environment first, as they have the potential to make unexpected or harmful changes.
