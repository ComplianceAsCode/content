title: 'Enable Revocation Checks for Publisher Certificates'

description: |-
    To ensure that certificate revocation checks are enabled, set
    <tt>deployment.security.revocation.check</tt> to equal <tt>ALL_CERTIFICATES</tt>
    in <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Certificates may be revoked due to improper issuance, compromise of the certificate,
    and failure to adhere to policy. Therefore, any certificate found on a CRL
    should not be trusted. Permitting execution of an applet published with a
    revoked certificate may result in spoofing, malware, system modification,
    invasion of privacy, and denial of service.
