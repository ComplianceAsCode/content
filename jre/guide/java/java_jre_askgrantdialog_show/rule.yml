title: 'Oracle JRE 8 must lock the dialog enabling users to grant permissions to execute signed content from an untrusted authority'

description: |-
    To ensure that Java locks the dialog enabling users to grant permissions, set
    <tt>deployment.security.askgrantdialog.show</tt> to equal <tt>false</tt>
    in <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.
    
    To ensure the setting cannot be modified by a user, additionally set
    <tt>deployment.security.askgrantdialog.show.locked</tt>
    in <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Java applets exist both signed and unsigned. Even for signed applets, there can be many sources, 
    some of which may be purveyors of malware. Applet sources considered trusted can have their 
    information populated into the browser, enabling Java to validate applets against trusted sources. 
    Permitting execution of signed Java applets from untrusted sources may result in acquiring malware, 
    and risks system modification, invasion of privacy, or denial of service.

ocil: |-
    To verify that Java locks the dialog enabling users to grant permissions,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'deployment.security.askgrantdialog.show=false' /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should return:
    <pre>deployment.security.askgrantdialog.show=false</pre>
    
    To verify that the Java setting is locked, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'deployment.security.askgrantdialog.show.locked' /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should return:
    <pre>deployment.security.askgrantdialog.show.locked</pre>
