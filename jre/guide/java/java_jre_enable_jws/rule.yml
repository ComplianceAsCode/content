title: 'Enable Java Web Start Applications to Run'

description: |-
    To ensure that Java allows applets or Java Web Start (JWS) applications to
    run, set <tt>deployment.webjava.enabled</tt> to equal <tt>true</tt> in
    <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Due to the popularity of Java Web Start (JWS) applications, denying these
    applications could have a negative impact to the user experience. Whitelisting,
    blacklisting, and signing of applications help mitigate the risk of running
    JWS applications.

ocil: |-
    To verify that Java allows applets or Java Web Start (JWS) applications to
    run, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'deployment.webjava.enabled=true' /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should return:
    <pre>deployment.webjava.enabled=true</pre>
