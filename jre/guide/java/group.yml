title: Java

description: |-
    Java is a general-purpose computer programming language. It is intended to
    let application developers "write once, run anywhere." Java applications are
    typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM)
    regardless of computer architecture. As such, the Java runtime environment (JRE)
    is required to be installed so that Java applications can run. This section
    provides settings for configuring Java policies to meet compliance
    settings for Java running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems.
