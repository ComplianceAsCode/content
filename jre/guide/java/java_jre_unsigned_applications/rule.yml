title: 'Disable Execution of Unsigned Applications'

description: |-
    To ensure that Java does not allow unsigned applications to run, set
    <tt>deployment.security.level</tt> to equal <tt>VERY_HIGH</tt> in
    <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Unsigned applications could perform numerous types of attacks on a system.
    Applications that are signed with a valid certificate and include the
    permissions attribute in the manifest for the main JAR file are allowed to
    run with security prompts. All other applications are blocked.

severity: high

ocil_clause: 'it is not configured'

ocil: |-
    To verify that Java does not allow unsigned applications to run,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'deployment.security.level=VERY_HIGH' /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should return:
    <pre>deployment.security.level=VERY_HIGH</pre>
