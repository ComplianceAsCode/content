title: 'Oracle JRE 8 must prevent the download of prohibited mobile code'

description: |-
    To ensure that Java prevents the download of prohibited mobile code, set
    <tt>deployment.security.blacklist.check</tt> to equal <tt>true</tt>
    in <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.
    
    To ensure the setting cannot be modified by a user, additionally set
    <tt>deployment.security.blacklist.check.locked</tt>
    in <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Preventing the download of prohibited mobile code reduces the the potential 
    for the code to cause damage to the system if used maliciously.

ocil_clause: 'it does not exist or is not configured properly'

ocil: |-
    To verify that Java prevents the download of prohibited mobile code,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'deployment.security.blacklist.check=true' /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should return:
    <pre>deployment.security.blacklist.check=true</pre>
    
    To verify that the Java setting is locked, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'deployment.security.blacklist.check.locked' /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should return:
    <pre>deployment.security.blacklist.check.locked</pre>
