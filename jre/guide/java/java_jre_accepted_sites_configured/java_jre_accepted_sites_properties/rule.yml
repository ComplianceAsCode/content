title: 'Configure the Path to the exception.sites File'

description: |-
    To ensure that the accepted sites list file is set in
    <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>, add or modify
    <tt>deployment.user.security.exception.sites</tt> to equal
    <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/exception.sites</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Without a proper path for the accepted sites list file, unauthorized
    software programs are able to be executed. Using only authorized software
    decreases risk by limiting the number of potential vulnerabilities.

ocil: |-
    To verify that <tt>deployment.properties</tt> file is configured properly,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'deployment.user.security.exception.sites=' /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should return:
    <pre>deployment.user.security.exception.sites=/etc/.java/deployment/exception.sites</pre>
