title: 'Configure Java Runtime to use System Crypto Policy'

description: |-
    Crypto Policies provide a centralized control over crypto algorithms usage of many packages.
    Java is supported by crypto policy, but the Java configuration may be
    set up to ignore it.

    To check that Crypto Policies settings are configured correctly, you have to examine the JRE config file
    available under <tt>/usr/lib/jvm/jre/lib/security/java.security</tt>.
    If this config file contains the line <tt>security.useSystemPropertiesFile=true</tt>,
    settings that are part of the system-wide crypto policy take precedence.

rationale: |-
    Overriding the system crypto policy makes the behavior of the Java runtime violates expectations,
    and makes system configuration more fragmented.

severity: unknown

ocil_clause: |-
    the <pre>java.security</pre> doesn't contain the <pre>security.useSystemPropertiesFile=true</pre> line

ocil: |-
    To verify that Java uses the system crypto policy, check out that the respective JRE config file
    <pre>/usr/lib/jvm/jre/lib/security/java.security</pre> contains the <pre>security.useSystemPropertiesFile=true</pre> line:
    <pre>grep 'security.useSystemPropertiesFile=true' /usr/lib/jvm/jre/lib/security/java.security</pre>.
