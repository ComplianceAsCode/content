title: 'Disable Execution of Signed Java Applets From Untrusted Sources Setting'

description: |-
    To ensure that Java cannot execute from untrusted sources, set
    <tt>deployment.security.askgrantdialog.notinca</tt> to equal <tt>false</tt>
    in <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Permitting execution of signed Java applets from un-trusted sources may
    result in acquiring malware, and risks system modification, invasion of
    privacy, or denial of service. Block users from granting permissions to
    certificates that are not issued by a CA in the Root/JSSE CA certificate
    store.

    To verify that Java cannot execute from untrusted sources,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'askgrantdialog.notinca=false' /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should return:
    <pre>deployment.security.askgrantdialog.notinca=false</pre>
