title: 'Prevent the Download of Prohibited Mobile Code'

description: |-
    To ensure that Java prevents the download of prohibited mobile code, set
    <tt>deployment.security.blacklist.check</tt> to equal <tt>true</tt> in
    <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Mobile code has the potential to cause damage to information systems within
    an organization if used maliciously. Therefore it is important to allow vetted
    mobile code and prevent potentially malicious execution of mobile code.

    To verify that Java prevents prohibited mobile code from being downloaded,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'deployment.security.blacklist.check=true' /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should return:
    <pre>deployment.security.blacklist.check=true</pre>
