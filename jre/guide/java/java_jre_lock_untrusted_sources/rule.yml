title: 'Lock Execution of Signed Java Applets From Untrusted Sources Setting'

description: |-
    To ensure that Java cannot execute from untrusted sources, set
    <tt>deployment.security.askgrantdialog.show</tt> to equal <tt>false</tt>
    in <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Permitting execution of signed Java applets from un-trusted sources may
    result in acquiring malware, and risks system modification, invasion of
    privacy, or denial of service. Block users from granting permissions to
    applets and JWS applications.

    To verify that Java cannot execute from untrusted sources,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'askgrantdialog.show=false' /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</pre>

    <pre>deployment.security.askgrantdialog.show=false</pre>
