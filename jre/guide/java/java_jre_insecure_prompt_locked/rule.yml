title: 'Disable User Access to Insecure Prompt of Mobile Code Setting'

description: |-
    To ensure that users cannot change the mobile code setting for insecure
    prompts, add <tt>deployment.insecure.jres.locked</tt> to
    <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Mobile code has the potential to cause damage to information systems within
    an organization if used maliciously. It can execute without explicit action
    from, or notification to, a user. Requiring Java to enforce prompting the user
    prior to executing mobile code will strengthen the security posture of the
    system. As such, ensuring users cannot change the permission settings which
    control the insecure prompts for mobile code execution contributes to a more
    consistent security profile.

ocil: |-
    To verify that a user cannot change the mobile code setting for insecure
    prompts, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'deployment.insecure.jres.locked' /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should return:
    <pre>deployment.insecure.jres.locked</pre>
