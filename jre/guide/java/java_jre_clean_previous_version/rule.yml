title: 'Ensure {{{ pkg_manager }}} Removes Previous Package Versions'

description: |-
    <tt>{{{ pkg_manager }}}</tt> should be configured to remove previous versions of Java after
    new versions have been installed. To configure <tt>{{{ pkg_manager }}}</tt> to remove the
    previous versions of Java after updating, set the <tt>clean_requirements_on_remove</tt>
    to <tt>1</tt> in <tt>{{{ pkg_manager_config_file }}}</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Previous versions of software components that are not removed from the information
    system after updates have been installed may be exploited by some adversaries.
