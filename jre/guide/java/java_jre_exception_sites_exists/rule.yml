title: 'Oracle JRE 8 must have an exception.sites file present'

description: |-
    If the Java site exceptions file does not exist, it can be added by running:
    <pre>$ sudo mkdir -p -m 755 /etc/.java/deployment
    $ sudo touch /etc/.java/deployment/exception.sites
    $ sudo chmod 644 /etc/.java/deployment/exception.sites</pre>

rationale: |-
    Utilizing a whitelist provides a configuration management method for allowing the execution of only 
    authorized software. Using only authorized software decreases risk by limiting the number of potential 
    vulnerabilities.
