title: 'Disable User Access to Prohibited Mobile Code Setting'

description: |-
    To ensure that users cannot change the download of prohibited mobile code
    setting, add <tt>deployment.security.blacklist.check.locked</tt> to
    <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Mobile code has the potential to cause damage to information systems within
    an organization if used maliciously. Therefore, it is important to allow vetted
    mobile code and prevent potentially malicious execution of mobile code.
    As such, ensuring
    users cannot change the permission settings which control the downloading of
    prohibited mobile code contributes to a more consistent security profile.

ocil: |-
    To verify that a user cannot change the setting that controls the prevention of
    downloading prohibited mobile code, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'deployment.security.blacklist.check.locked' /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should return:
    <pre>deployment.security.blacklist.check.locked</pre>
