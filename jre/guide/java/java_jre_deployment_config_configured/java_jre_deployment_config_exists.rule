title: 'The Java Configuration File Exists'

description: |-
    If the Java configuration file does not exist, it can be added by running:
    <pre>$ sudo mkdir -p -m 755 /etc/.java/deployment
    $ sudo touch /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.config
    $ sudo chmod 644 /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.config</pre>

rationale: |-
    The deployment.config file is used for specifying the location and execution of
    system-level properties for the Java Runtime Environment. By default no
    deployment.config file exists; thus, no system-wide deployment.properties file exists.
    Without the deployment.config file, setting particular options for the Java
    control panel is impossible.

ocil: |-
    To verify that the <tt>deployment.config</tt> file exists,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ ls /etc/.java/deployment</pre>
    The output should contain:
    <pre>deployment.config</pre>
