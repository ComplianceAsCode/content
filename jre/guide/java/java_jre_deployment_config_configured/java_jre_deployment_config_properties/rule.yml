title: 'Configure the Path to the deployment.properties File'

description: |-
    To ensure that the Java properties file is set in
    <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.config</tt>, add or modify
    <tt>deployment.system.config</tt> to equal
    <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Without a proper path for the properties file, deployment would not be possible.
    If the path specified does not lead to a properties file, the value of the
    <tt>deployment.system.config.mandatory</tt> key determines how to handle the situation.
    If the value of this key is true, JRE will not allow Java applications to run if
    the path to the properties file is invalid.

ocil_clause: 'it is not configured'

ocil: |-
    To verify that <tt>deployment.config</tt> is configured properly,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'deployment.system.config=file' /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.config</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should return:
    <pre>deployment.system.config=file:///etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</pre>
