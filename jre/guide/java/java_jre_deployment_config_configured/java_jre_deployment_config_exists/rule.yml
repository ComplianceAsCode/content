title: 'The Java deployment.config File Exists'

description: |-
    If the Java deployment configuration file does not exist, it can be added
    by running:
    <pre>$ sudo mkdir -p -m 755 /etc/.java/deployment
    $ sudo touch /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.config
    $ sudo chmod 644 /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.config</pre>

rationale: |-
    By default no deployment.config file exists; thus, no system-wide deployment.properties file
    exists. The file must be created. The deployment.config file is used for specifying the
    location and execution of system-level properties for the Java Runtime Environment. Without
    the deployment.config file, setting particular options for the Java control panel is
    not possible.

ocil: |-
    To verify that the <tt>deployment.config</tt> file exists,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ ls /etc/.java/deployment</pre>
    The output should contain:
    <pre>deployment.config</pre>
