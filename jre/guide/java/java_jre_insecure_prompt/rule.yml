title: 'Prompt User Prior to Executing Mobile Code'

description: |-
    To ensure that Java prevents mobile code from executing without prompting
    the user, set <tt>deployment.insecure.jres</tt> to equal
    <tt>PROMPT</tt> in <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Mobile code has the potential to cause damage to information systems within
    an organization if used maliciously. It can execute without explicit action
    from, or notification to, a user. Requiring Java to enforce prompting the user prior
    to executing mobile code will strenghten the security posture of the system.

ocil: |-
    To verify that Java prevents mobile code from executing without prompting
    the user,run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'deployment.insecure.jres=PROMPT' /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should return:
    <pre>deployment.insecure.jres=PROMPT</pre>
