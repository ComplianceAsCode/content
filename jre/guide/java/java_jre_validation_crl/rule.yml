title: 'Enable Use of Certificate Revocation Lists'

description: |-
    To ensure that certificate revocation lists are enabled, set
    <tt>deployment.security.validation.crl</tt> to equal <tt>true</tt>
    in <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.

rationale: |-
    A certificate revocation list is a directory which contains a list of
    certificates that have been revoked for various reasons. Certificates may be
    revoked due to improper issuance, compromise of the certificate, and failure
    to adhere to policy. Therefore, any certificate found on a CRL should not be
    trusted. Permitting execution of an applet published with a revoked
    certificate may result in spoofing, malware, system modification, invasion
    of privacy, and denial of service.

ocil: |-
    To verify that the use of Certificate Revocation Lists are enabled, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'validation.crl=true' /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should return:
    <pre>deployment.security.validation.crl=true</pre>
