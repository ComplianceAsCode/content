title: 'Oracle JRE 8 must enable the dialog to enable users to check publisher certificates for revocation'

description: |-
    To ensure that Java enables users to check publisher certificates for revocation, set
    <tt>deployment.security.validation.crl</tt> to equal <tt>true</tt>
    in <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.
    
    To ensure the setting cannot be modified by a user, additionally set
    <tt>deployment.security.validation.crl.locked</tt>
    in <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.

rationale: |-
    A certificate revocation list is a directory which contains a list of certificates 
    that have been revoked for various reasons. Certificates may be revoked due to improper issuance, 
    compromise of the certificate, and failure to adhere to policy. Therefore, any certificate found 
    on a CRL should not be trusted. Permitting execution of an applet published with a revoked certificate 
    may result in spoofing, malware, system modification, invasion of privacy, and denial of service.

ocil: |-
    To verify that Java enables users to check publisher certificates for revocation,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'deployment.security.validation.crl=true' /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should return:
    <pre>deployment.security.validation.crl=true</pre>
    
    To verify that the Java setting is locked, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'deployment.security.validation.crl.locked' /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should return:
    <pre>deployment.security.validation.crl.locked</pre>
