title: 'Disable User Access to Unsigned Applications Setting'

description: |-
    To ensure that users cannot change the unsigned applications setting, add
    <tt>deployment.security.level.locked</tt> to
    <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Unsigned applications could perform numerous types of attacks on a system.
    As such, ensuring users cannot change the permission settings which control
    the execution of unsigned Java applications contributes to a more consistent
    security profile.

severity: high

ocil: |-
    To verify that a user cannot change the unsigned applications setting, run
    the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'deployment.security.level.locked' /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</pre>
    If properly configured,
    the output should return:
    <pre>deployment.security.level.locked</pre>
