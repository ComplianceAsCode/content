title: 'Oracle JRE 8 must default to the most secure built-in setting'

description: |-
    To ensure that Java is configured with the most secure built-in setting, set
    <tt>deployment.security.level</tt> to equal <tt>VERY_HIGH</tt>
    in <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.
    
    To ensure the setting cannot be modified by a user, additionally set
    <tt>deployment.security.level.locked</tt>
    in <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Applications that are signed with a valid certificate and include 
    the permissions attribute in the manifest for the main JAR file are 
    allowed to run with security prompts. All other applications are blocked.

ocil: |-
    To verify that Java is configured with the most secure built-in setting,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'deployment.security.level=VERY_HIGH' /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should return:
    <pre>deployment.security.level=VERY_HIGH</pre>
    
    To verify that the Java setting is locked, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'deployment.security.level.locked' /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should return:
    <pre>deployment.security.level.locked</pre>
