title: 'Oracle JRE 8 must be set to allow Java Web Start (JWS) applications'

description: |-
    To ensure that Java allows Java Web Start (JWS) applications, set
    <tt>deployment.webjava.enabled</tt> to equal <tt>true</tt>
    in <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.
    
    To ensure the setting cannot be modified by a user, additionally set
    <tt>deployment.webjava.enabled.locked</tt>
    in <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Java Web Start (JWS) applications are the most commonly used. Denying these 
    applications could be detrimental to the user experience. Whitelisting, blacklisting, 
    and signing of applications help mitigate the risk of running JWS applications.

ocil: |-
    To verify that Java allows Java Web Start (JWS) applications,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'deployment.webjava.enabled=true' /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should return:
    <pre>deployment.webjava.enabled=true</pre>
    
    To verify that the Java setting is locked, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'deployment.webjava.enabled.locked' /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should return:
    <pre>deployment.webjava.enabled.locked</pre>
