title: 'Oracle JRE 8 must set the option to enable online certificate validation'

description: |-
    To ensure that Java enables online certificate validation, set
    <tt>deployment.security.validation.ocsp</tt> to equal <tt>true</tt>
    in <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.
    
    To ensure the setting cannot be modified by a user, additionally set
    <tt>deployment.security.validation.ocsp.locked</tt>
    in <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Online certificate validation provides a real-time option to validate a certificate. 
    When enabled, if a certificate is presented, the status of the certificate is requested. 
    The status is sent back as “current”, “expired”, or “unknown”. Online certificate validation 
    provides a greater degree of validation of certificates when running a signed Java applet. 
    Permitting execution of an applet with an invalid certificate may result in malware, system 
    modification, invasion of privacy, and denial of service.

ocil: |-
    To verify that Java enables online certificate validation,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'deployment.security.validation.ocsp=true' /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should return:
    <pre>deployment.security.validation.ocsp=true</pre>
    
    To verify that the Java setting is locked, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'deployment.security.validation.ocsp.locked' /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should return:
    <pre>deployment.security.validation.ocsp.locked</pre>
