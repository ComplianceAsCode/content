title: 'Enable Online Certificate Validation'

description: |-
    To ensure that online certificate verification is enabled, set
    <tt>deployment.security.validation.ocsp</tt> to equal <tt>true</tt>
    in <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Online certificate validation provides a greater degree of validation of certificates
    when running a signed Java applet. Permitting execution of an applet with an invalid
    certificate may result in malware execution , system modification, invasion of privacy,
    and denial of service.

    To verify that online certificate verification is enabled,
    run the following command:

    <pre>deployment.security.validation.ocsp=true</pre>
