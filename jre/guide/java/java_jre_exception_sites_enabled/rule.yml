title: 'Oracle JRE 8 must enable the option to use an accepted sites list'

description: |-
    To ensure that Java enables the use of an accepted sites list, set
    <tt>deployment.user.security.exception.sites</tt> to equal <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/exception.sites</tt>
    in <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Utilizing a whitelist provides a configuration management method for allowing the execution of only 
    authorized software. Using only authorized software decreases risk by limiting the number of potential 
    vulnerabilities.

ocil_clause: 'it does not exist or is not configured properly'

ocil: |-
    To verify that Java prevents the download of prohibited mobile code,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'deployment.user.security.exception.sites' /etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</pre>
    If properly configured, the output should return:
    <pre>deployment.user.security.exception.sites=/etc/.java/deployment/exception.sites</pre>
