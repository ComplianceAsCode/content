title: 'Ensure Java Patches Installed'

description: |-
    If the system is joined to the Red Hat Network, a Red Hat Satellite Server,
    or a yum server, run the following command to install updates:
    <pre>$ sudo yum update</pre>
    If the system is not configured to use one of these sources, updates (in the form of RPM packages)
    can be manually downloaded and installed using <tt>rpm</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Running an older version of the JRE can introduce security
    vulnerabilities to the system.

ocil_clause: 'it is not updated'

ocil: |-
    If the system is joined to the Red Hat Network, a Red Hat Satellite Server, or
    a yum server which provides updates, invoking the following command will
    indicate if updates are available:
    <pre>$ sudo yum check-update</pre>
    If the system is not configured to update from one of these sources,
    run the following command to list when each package was last updated:
    <pre>$ rpm -qa -last</pre>
    Compare this to Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSA) listed at
    <weblink-macro link="https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/active/" />
    to determine if the system is missing applicable updates.
