title: 'Disable Java Execution From Untrusted Sources'

description: |-
    To ensure that Java cannot execute from untrusted sources, set
    <tt>deployment.security.askgrantdialog.notinca</tt> to equal <tt>false</tt>
    in <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Permitting execution of signed Java applets from un-trusted sources
    may result in acquiring malware, and risks system modification, invasion of
    privacy, or denial of service.
