# This file contains list of packages in the format of "daemon,pkgname" to
# create "package_pkgname_installed" OVAL 5.10 checks for.
#
# If the corresponding "package_pkgname_installed" OVAL is not standalone
# OVAL-5.10, but only a prerequisite in order to the corresponding
# "service_daemon_enabled" OVAL-5.11 to work properly, such a package
# SHOULD NOT be listed here, but rather in the 'packages_installed.csv'
# file under oval_5.11/templates directory!!!
