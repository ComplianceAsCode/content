      <description>Ensuring that /var is mounted on its own partition enables
      the setting of more restrictive mount options, which is used as temporary
      storage by many program, particularly system services such as daemons. It
      is not uncommon for the /var directory to contain world-writable
      directories, installed by other software packages.</description>
