title: 'Ensure Deployed Applications Have Restricted File Permissions'

description: |-
    Deployed applications must not be granted file permissions
    - except to those that are dedicated to the application only. These
    permissions are enforced by the Java Security Manager and the policies it
    loads at startup. These permissions can be assigned or restricted in an
    application-specific, granular manner.

rationale: |-
    Java permissions for deployed applications should be carefully restricted
    to enforce the least privilege principle. Granting unrestricted access to
    the host operating system creates a large attack vector for malicious
    users that have penetrated the JBoss server.
