title: 'Disable Hot Deployment'

description: |-
    Hot deployment should be disabled on production
    servers. Hot Deployment allows for automatic deployment of Java
    applications by simply placing Java applications into the deploy
    directory.

rationale: |-
    Hot deployments are not a recommended best practice for production
    environments. By requiring the additional step of restarting the
    JBoss server, application deployments become more deliberate and
    purposeful.
