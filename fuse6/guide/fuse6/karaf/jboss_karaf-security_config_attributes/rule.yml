title: |-
    Ensure Administrators Can Only Change Security Related
    Configuration Attributes

description: |-
    Security attributes are typically associated with internal
    data structures and configuration (e.g., application deployment, logging,
    monitoring) within the application server and are used to enable the
    implementation of access control and flow control policies, reflect special
    dissemination, handling or distribution instructions, or support other
    aspects of the organizational information security policy.

rationale: |-
    If unauthorized entities were able to change security attributes, the
    integrity and/or confidentiality of the server could be compromised.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: 'non-administrators are allowed to change security related attributes'
