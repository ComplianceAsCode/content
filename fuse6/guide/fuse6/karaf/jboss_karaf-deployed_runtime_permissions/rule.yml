title: 'Disable Runtime Permissions for Deployed Applications'

description: |-
    Deployed applications must not be granted runtime permissions.
    These permissions are enforced by the Java Security Manager and the policies
    it loads at startup. These permissions can be assigned or restricted in an
    application-specific, granular manner.

rationale: |-
    Java permissions for deployed applications should be carefully restricted
    to enforce the least privilege principle. Granting RuntimePermission to
    applications allows these applications to modify classloaders or modify
    the running security manager. Either of these actions can be used to
    elevate permissions and increase the number of potential damaging actions
    that can be taken.
