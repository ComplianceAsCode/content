title: 'Disable and Remove Clear-Text Passwords'

description: |-
    Eliminate clear-text passwords in JBoss configuration files. All
    passwords should be encrypted and all password files should have restricted
    file permissions.

rationale: |-
    Clear-text passwords are an unnecessary security vulnerability. While risk
    of exposure can be mitigated through configured permissions and file ownership,
    these methods do not completely remediate the risk.
