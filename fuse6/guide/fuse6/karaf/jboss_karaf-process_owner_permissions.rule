title: 'Ensure JBoss Process Owner Executes with Least Privilege'

description: |-
    Operating environment permissions assigned to the JBoss process
    owner should be in compliance with the principle of least privilege.

rationale: |-
    In order to reduce the potential impact of exploitation against the JBoss
    application server (and the rest of the operating environment), the JBoss process
    owner should execute with as few permissions as possible in the environment
    (if the account is not local to the operating system or is distributed across
    multiple operating systems). Failure to limit permissions can dramatically
    increase the severity of exploits against the JBoss server, such as the
    execution of arbitrary code.
