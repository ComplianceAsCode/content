title: 'Enable FIPS Compliant Modules'

description: |-
    While JBoss itself has no need to load FIPS compliant modules,
    the underlying technologies such as Java do. Utilizing only FIPS compliant
    modules decreases compatibility with applications that are not FIPS enabled.

rationale: |-
    Enabling FIPS compliant algorithms ensures that the underlying technologies
    that JBoss works through are using cryptographic modules that have been
    vetted by NIST for security, stability, and strength. Failure to utilize
    FIPS certified modules may cause the underlying technologies used by JBoss to
    utilize older, less secure algorithms. Failure to enable only FIPS compliant
    modules may also have regulatory consequences, as FIPS 140-2 requires the
    use of FIPS compliant modules by all federal agencies.
