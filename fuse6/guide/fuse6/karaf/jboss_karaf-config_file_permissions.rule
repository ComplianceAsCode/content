title: 'Ensure Only Administrators Can Modify Configuration Files'

description: |-
    Server should be protected with permission sets which allow
    only an application administrator to modify application resource
    configuration files.

rationale: |-
    An access control flaw exists if users or processes can view or modify
    data to which they should not be permitted. This could result in situations
    ranging from information disclosure to system compromise and could potentially
    result in the compromise of other systems on the network.

severity: medium
