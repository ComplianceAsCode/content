title: 'Enable CAC Card Usage for Deployed Applications'

description: |-
    JBoss applications implementing authentication should
    utilize the DoD Public Key Infrastructure. The DoD Public Key
    Infrastructure is designed to use hardware tokens such as the Common
    Access Card in conjunction with issued X.509 certificates. These tokens
    are typically protected with a PIN that unlocks access to the private
    certificate stored on the token.

rationale: |-
    Leveraging the DoD Public Key Infrastructure increases the security
    of an application because the DoD PKI raises the bar for exploitation
    of user identities. Applications that require authentication and do
    not utilize PKI must then rely on a less secure form of authentication,
    such as username and password. Additionally, current DoD guidance
    requires the use of DoD PKI over username and password.
