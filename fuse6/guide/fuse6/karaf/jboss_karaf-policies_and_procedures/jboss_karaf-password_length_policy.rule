title: 'Define Minimum and Maximum Password Length Requirement'

description: |-
    Organizations should create an authenticator management
    policy that defines minimum and maximum password sizes for user accounts
    accessing JBoss and its deployed applications.

rationale: |-
    In brute force scenarios, passwords of extended lengths increase
    password security and the length of time required to decrypt the password.
    However, there are risks associated with requiring passwords of great
    lengths, as users may take steps to circumvent policy; such as using
    repetitive passwords, writing password reminders, or writing down their
    passwords.
