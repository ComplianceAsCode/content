title: 'Document Incident Response Procedures'

description: |-
    Ensure well developed procedures exist for incident
    handling. Incidents include any events that are anomalous to the
    environment.

rationale: |-
    Planning for incidents prior to real-life scenarios increases
    incident response time and mitigates damages. Failure to
    adequately prepare, plan, and exercise for these scenarios can
    result in extensive losses.
