title: 'Access Control Policy and Procedures'

description: |-
    JBoss administrators must have access to guidance
    regarding account creation, permissions assignments, role assignments,
    etc.

rationale: |-
    A consistent, cohesive access control policy is impossible to attain
    without a well-documented access control policy and related procedures.
    Failure to do so typically results in over-assignment of access
    permissions for users and applications, stale access for users and
    applications, and other access control misconfigurations that reduce
    the effectiveness of the security policy.
