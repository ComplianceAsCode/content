title: 'Document Disaster Recovery Procedures'

description: |-
    Robust disaster recovery documentation and procedures
    should exist. This documentation should include provisions for
    the JBoss platform, deployed applications, required source code,
    and supporting applications (such as authentication stores or
    database servers).

rationale: |-
    Planning for disasters and extended outages prior to a real-life
    scenario helps mitigate losses associated with identified
    disasters. Failure to adequately prepare, plan, and exercise for
    these scenarios can result in extensive losses.
