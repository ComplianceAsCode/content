title: 'Configure LDAP To Fail Securely'

description: |-
    The server must fail securely in the event of an
    operational failure.

rationale: |-
    Fail secure is a condition achieved by the server in order to ensure
    that in the event of an operational failure, the system does not
    enter into an unsecure state where intended security properties no
    longer hold.
