title: 'Disable All Permission for Deployed Applications'

description: |-
    Deployed applications must not be granted all permissions.
    These permissions are enforced by the Java Security Manager and the policies
    it loads at startup. These permissions can be assigned or restricted in an
    application-specific, granular manner.

rationale: |-
    Java permissions for deployed applications should be carefully restricted
    to enforce the least privilege principle. Using AllPermissions is essentially
    disabling the Java security sandbox and is inadvisable in nearly every scenario.
