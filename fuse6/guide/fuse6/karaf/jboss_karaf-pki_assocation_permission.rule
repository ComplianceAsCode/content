title: 'Ensure Only Authorized Users Can Associate PKI Information'

description: |-
    Throughout the course of normal usage, authorized users of
    application servers will have the need to associate security attributes
    in the form of PKI credentials with information. The server utilizes a
    role based authentication model when managing server resources and limits
    access according to user role.

rationale: |-
    The server must ensure that only the users who are authorized to associate
    security attributes with information are allowed to do so.
