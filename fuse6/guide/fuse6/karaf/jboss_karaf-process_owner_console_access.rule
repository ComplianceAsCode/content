title: 'Deny JBoss Process Owner Console Access'

description: |-
    The JBoss process owner should not have interactive console
    login access.

rationale: |-
    In order to limit access in the event of an exploitation of the Jboss or
    one of its deployed applications, the account owning the Jboss process should
    be limited in its ability to interact with the supporting operating system
    where possible. Thus, the JBoss process owner account should not have
    interactive console access.
