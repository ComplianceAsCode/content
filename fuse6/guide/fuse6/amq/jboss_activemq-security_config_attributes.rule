title: |-
    Ensure Administrators Can Only Change Security Related Configuration
    Attributes

description: |-
    Security attributes are typically associated with internal
    data structures and configuration (e.g., application deployment, logging,
    monitoring) within the application server and are used to enable the
    implementation of access control and flow control policies, reflect
    special dissemination, handling or distribution instructions, or support
    other aspects of the organizational information security policy.

rationale: |-
    If unauthorized entities were able to change security attributes,
    the integrity and/or confidentiality of the server could be
    compromised.
