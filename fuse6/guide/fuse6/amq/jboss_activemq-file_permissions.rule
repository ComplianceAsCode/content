title: |-
    Ensure Only Administrators Can Modify Configuration
    Files

description: |-
    Server should be protected with permission sets
    which allow only an application administrator to modify
    application resource configuration files.

rationale: |-
    An access control flaw exists if users or processes can view
    or modify data to which they should not be permitted. This
    could result in situations ranging from information disclosure
    to system compromise and could potentially result in the
    compromise of other systems on the network.
