    JBoss Fuse is an open source Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)
    with an elastic footprint that supports integration beyond the data
    center. The lack of license fees and the ability to deploy JBoss Fuse
    in several different configurations advances intelligent integration to
    all facets of your business – on premise or in the Cloud.

    Apache Karaf and Fuse Fabric in a single integrated distribution. Core
    messaging is provided by Apache ActiveMQ, services framework (SOAP,
    XML/HTTP, RESTful HTTP) is provided by Apache CXF and integration
    framework is provided by Apache Camel. Apache Karaf provides a
    lightweight OSGI-based runtime container.
