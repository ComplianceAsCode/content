<title>Uncommon Network Protocols</title>
<description>The system includes support for several network
protocols which are not commonly used. Although security vulnerabilities 
in kernel networking code are not frequently
discovered, the consequences can be dramatic. Ensuring uncommon
network protocols are disabled reduces the system's risk to attacks
targeted at its implementation of those protocols.</description>
<warning>
Although these protocols are not commonly used, avoid disruption
in your network environment by ensuring they are not needed
prior to disabling them.

The AppleTalk suite of protocols is no longer in common use.  
Binding this protocol to the network stack increases the attack 
surface of the host.  Unprivileged local processes may be able 
to cause the system to dynamically load a protocol handler by 
opening a socket using the protocol.

<description>
Some systems have the ability to bridge or switch frames

can be useful in a variety of situations but, if enabled when 
not needed, has the potential to bypass network partitioning and security.
