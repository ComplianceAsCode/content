Mail servers are used to send and receive email over the network.
Mail is a very common service, and Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) are obvious
targets of network attack.
Ensure that machines are not running MTAs unnecessarily,
and configure needed MTAs as defensively as possible.
<br /><br />
Very few systems at any site should be configured to directly receive email over the
network. Users should instead use mail client programs to retrieve email
from a central server that supports protocols such as IMAP or POP3.
However, it is normal for most systems to be independently capable of sending email,
for instance so that cron jobs can report output to an administrator.
Most MTAs, including Postfix, support a submission-only mode in which mail can be sent from
the local system to a central site MTA (or directly delivered to a local account),
but the system still cannot receive mail directly over a network.
<br /><br />
The <tt>alternatives</tt> program in Red Hat Enterprise Linux permits selection of other mail server software
(such as Sendmail), but Postfix is the default and is preferred.
Postfix was coded with security in mind and can also be more effectively contained by
SELinux as its modular design has resulted in separate processes performing specific actions.
More information is available on its website, <weblink-macro link="http://www.postfix.org"/>.

<description>
Edit the file(s) <tt>/etc/aliases</tt> and <tt>/usr/lib/aliases</tt>, if either exist,

<rationale>
A common configuration for older Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) is to include an alias for 
the decode user. All mail sent to this user is sent to the uudecode program, which automatically 
converts and stores files. By sending mail to the decode or the uudecode aliases present on some 
systems, a remote attacker may be able to create or overwrite files on the remote host. This 
could possibly be used to gain remote access.
