<title>Obsolete Services</title>
<description>This section discusses a number of network-visible
services which have historically caused problems for system
security, and for which disabling or severely limiting the service
has been the best available guidance for some time. As a result of
this, many of these services are not installed as part of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
by default.
<br /><br />
Organizations which are running these services should
switch to more secure equivalents as soon as possible.
If it remains absolutely necessary to run one of
these services for legacy reasons, care should be taken to restrict
the service as much as possible, for instance by configuring host
firewall software such as <tt>iptables</tt> to restrict access to the
vulnerable service to only those remote hosts which have a known
need to use it.</description>

<Group id="inetd_and_xinetd">
<title>Xinetd</title>
<description>The <tt>xinetd</tt> service acts as a dedicated listener for some
network services (mostly, obsolete ones) and can be used to provide access
controls and perform some logging. It has been largely obsoleted by other
features, and it is not installed by default. The older Inetd service
is not even available as part of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.</description>

The xinetd service provides a dedicated listener service for some programs,
which is no longer necessary for commonly-used network services. Disabling
it ensures that these uncommon services are not running, and also prevents
attacks against xinetd itself.

<title>Telnet</title>
<description>The telnet protocol does not provide confidentiality or integrity
for information transmitted on the network. This includes authentication
information such as passwords. Organizations which use telnet should be
actively working to migrate to a more secure protocol.</description>

The telnet protocol uses unencrypted network communication, which
means that data from the login session, including passwords and
all other information transmitted during the session, can be
stolen by eavesdroppers on the network. The telnet protocol is also

TFTP is a lightweight version of the FTP protocol which has
traditionally been used to configure networking equipment. However,
TFTP provides little security, and modern versions of networking
operating systems frequently support configuration via SSH or other

secure method of supporting existing equipment can be
found.</description>
