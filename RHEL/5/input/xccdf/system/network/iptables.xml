<title>iptables and ip6tables</title>
<description>A host-based firewall called Netfilter is included as
part of the Linux kernel distributed with the system. It is
activated by default. This firewall is controlled by the program
iptables, and the entire capability is frequently referred to by
this name. An analogous program called ip6tables handles filtering
for IPv6.
<br /><br />
Unlike TCP Wrappers, which depends on the network server
program to support and respect the rules written, Netfilter
filtering occurs at the kernel level, before a program can even
process the data from the network packet. As such, any program on
the system is affected by the rules written.
<br /><br />
This section provides basic information about strengthening
the iptables and ip6tables configurations included with the system.
For more complete information that may allow the construction of a
sophisticated ruleset tailored to your environment, please consult
the references at the end of this section.</description>

<Group id="iptables_activation">
<title>Inspect and Activate Default Rules</title>
<description>View the currently-enforced iptables rules by running
the command:
<pre># iptables -nL --line-numbers</pre>
The command is analogous for the ip6tables program.
<br /><br />
If the firewall does not appear to be active (i.e., no rules
appear), activate it and ensure that it starts at boot by issuing
the following commands (and analogously for ip6tables):
<pre># service iptables restart</pre>
The default iptables rules are:
<pre>Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
num  target     prot opt source       destination
1    ACCEPT     all  --  0.0.0.0/0    0.0.0.0/0    state RELATED,ESTABLISHED 
2    ACCEPT     icmp --  0.0.0.0/0    0.0.0.0/0
3    ACCEPT     all  --  0.0.0.0/0    0.0.0.0/0
4    ACCEPT     tcp  --  0.0.0.0/0    0.0.0.0/0    state NEW tcp dpt:22 
5    REJECT     all  --  0.0.0.0/0    0.0.0.0/0    reject-with icmp-host-prohibited 

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
num  target     prot opt source       destination
1    REJECT     all  --  0.0.0.0/0    0.0.0.0/0    reject-with icmp-host-prohibited 

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
num  target     prot opt source       destination</pre>
The <tt>ip6tables</tt> default rules are essentially the same.</description>

<title>Strengthen the Default Ruleset</title>
<description>The default rules can be strengthened. The system
scripts that activate the firewall rules expect them to be defined
in the configuration files iptables and ip6tables in the directory
<tt>/etc/sysconfig</tt>. Many of the lines in these files are similar
to the command line arguments that would be provided to the programs
<tt>/sbin/iptables</tt> or <tt>/sbin/ip6tables</tt> - but some are quite
different.
<br /><br />
The following recommendations describe how to strengthen the
default ruleset configuration file. An alternative to editing this
configuration file is to create a shell script that makes calls to
the iptables program to load in rules, and then invokes service
iptables save to write those loaded rules to
<tt>/etc/sysconfig/iptables.</tt>
<br /><br />
The following alterations can be made directly to
<tt>/etc/sysconfig/iptables</tt> and <tt>/etc/sysconfig/ip6tables</tt>.
Instructions apply to both unless otherwise noted. Language and address
conventions for regular iptables are used throughout this section;
configuration for ip6tables will be either analogous or explicitly
covered.</description>
<warning category="general">The program <tt>system-config-securitylevel</tt>
allows additional services to penetrate the default firewall rules
and automatically adjusts <tt>/etc/sysconfig/iptables</tt>. This program
is only useful if the default ruleset meets your security
requirements. Otherwise, this program should not be used to make
changes to the firewall configuration because it re-writes the
saved configuration file.</warning>
