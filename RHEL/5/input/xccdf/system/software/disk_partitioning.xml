<title>Disk Partitioning</title>
<description>To ensure separation and protection of data, there
are top-level system directories which should be placed on their
own physical partition or logical volume. The installer's default
partitioning scheme creates separate logical volumes for 
<tt>/</tt>, <tt>/boot</tt>, and <tt>swap</tt>.
<ul>
<li>If starting with any of the default layouts, check the box to
"Review and modify partitioning." This allows for the easy creation
of additional logical volumes inside the volume group already
created, though it may require making <tt>/</tt>'s logical volume smaller to
create space. In general, using logical volumes is preferable to
using partitions because they can be more easily adjusted
later.</li>
<li>If creating a custom layout, create the partitions mentioned in
the previous paragraph (which the installer will require anyway),
as well as separate ones described in the following sections.</li>
</ul>
If a system has already been installed, and the default
partitioning scheme was used, it is possible but nontrivial to
modify it to create separate logical volumes for the directories
listed above. The Logical Volume Manager (LVM) makes this possible.
See the LVM HOWTO at <weblink-macro link="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/"/> for more
detailed information on LVM.</description>

<Rule id="partition_for_tmp">
<title>Ensure /tmp Located On Separate Partition</title>
<description>
The <tt>/tmp</tt> directory is a world-writable directory used
for temporary file storage. Ensure it has its own partition or
logical volume at installation time, or migrate it using LVM.
</description>
<ocil><partition-check-macro part="/tmp "/></ocil>
<rationale>
The <tt>/tmp</tt> partition is used as temporary storage by many programs.
Placing <tt>/tmp</tt> in its own partition enables the setting of more
restrictive mount options, which can help protect programs which use it.

<Rule id="partition_for_var">
<title>Ensure /var Located On Separate Partition</title>
<description>The <tt>/var</tt> directory is used by daemons and other system
services to store frequently-changing data. Ensure that <tt>/var</tt> has its own partition
or logical volume at installation time, or migrate it using LVM.
</description>
<ocil><partition-check-macro part="/var "/></ocil>
<rationale>
Ensuring that <tt>/var</tt> is mounted on its own partition enables the
setting of more restrictive mount options. This helps protect
system services such as daemons or other programs which use it.
It is not uncommon for the <tt>/var</tt> directory to contain
world-writable directories, installed by other software packages.

<Rule id="partition_for_var_log_audit">
<title>Ensure /var/log/audit Located On Separate Partition</title>
<description>
Audit logs are stored in the <tt>/var/log/audit</tt> directory.  Ensure that it
has its own partition or logical volume at installation time, or migrate it
later using LVM. Make absolutely certain that it is large enough to store all
audit logs that will be created by the auditing daemon.
</description>
<ocil><partition-check-macro part="/var/log/audit "/></ocil>
<rationale>
Placing <tt>/var/log/audit</tt> in its own partition
enables better separation between audit files
and other files, and helps ensure that
auditing cannot be halted due to the partition running out
of space.

<Rule id="partition_for_home">
<title>Ensure /home Located On Separate Partition</title>
<description>
If user home directories will be stored locally, create a separate partition
for <tt>/home</tt> at installation time (or migrate it later using LVM). If
<tt>/home</tt> will be mounted from another system such as an NFS server, then
creating a separate partition is not necessary at installation time, and the
mountpoint can instead be configured later.
</description>
<ocil><partition-check-macro part="/home "/></ocil>
<rationale>
Ensuring that <tt>/home</tt> is mounted on its own partition enables the
setting of more restrictive mount options, and also helps ensure that
users cannot trivially fill partitions used for log or audit data storage.
