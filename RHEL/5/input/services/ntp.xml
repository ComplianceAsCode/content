<title>Network Time Protocol</title>
<description>The Network Time Protocol is used to manage the system
clock over a network. Computer clocks are not very accurate, so
time will drift unpredictably on unmanaged systems. Central time
protocols can be used both to ensure that time is consistent among
a network of machines, and that their time is consistent with the
outside world.
<br /><br />
If every system on a network reliably reports the same time, then it is much
easier to correlate log messages in case of an attack. In addition, a number of
cryptographic protocols (such as Kerberos) use timestamps to prevent certain
types of attacks. If your network does not have synchronized time, these
protocols may be unreliable or even unusable.
<br /><br />
Depending on the specifics of the network, global time accuracy may be just as
important as local synchronization, or not very important at all. If your
network is connected to the Internet, using a
public timeserver (or one provided by your enterprise) provides globally
accurate timestamps which may be essential in investigating or responding to
an attack which originated outside of your network.
<br /><br />
A typical network setup involves a small number of internal systems operating as NTP
servers, and the remainder obtaining time information from those
internal servers.
<br /><br />
More information on how to configure the NTP server software,
including configuration of cryptographic authentication for
time data, is available at http://www.ntp.org.

<rationale>Enabling the <tt>ntpd</tt> service ensures that the <tt>ntpd</tt>
service will be running and that the system will synchronize its time to
any servers specified. This is important whether the system is configured to be
a client (and synchronize only its own clock) or it is also acting as an NTP
server to other systems.  Synchronizing time is essential for authentication
services such as Kerberos, but it is also important for maintaining accurate
logs and auditing possible security breaches.  
<br /><br />
The NTP daemon offers all of the functionality of <tt>ntpdate</tt>, which is now 
deprecated.  Additional information on this is available at

<Rule id="ntp_remote_server" severity="medium">
<title>Specify a Remote NTP Server</title>
<description>To specify a remote NTP server for time synchronization, edit
the file <tt>/etc/ntp.conf</tt>. Add or correct the following lines,
substituting the IP or hostname of a remote NTP server for <em>ntpserver</em>:
<pre>server <i>ntpserver</i></pre>
This instructs the NTP software to contact that remote server to obtain time
data.
</description>
<ocil clause="this is not the case">
To verify that a remote NTP service is configured for time synchronization,
open the following file:
<pre>/etc/ntp.conf</pre>
In the file, there should be a section similar to the following:
<pre>server <i>ntpserver</i></pre>
</ocil>
<rationale>Synchronizing with an NTP server makes it possible
to collate system logs from multiple sources or correlate computer events with
real time events.

<Rule id="ntp_multiple_remote_servers">
<title>Specify Additional Remote NTP Servers</title>
<description>Additional NTP servers can be specified for time synchronization
in the file <tt>/etc/ntp.conf</tt>.  To do so, add additional lines of the
following form, substituting the IP address or hostname of a remote NTP server for
<em>ntpserver</em>:
<pre>server <i>ntpserver</i></pre>
</description>
<rationale>Specifying additional NTP servers increases the availability of
accurate time data, in the event that one of the specified servers becomes
unavailable. This is typical for a system acting as an NTP server for
other systems.
