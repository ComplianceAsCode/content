<title>Disable X Windows</title>
<description>Unless there is a mission-critical reason for the
system to run a graphical user interface, ensure X is not set to start
automatically at boot and remove the X Windows software packages.
There is usually no reason to run X Windows
on a dedicated server machine, as it increases the system's attack surface and consumes
system resources. Administrators of server systems should instead login via
SSH or on the text console.</description>

<Rule id="xwindows_runlevel_setting">
<title>Disable X Windows Startup By Setting Runlevel</title>
<description>Setting the system's runlevel to 3 will prevent automatic startup
of the X server. To do so, ensure the following line in <tt>/etc/inittab</tt>
features a <tt>3</tt> as shown:
<pre>id:3:initdefault:</pre>
</description>
<ocil clause="it does not">
To verify the default runlevel is 3, run the following command:
<pre># grep initdefault /etc/inittab</pre>
The output should show the following:
<pre>id:3:initdefault:</pre>
</ocil>
<rationale>Unnecessary services should be disabled to decrease the attack surface of the system.</rationale>
