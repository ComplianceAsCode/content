<title>System Accounting with <tt>auditd</tt></title>
<description>The audit service provides substantial capabilities
for recording system activities. By default, the service audits about
SELinux AVC denials and certain types of security-relevant events
such as system logins, account modifications, and authentication
events performed by programs such as sudo.
Under its default configuration, <tt>auditd</tt> has modest disk space
requirements, and should not noticeably impact system performance.
<br /><br />
Government networks often have substantial auditing
requirements and <tt>auditd</tt> can be configured to meet these
requirements.
Examining some example audit records demonstrates how the Linux audit system
satisfies common requirements.  
The following example from Fedora Documentation available at 
<tt>http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/13/html/Security-Enhanced_Linux/sect-Security-Enhanced_Linux-Fixing_Problems-Raw_Audit_Messages.html</tt>
shows the substantial amount of information captured in a
two typical "raw" audit messages, followed by a breakdown of the most important
fields. In this example the message is SELinux-related and reports an AVC
denial (and the associated system call) that occurred when the Apache HTTP
Server attempted to access the <tt>/var/www/html/file1</tt> file (labeled with
the <tt>samba_share_t</tt> type):
<pre>type=AVC msg=audit(1226874073.147:96): avc:  denied  { getattr } for pid=2465 comm="httpd"

</ul>
</li>
<li> From the system call (<tt>SYSCALL</tt>) message, two items are of interest:
<ul><li><tt>success=no</tt>: indicates whether the denial (AVC) was enforced or not.
<tt>success=no</tt> indicates the system call was not successful (SELinux denied
access). <tt>success=yes</tt> indicates the system call was successful - this can
be seen for permissive domains or unconfined domains, such as <tt>initrc_t</tt>
and <tt>kernel_t</tt>.
</li>
<li><tt>exe="/usr/sbin/httpd"</tt>: the full path to the executable that launched

<Group id="configure_auditd_data_retention">
<title>Configure <tt>auditd</tt> Data Retention</title>
<description>
The audit system writes data to <tt>/var/log/audit/audit.log</tt>. By default,
<tt>auditd</tt> rotates 5 logs by size (6MB), retaining a maximum of 30MB of
data in total, and refuses to write entries when the disk is too
full. This minimizes the risk of audit data filling its partition
and impacting other services. This also minimizes the risk of the audit
daemon temporarily disabling the system if it cannot write audit log (which
it can be configured to do).

For a busy
system or a system which is thoroughly auditing system activity, the default settings
for data retention may be
 insufficient. The log file size needed will depend heavily on what types
of events are being audited. First configure auditing to log all the events of
interest. Then monitor the log size manually for awhile to determine what file
size will allow you to keep the required data for the correct time period.
<br/><br/>
Using a dedicated partition for <tt>/var/log/audit</tt> prevents the
<tt>auditd</tt> logs from disrupting system functionality if they fill, and,
more importantly, prevents other activity in <tt>/var</tt> from filling the
partition and stopping the audit trail. (The audit logs are size-limited and
therefore unlikely to grow without bound unless configured to do so.) Some
machines may have requirements that no actions occur which cannot be audited.
If this is the case, then <tt>auditd</tt> can be configured to halt the machine
if it runs out of space. <b>Note:</b> Since older logs are rotated,
configuring <tt>auditd</tt> this way does not prevent older logs from being
rotated away before they can be viewed.

<i>If your system is configured to halt when logging cannot be performed, make
sure this can never happen under normal circumstances! Ensure that
<tt>/var/log/audit</tt> is on its own partition, and that this partition is
larger than the maximum amount of data <tt>auditd</tt> will retain
normally.</i>

<description>The <tt>auditd</tt> program can perform comprehensive

configuration settings for comprehensive auditing, but a full
description of the auditing system's capabilities is beyond the
scope of this guide. The mailing list <i>linux-audit@redhat.com</i> exists
to facilitate community discussion of the auditing system.
<br /><br />
The audit subsystem supports extensive collection of events, including:
<br />
<ul>
<li>Tracing of arbitrary system calls (identified by name or number)
on entry or exit.</li>
<li>Filtering by PID, UID, call success, system call argument (with
some limitations), etc.</li>
<li>Monitoring of specific files for modifications to the file's
contents or metadata.</li>
</ul>
<br />
Auditing rules at startup are controlled by the file <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt>.
Add rules to it to meet the auditing requirements for your organization.
Each line in <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> represents a series of arguments
that can be passed to <tt>auditctl</tt> and can be individually tested
during runtime. See documentation in <tt>/usr/share/doc/audit-<i>VERSION</i></tt> and
in the related man pages for more details.
<br /><br />
If copying any example audit rulesets from <tt>/usr/share/doc/audit-VERSION</tt>,
be sure to comment out the
lines containing <tt>arch=</tt> which are not appropriate for your system's
architecture. Then review and understand the following rules,
ensuring rules are activated as needed for the appropriate
architecture.
<br /><br />
After reviewing all the rules, reading the following sections, and
editing as needed, the new rules can be activated as follows:

<description>At a minimum the audit system should collect file permission

calls.  Additionally, these rules can be configured in a number of ways while 
still achieving the desired effect.  An example of this is that the "-S" calls
