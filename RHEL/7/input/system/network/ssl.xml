<title>Transport Layer Security Support</title>
<description>
Support for Transport Layer Security (TLS), and its predecessor, the Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL), is included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux in the OpenSSL software (RPM package
<tt>openssl</tt>).  TLS provides encrypted and authenticated network
communications, and many network services include support for it.  TLS or SSL
can be leveraged to avoid any plaintext transmission of sensitive data.
