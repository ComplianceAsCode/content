<title>File Permissions and Masks</title>
<description>Traditional Unix security relies heavily on file and
directory permissions to prevent unauthorized users from reading or
modifying files to which they should not have access. 
<br /><br />
Several of the commands in this section search filesystems
for files or directories with certain characteristics, and are
intended to be run on every local partition on a given system.
When the variable <i>PART</i> appears in one of the commands below,
it means that the command is intended to be run repeatedly, with the
name of each local partition substituted for <i>PART</i> in turn.
<br /><br />
The following command prints a list of all ext4 partitions on the local
system, which is the default filesystem for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
6 installations:
<pre>$ mount -t ext4 | awk '{print $3}'</pre>
For any systems that use a different
local filesystem type, modify this command as appropriate.
