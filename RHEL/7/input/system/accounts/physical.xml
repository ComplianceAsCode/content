<title>Protect Physical Console Access</title>
<description>It is impossible to fully protect a system from an
attacker with physical access, so securing the space in which the
system is located should be considered a necessary step. However,
there are some steps which, if taken, make it more difficult for an
attacker to quickly or undetectably modify a system from its
console.</description>

<title>Set Boot Loader Password</title>
<description>During the boot process, the boot loader is
responsible for starting the execution of the kernel and passing
options to it. The boot loader allows for the selection of
different kernels - possibly on different partitions or media.
The default RHEL boot loader for x86 systems is called GRUB2.
Options it can pass to the kernel include <i>single-user mode</i>, which
provides root access without any authentication, and the ability to
disable SELinux. To prevent local users from modifying the boot
parameters and endangering security, protect the boot loader configuration
with a password and ensure its configuration file's permissions
are set properly.

<title>Set Boot Loader Password</title>
<description>The grub2 boot loader should have a superuser account and password
protection enabled to protect boot-time settings.
<br /><br />
To do so, select a superuser account and password and add them into the
appropriate grub2 configuration file(s) under <tt>/etc/grub.d</tt>.
Since plaintext passwords are a security risk, generate a hash for the pasword
by running the following command:
<pre>$ grub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2</pre>
When prompted, enter the password that was selected and insert the returned 
password hash into the appropriate grub2 configuration file(s) under
<tt>/etc/grub.d</tt> immediately after the superuser account.
(Use the output from <tt>grub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2</tt> as the value of 
<b>password-hash</b>):
<pre>password_pbkdf2 <b>superusers-account</b> <b>password-hash</b></pre>
NOTE: It is recommended not to use common administrator account names like root,
admin, or administrator for the grub2 superuser account. 
<br />
To meet FISMA Moderate, the bootloader superuser account and password MUST 
differ from the root account and password.
Once the superuser account and password have been added, update the 
<tt>grub.cfg</tt> file by running:
<pre>grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg</pre>
NOTE: Do NOT manually add the superuser account and password to the 
<tt>grub.cfg</tt> file as the grub2-mkconfig command overwrites this file.
</description>
<ocil clause="it does not">
To verify the boot loader superuser account and superuser account password have
been set, and the password encrypted, run the following command:
<pre>sudo grep -A1 "superusers\|password" /etc/grub2.cfg</pre>

<title>Configure Screen Locking</title>
<description>When a user must temporarily leave an account
logged-in, screen locking should be employed to prevent passersby
from abusing the account. User education and training is
particularly important for screen locking to be effective, and policies
can be implemented to reinforce this.
<br /><br />
Automatic screen locking is only meant as a safeguard for
those cases where a user forgot to lock the screen.</description>

<Group id="gui_screen_locking">
<title>Configure GUI Screen Locking</title>
<description>In the default GNOME3 desktop, the screen can be locked
by selecting the user name in the far right corner of the main panel and
selecting <b>Lock</b>.
<br /><br />
The following sections detail commands to enforce idle activation of the screensaver,
screen locking, a blank-screen screensaver, and an idle
activation time.
<br /><br />
Because users should be trained to lock the screen when they
step away from the computer, the automatic locking feature is only
meant as a backup.
<br /><br />
The root account can be screen-locked; however,
the root account should <i>never</i> be used
to log into an X Windows environment and should only be used to
for direct login via console in emergency circumstances.

configuration system, see <b>http://wiki.gnome.org/dconf</b> and
