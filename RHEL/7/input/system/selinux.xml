<title>SELinux</title>
<description>SELinux is a feature of the Linux kernel which can be
used to guard against misconfigured or compromised programs.
SELinux enforces the idea that programs should be limited in what
files they can access and what actions they can take.
<br /><br />
The default SELinux policy, as configured on RHEL 6, has been
sufficiently developed and debugged that it should be usable on
almost any Red Hat machine with minimal configuration and a small
amount of system administrator training. This policy prevents
system services - including most of the common network-visible
services such as mail servers, FTP servers, and DNS servers - from
accessing files which those services have no valid reason to
access. This action alone prevents a huge amount of possible damage
from network attacks against services, from trojaned software, and
so forth.
<br /><br />
This guide recommends that SELinux be enabled using the
default (targeted) policy on every Red Hat system, unless that
system has requirements which make a stronger policy
appropriate.

<title>Enable SELinux</title>
<description>Edit the file <tt>/etc/selinux/config</tt>. Add or correct the
following lines:
<pre>SELINUX=enforcing
SELINUXTYPE=targeted</pre>
Edit the file <tt>/etc/grub.conf</tt>. Ensure that the following
arguments DO NOT appear on any kernel command line in the file:
<pre>selinux=0
enforcing=0</pre>
The directive <tt>SELINUX=enforcing</tt> enables SELinux at boot time.
If SELinux is suspected of involvement with boot-time problems
(unlikely), it is possible to boot into the warning-only mode
<tt>SELINUX=permissive</tt> for debugging purposes. Make certain to change
the mode back to enforcing after debugging, set the filesystems to
be relabeled for consistency using the command <tt>touch
/.autorelabel</tt>, and reboot.
<br /><br />
However, the RHEL 6 default SELinux configuration should be
sufficiently reasonable that most systems will boot without serious
problems. Some applications that require deep or unusual system
privileges, such as virtual machine software, may not be compatible
with SELinux in its default configuration. However, this should be
uncommon, and SELinux's application support continues to improve.
In other cases, SELinux may reveal unusual or insecure program
behavior by design.
<br /><br />
The directive <tt>SELINUXTYPE=targeted</tt> configures SELinux to use
the default targeted policy.
<br /><br />
The SELinux boot mode specified in <tt>/etc/selinux/config</tt> can be
overridden by command-line arguments passed to the kernel. It is
necessary to check <tt>grub.conf</tt> to ensure that this has not been done
and to protect the boot process.

<description>SELinux can be disabled at boot time by an argument in

Disabling a major host protection feature, such as SELinux, at boot time prevents
it from confining system services at boot time.  Further, it increases
the chances that it will remain off during system operation.
