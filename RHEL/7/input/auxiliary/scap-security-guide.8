.SH NAME
SCAP Security Guide - Delivers security guidance, baselines, and associated validation mechanisms utilizing
the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP).


.SH DESCRIPTION
The project provides practical security hardening advice for Red Hat products,
and also links it to compliance requirements in order to ease deployment
activities, such as certification and accreditation. These include requirements
in the U.S. government (Federal, Defense, and Intelligence Community) as well
as of the financial services and health care industries. For example,
high-level and widely-accepted policies such as NIST 800-53 provides prose
stating that System Administrators must audit "privileged user actions," but do
not define what "privileged actions" are. The SSG bridges the gap between
generalized policy requirements and specific implementation guidance, in SCAP
formats to support automation whenever possible.

.SH PROFILES
The SSG content is broken into 'profiles,' groupings of security settings that correlate to a known policy. Available profiles are:

.I stig-rhel6-server
.RS
The Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) and the NSA Guides are the
configuration standards for DOD IA and IA-enabled devices/systems. Since 1998,
DISA Field Security Operations (FSO) has played a critical role enhancing the
security posture of DoD's security systems by providing the Security Technical
Implementation Guides (STIGs). This profile was created as a collaboration
effort between the National Security Agency, DISA FSO, and Red Hat.

For additional information relating to STIGs, please refer to the DISA FSO
webpage at http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/

The purpose of the United States Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB)
initiative is to create security configuration baselines for Information
Technology products widely deployed across the federal agencies. The USGCB
baseline evolved from the Federal Desktop Core Configuration mandate. The
USGCB is a Federal government-wide initiative that provides guidance to
agencies on what should be done to improve and maintain an effective
configuration settings focusing primarily on security.

.B "NOTE: "
While the current content maps to USGCB requirements, it has NOT
been validated by NIST as of yet. This content should be considered
draft, we are highly interested in feedback.

For additional information relating to USGCB, please refer to the NIST
webpage at http://usgcb.nist.gov/usgcb_content.html.

.SH EXAMPLES
To scan your system utilizing the OpenSCAP utility against the 
stig-rhel6-server profile:

oscap  xccdf eval --profile stig-rhel6-server \ 
--results /tmp/`hostname`-ssg-results.xml \
--report /tmp/`hostname`-ssg-results.html \
--cpe /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel6-cpe-dictionary.xml \
