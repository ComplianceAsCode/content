<title>Configure Dovecot if Necessary</title>
<description>If the system will operate as an IMAP or
POP3 server, the dovecot software should be configured securely by following
the recommendations below.
</description>

<Group id="dovecot_support_necessary_protocols">
<title>Support Only the Necessary Protocols</title>
<description>Dovecot supports the IMAP and POP3 protocols, as well as 
SSL-protected versions of those protocols. Configure the Dovecot server 
to support only the protocols needed by your site. Edit <tt>/etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf</tt>. 
Add or correct the following lines, replacing <tt>PROTOCOL</tt> with 
only the subset of protocols (<tt>imap</tt>, <tt>imaps</tt>, 
<tt>pop3</tt>, <tt>pop3s</tt>) required:
<pre>protocols = PROTOCOL</pre>
If possible, require SSL protection for all transactions. The SSL 
protocol variants listen on alternate ports (995 instead of 110 for 
pop3s, and 993 instead of 143 for imaps), and require SSL-aware clients. 
An alternate approach is to listen on the standard port and require the 
client to use the STARTTLS command before authenticating.

<rationale>
Configuring Dovecot to only support the protocols the protocols needed by
your site reduces the risk of an attacker using one of the unused protocols
to base an attack.</rationale>

<title>Enable SSL Support</title>
<description>SSL should be used to encrypt network traffic between the 
Dovecot server and its clients. Users must authenticate to the Dovecot 
server in order to read their mail, and passwords should never be 
transmitted in clear text. In addition, protecting mail as it is 
downloaded is a privacy measure, and clients may use SSL certificates 
to authenticate the server, preventing another system from impersonating 
the server.
