<title>Disable X Windows</title>
<description>Unless there is a mission-critical reason for the
system to run a graphical user interface, ensure X is not set to start
automatically at boot and remove the X Windows software packages.
There is usually no reason to run X Windows
on a dedicated server machine, as it increases the system's attack surface and consumes
system resources. Administrators of server systems should instead login via
SSH or on the text console.</description>

<title>Disable X Windows Startup By Setting Default Target</title>
<description>Systems that do not require a graphical user interface should only boot by default into multi-user.targ
et mode. This prevents accidental booting of the system into a graphical.target mode. This reduces the attack surf
ace of the system, and prevents nonessential services from starting at boot.Setting the system's default target to multi-user will prevent
automatic startup of the X server. To do so, run:
<pre>$ systemctl set-default multi-user.target</pre>
You should see the following output:
<pre>rm '/etc/systemd/system/default.target'
ln -s '/usr/lib/systemd/system/multi-user.target' '/etc/systemd/system/default.target'</pre>
</description>
<ocil clause="it does not">
To verify the default target is multi-user, run the following command:
<pre>$ systemctl get-default</pre>
The output should show the following:
<pre>multi-user.target</pre>
</ocil>
<rationale>Unnecessary services should be disabled to decrease the attack surface of the system.</rationale>

<title>Remove the X Windows Package Group</title>
<description>By removing the xorg-x11-server-common package,the system no longer has X Windows installed. If X Windo
ws is not installed then the system cannot boot into graphical user mode. This prevents the system from being acci
dentally or maliciously booted into a graphical.target mode.
To do so, run the following command:
<pre>$ sudo yum groupremove "X Window System"</pre>
</description>
<ocil clause="it is not">
To ensure the X Windows package group is removed, run the following command:
<pre>$ rpm -qi xorg-x11-server-common</pre>
The output should be:
<pre>package xorg-x11-server-common is not installed</pre>
</ocil>
<rationale>Unnecessary packages should not be installed to decrease the attack surface of the system.</rationale>
