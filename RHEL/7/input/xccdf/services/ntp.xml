<title>Network Time Protocol</title>
<description>The Network Time Protocol is used to manage the system
clock over a network. Computer clocks are not very accurate, so
time will drift unpredictably on unmanaged systems. Central time
protocols can be used both to ensure that time is consistent among
a network of machines, and that their time is consistent with the
outside world.
<br /><br />
If every system on a network reliably reports the same time, then it is much
easier to correlate log messages in case of an attack. In addition, a number of
cryptographic protocols (such as Kerberos) use timestamps to prevent certain
types of attacks. If your network does not have synchronized time, these
protocols may be unreliable or even unusable.
<br /><br />
Depending on the specifics of the network, global time accuracy may be just as
important as local synchronization, or not very important at all. If your
network is connected to the Internet, using a public timeserver (or one
provided by your enterprise) provides globally accurate timestamps which may be
essential in investigating or responding to an attack which originated outside
of your network.
<br /><br />
A typical network setup involves a small number of internal systems operating
as NTP servers, and the remainder obtaining time information from those
internal servers.
<br /><br />
There is a choice between the daemons <tt>ntpd</tt> and <tt>chronyd</tt>, which
are available from the repositories in the <tt>ntp</tt> and <tt>chrony</tt>
packages respectively.
<br /><br />
The default <tt>chronyd</tt> daemon can work well when external time references
are only intermittently accesible, can perform well even when the network is
congested for longer periods of time, can usually synchronize the clock faster
and with better time accuracy, and quickly adapts to sudden changes in the rate
of the clock, for example, due to changes in the temperature of the crystal
oscillator. <tt>Chronyd</tt> should be considered for all systems which are
frequently suspended or otherwise intermittently disconnected and reconnected
to a network. Mobile and virtual systems for example.
<br /><br />
The <tt>ntpd</tt> NTP daemon fully supports NTP protocol version 4 (RFC 5905),
including broadcast, multicast, manycast clients and servers, and the orphan
mode. It also supports extra authentication schemes based on public-key
cryptography (RFC 5906). The NTP daemon (<tt>ntpd</tt>) should be considered
for systems which are normally kept permanently on. Systems which are required
to use broadcast or multicast IP, or to perform authentication of packets with
the <tt>Autokey</tt> protocol, should consider using <tt>ntpd</tt>.
<br /><br />
Refer to https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/System_Administrators_Guide/ch-Configuring_NTP_Using_the_chrony_Suite.html for more detailed comparison of features of <tt>chronyd</tt>
and <tt>ntpd</tt> daemon features respectively, and for further guidance how to
choose between the two NTP daemons.
<br /><br />
The upstream manual pages at http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/manual.html for
<tt>chronyd</tt> and http://www.ntp.org for <tt>ntpd</tt> provide additional
information on the capabilities and configuration of each of the NTP daemons.

<rationale>Enabling some of <tt>chronyd</tt> or <tt>ntpd</tt> services ensures
that the NTP daemon will be running and that the system will synchronize its
time to any servers specified. This is important whether the system is
configured to be a client (and synchronize only its own clock) or it is also
acting as an NTP server to other systems.  Synchronizing time is essential for
authentication services such as Kerberos, but it is also important for
maintaining accurate logs and auditing possible security breaches.
<br /><br />
The <tt>chronyd</tt> and <tt>ntpd</tt> NTP daemons offer all of the
functionality of <tt>ntpdate</tt>, which is now deprecated. Additional

<title>Specify a Remote NTP Server</title>
<description>Depending on specific functional requirements of a concrete
production environment, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Server system can be
configured to utilize the services of the <tt>chronyd</tt> NTP daemon (the
default), or services of the <tt>ntpd</tt> NTP daemon. Refer to

further guidance how to choose between the two NTP daemons.
<br />
To specify a remote NTP server for time synchronization, perform the following:
<ul>
<li> if the system is configured to use the <tt>chronyd</tt> as the NTP daemon (the
default), edit the file <tt>/etc/chrony.conf</tt> as follows,</li>
<li> if the system is configured to use the <tt>ntpd</tt> as the NTP daemon,
edit the file <tt>/etc/ntp.conf</tt> as documented below.</li>
</ul>
Add or correct the following lines, substituting the IP or hostname of a remote
NTP server for <em>ntpserver</em>:
<pre>server <i>ntpserver</i></pre>
This instructs the NTP software to contact that remote server to obtain time
data.
</description>
<ocil clause="this is not the case">
To verify that a remote NTP service is configured for time synchronization,
open the following file:

<li><pre>/etc/ntp.conf</pre> in the case the system in question is configured
