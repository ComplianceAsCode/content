<title>DHCP</title>
<description>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) allows
systems to request and obtain an IP address and other configuration
parameters from a server.
<br /><br />
This guide recommends configuring networking on clients by manually editing
the appropriate files under <tt>/etc/sysconfig</tt>.  Use of DHCP can make client 
systems vulnerable to compromise by rogue DHCP servers, and should be avoided 
unless necessary.  If using DHCP is necessary, however, there are best practices 
that should be followed to minimize security risk.

<title>Disable DHCP Server</title>
<description>If the system must act as a DHCP server, the configuration
information it serves should be minimized. Also, support for other protocols
and DNS-updating schemes should be explicitly disabled unless needed. The
configuration file for dhcpd is called <tt>/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf</tt>. The file
begins with a number of global configuration options. The remainder of the file
is divided into sections, one for each block of addresses offered by dhcpd,
each of which contains configuration options specific to that address
block.</description>

<description>To prevent the DHCP server from receiving DNS information from
clients, edit <tt>/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf</tt>, and add or correct the following global
option: <pre>ddns-update-style none;</pre>
</description>
<rationale>The Dynamic DNS protocol is used to remotely update the data served
by a DNS server. DHCP servers can use Dynamic DNS to publish information about
their clients. This setup carries security risks, and its use is not
recommended.  If Dynamic DNS must be used despite the risks it poses, it is
critical that Dynamic DNS transactions be protected using TSIG or some other
cryptographic authentication mechanism. See dhcpd.conf(5) for more information
about protecting the DHCP server from passing along malicious DNS data from its
clients.  </rationale>
<warning category="general">The ddns-update-style option controls only whether
the DHCP server will attempt to act as a Dynamic DNS client. As long as the DNS
server itself is correctly configured to reject DDNS attempts, an incorrect
ddns-update-style setting on the client is harmless (but should be fixed as a
best practice).</warning>

<rationale>The DHCPDECLINE message can be sent by a DHCP client to indicate

DHCP is the default network configuration method provided by the system

accountability for network activity.

<description>If DHCP must be used, then certain configuration changes can

<Group id="dhcp_client_restrict_options">
<title>Minimize the DHCP-Configured Options</title>
<description>Create the file <tt>/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf</tt>, and add an
appropriate setting for each of the ten configuration settings which can be
obtained via DHCP. For each setting, do one of the following:
<br/>
If the setting should <i>not</i> be configured remotely by the DHCP server,
select an appropriate static value, and add the line:
<pre>supersede <tt>setting value</tt>;</pre>
If the setting should be configured remotely by the DHCP server, add the lines:
<pre>request <tt>setting</tt>;
require <tt>setting</tt>;</pre>
For example, suppose the DHCP server should provide only the IP address itself
and the subnet mask. Then the entire file should look like:
<pre>supersede domain-name "example.com";
supersede domain-name-servers 192.168.1.2;
supersede nis-domain "";
supersede nis-servers "";
supersede ntp-servers "ntp.example.com ";
supersede routers 192.168.1.1;
supersede time-offset -18000;
request subnet-mask;
require subnet-mask;</pre>
</description>
<rationale>By default, the DHCP client program, dhclient, requests and applies
ten configuration options (in addition to the IP address) from the DHCP server.
subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, routers, domain-name,
domain-name-servers, host-name, nis-domain, nis-servers, and ntp-servers.  Many
of the options requested and applied by dhclient may be the same for every
system on a network. It is recommended that almost all configuration options be
assigned statically, and only options which must vary on a host-by-host basis
be assigned via DHCP. This limits the damage which can be done by a rogue DHCP
server.  If appropriate for your site, it is also possible to supersede the
host-name directive in <tt>/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf</tt>, establishing a static
hostname for the machine. However, dhclient does not use the host name option
provided by the DHCP server (instead using the value provided by a reverse DNS
lookup).</rationale>
<warning category="general">In this example, the options nis-servers and
nis-domain are set to empty strings, on the assumption that the deprecated NIS
protocol is not in use. It is necessary to supersede settings for unused
services so that they cannot be set by a hostile DHCP server. If an option is
set to an empty string, dhclient will typically not attempt to configure the
service.</warning>
