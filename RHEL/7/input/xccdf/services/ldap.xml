<title>LDAP</title>
<description>LDAP is a popular directory service, that is, a
standardized way of looking up information from a central database.
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 includes software that enables a system to act as both
an LDAP client and server.

<title>Configure OpenLDAP Clients</title>
<description>This section provides information on which security settings are
important to configure in OpenLDAP clients by manually editing the appropriate
configuration files.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 provides an automated configuration tool called
authconfig and a graphical wrapper for authconfig called
<tt>system-config-authentication</tt>. However, these tools do not provide as
much control over configuration as manual editing of configuration files. The
authconfig tools do not allow you to specify locations of SSL certificate
files, which is useful when trying to use SSL cleanly across several protocols.
Installation and configuration of OpenLDAP on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is available at
https://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/System_Administrators_Guide/ch-Directory_Servers.html.

<description>This section details some security-relevant settings
for an OpenLDAP server.  Installation and configuration of OpenLDAP on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is available at:

<Rule id="package_openldap-servers_removed">
<title>Uninstall openldap-servers Package</title>
<description>The <tt>openldap-servers</tt> package should be removed if not in use.
Is this machine the OpenLDAP server? If not, remove the package.
<pre>$ sudo yum erase openldap-servers</pre>
The openldap-servers RPM is not installed by default on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7
machines. It is needed only by the OpenLDAP server, not by the
clients which use LDAP for authentication. If the system is not
intended for use as an LDAP Server it should be removed.
</description>
<ocil clause="it does not">
To verify the <tt>openldap-servers</tt> package is not installed, 
run the following command:
<pre>$ rpm -q openldap-servers</pre>
The output should show the following:
<pre>package openldap-servers is not installed</pre>
</ocil>
<rationale>Unnecessary packages should not be installed to decrease the attack
surface of the system.  While this software is clearly essential on an LDAP
server, it is not necessary on typical desktop or workstation systems.

<Group id="ldap_server_config_certificate_files">
<title>Install and Protect LDAP Certificate Files</title>
<description>Create the PKI directory for LDAP certificates if it does not already exist:
<pre>$ sudo mkdir /etc/pki/tls/ldap
$ sudo chown root:root /etc/pki/tls/ldap
$ sudo chmod 755 /etc/pki/tls/ldap</pre>
Using removable media or some other secure transmission format, install the certificate files
onto the LDAP server:
<ul>
<li><tt>/etc/pki/tls/ldap/serverkey.pem</tt>: the private key <tt>ldapserverkey.pem</tt></li>
<li><tt>/etc/pki/tls/ldap/servercert.pem</tt>: the certificate file <tt>ldapservercert.pem</tt></li>
</ul>
Verify the ownership and permissions of these files:
<pre>$ sudo chown root:ldap /etc/pki/tls/ldap/serverkey.pem
$ sudo chown root:ldap /etc/pki/tls/ldap/servercert.pem
$ sudo chmod 640 /etc/pki/tls/ldap/serverkey.pem
$ sudo chmod 640 /etc/pki/tls/ldap/servercert.pem</pre>
Verify that the CA's public certificate file has been installed as
<tt>/etc/pki/tls/CA/cacert.pem</tt>, and has the correct permissions:
<pre>$ sudo mkdir /etc/pki/tls/CA
$ sudo chown root:root /etc/pki/tls/CA/cacert.pem
$ sudo chmod 644 /etc/pki/tls/CA/cacert.pem</pre>

As a result of these steps, the LDAP server will have access to its own private
certificate and the key with which that certificate is encrypted, and to the
public certificate file belonging to the CA. Note that it would be possible for
the key to be protected further, so that processes running as ldap could not
read it. If this were done, the LDAP server process would need to be restarted
manually whenever the server rebooted.
