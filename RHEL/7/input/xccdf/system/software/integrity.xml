<title>Software Integrity Checking</title>
<description>
Both the AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment)
software and the RPM package management system provide
mechanisms for verifying the integrity of installed software.
AIDE uses snapshots of file metadata (such as hashes) and compares these
to current system files in order to detect changes.
The RPM package management system can conduct integrity
checks by comparing information in its metadata database with
files installed on the system.
<br /><br />
Integrity checking cannot <i>prevent</i> intrusions,
but can detect that they have occurred. Requirements
for software integrity checking may be highly dependent on
the environment in which the system will be used. Snapshot-based
approaches such as AIDE may induce considerable overhead
in the presence of frequent software updates.

<tt>/etc/sysconfig/prelink</tt>:

Next, run the following command to return binaries to a normal, non-prelinked state:

Verify that the file permissions, ownership, and gruop membership of system files

Output indicates files that do not match vendor defaults. After locating a file with incorrect permissions, run the following command to determine which package owns it:

<description>Without cryptographic integrity protections, system
executables and files can be altered by unauthorized users without

The RPM package management system can check the hashes of
installed software packages, including many that are important to system
security. 

To verify that the cryptographic hash of system files and commands match vendor

have hashes that differ from what is expected by the RPM database:
<pre>$ rpm -Va | grep '^..5'</pre>

A "c" in the second column indicates that a file is a configuration file, which
may appropriately be expected to change.  If the file was not expected to
change, investigate the cause of the change using audit logs or other means.
The package can then be reinstalled to restore the file.

Run the following command to determine which package owns the file:
<pre>$ rpm -qf <i>FILENAME</i></pre>

The package can be reinstalled from a yum repository using the command:
<pre>$ sudo yum reinstall <i>PACKAGENAME</i></pre>

Alternatively, the package can be reinstalled from trusted media using the command:
