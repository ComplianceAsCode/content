<title>GNOME Desktop Environment</title>
<description>
GNOME is a graphical desktop environment bundled with many Linux distributions that
allow users to easily interact with the operating system graphically rather than
textually. The GNOME Graphical Display Manager (GDM) provides login, logout, and user
switching contexts as well as display server management.
<br/><br/>
GNOME is developed by the GNOME Project and is considered the default
Red Hat Graphical environment.

By default, DConf provides a standard user profile. This profile contains a list
of DConf configuration databases. The user profile and database always take the
highest priority. As such the DConf User profile should always exist and be
configured correctly. 
<br /><br />
To make sure that the user profile is configured correctly, the <tt>/etc/dconf/profile/user</tt> should be set as follows:
<pre>user-db:user
system-db:local
system-db:site
system-db:distro
</pre>
</description>
<ocil clause="DConf User profile does not exist or is not configured correctly">
To verify that the DConf User profile is configured correctly, run the following

<pre>user-db:user

Failure to have a functional DConf profile prevents GNOME3 configuration settings

Once the settings have been added, add a lock to
