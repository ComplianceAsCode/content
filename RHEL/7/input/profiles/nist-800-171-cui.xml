<description override="true">From NIST 800-171, Section 2.2:
Security requirements for protecting the confidentiality of CUI in nonfederal 
information systems and organizations have a well-defined structure that 
consists of:

(i) a basic security requirements section;
(ii) a derived security requirements section.

The basic security requirements are obtained from FIPS Publication 200, which
provides the high-level and fundamental security requirements for federal
information and information systems. The derived security requirements, which
supplement the basic security requirements, are taken from the security controls
in NIST Special Publication 800-53.

This profile configures Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 to the NIST Special
Publication 800-53 controls identified for securing Controlled Unclassified
Information (CUI).
