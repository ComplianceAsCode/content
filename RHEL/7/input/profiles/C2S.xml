<title>C2S for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7</title>
<description>This profile demonstrates compliance against the
U.S. Government Commercial Cloud Services (C2S) baseline.

This baseline was inspired by the Center for Internet Security
(CIS) Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Benchmark, v2.1.0 - 06-02-2016.
For the SCAP Security Guide project to remain in compliance with
CIS' terms and conditions, specifically Restrictions(8), note
there is no representation or claim that the C2S profile will
ensure a system is in compliance or consistency with the CIS
baseline.
