This file is meant to give a quick overview to some of the 
scripts located in this directory.

verify-input-sanity.py
	Purpose:
		This script can be invoked without arguments to examine the 
		files within src/input to make sure that they are in good 
		shape *prior to* building the XCCDF and OVAL content with the 
		various make commands.
	Intent:
		Help XCCDF and OVAL developers spot common mistakes *before*
		utilizing the Makefile to build the XCCDF and OVAL content.
	Usage:
		./verify-input-sanity.py

verify-references.py
	Purpose:
		This script can be used to perform various checks on the XCCDF
		and OVAL that is generated by the Makefile. Unlike the
		verify-input-sanity.py script, this script limits its focus to
		the files in the src/output directory. This script is to be
		used as a development tool to aid in the creation of concise
		and structurally correct XCCDF and OVAL. 
	Intent:
		Help XCCDF and OVAL developers spot potential mistakes in the
		XCCDF and OVAL content that is generated by the Makefile.
	Usage:
		The script assumes that your current working directory is
		src/output so if you are currently in the transforms directory:

		cd ../output
		../transforms/verify-references.py --all-checks ./rhel7-xccdf.xml

		You may find this informative as well:

		./verify-references.py -h
