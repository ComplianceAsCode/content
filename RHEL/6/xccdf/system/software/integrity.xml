<title>Software Integrity Checking</title>
<description>
Both the AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment)
software and the RPM package management system provide
mechanisms for verifying the integrity of installed software.
AIDE uses snapshots of file metadata (such as hashes) and compares these
to current system files in order to detect changes.
The RPM package management system can conduct integrity
checks by comparing information in its metadata database with
files installed on the system.
<br /><br />
Integrity checking cannot <i>prevent</i> intrusions,
but can detect that they have occurred. Requirements
for software integrity checking may be highly dependent on
the environment in which the system will be used. Snapshot-based
approaches such as AIDE may induce considerable overhead
in the presence of frequent software updates.

<Rule id="disable_prelink">
<title>Disable Prelinking</title>
<description>
The prelinking feature changes binaries in an attempt to decrease their startup
time.  In order to disable it, change or add the following line inside the file
<tt>/etc/sysconfig/prelink</tt>:
<pre>PRELINKING=no</pre>
Next, run the following command to return binaries to a normal, non-prelinked state:
<pre>$ sudo /usr/sbin/prelink -ua</pre>
</description>
<rationale>
Because the prelinking feature changes binaries, it can interfere with the
operation of certain software and/or modes such as AIDE, FIPS, etc.

The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) is a computer security standard which

adequate coverage of different industries, implementation of cryptographic modules, and
organizational sizes and requirements.
<br /><br />
FIPS 140-2 is the current standard for validating that mechanisms used to access cryptographic modules
utilize authentication that meets industry and government requirements. For government systems, this allows
Security Levels 1, 2, 3, or 4 for use on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
