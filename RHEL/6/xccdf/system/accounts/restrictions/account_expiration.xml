<title>Set Account Expiration Parameters</title>
<description>Accounts can be configured to be automatically disabled
after a certain time period,
meaning that they will require administrator interaction to become usable again.
Expiration of accounts after inactivity can be set for all accounts by default
and also on a per-account basis, such as for accounts that are known to be temporary.
To configure automatic expiration of an account following
the expiration of its password (that is, after the password has expired and not been changed),
run the following command, substituting <tt><i>NUM_DAYS</i></tt> and <tt><i>USER</i></tt> appropriately:
<pre>$ sudo chage -I <i>NUM_DAYS USER</i></pre>
Accounts, such as temporary accounts, can also be configured to expire on an explicitly-set date with the
<tt>-E</tt> option.
The file <tt>/etc/default/useradd</tt> controls
default settings for all newly-created accounts created with the system's
normal command line utilities.

<title>Set Account Expiration Following Inactivity</title>
<description>To specify the number of days after a password expires (which
signifies inactivity) until an account is permanently disabled, add or correct
the following lines in <tt>/etc/default/useradd</tt>, substituting
<tt><i>NUM_DAYS</i></tt> appropriately:
<pre>INACTIVE=<i><sub idref="account_disable_post_pw_expiration"/></i></pre>
A value of 35 is recommended.  
If a password is currently on the
verge of expiration, then 35 days remain until the account is automatically
disabled. However, if the password will not expire for another 60 days, then 95
days could elapse until the account would be automatically disabled. See the
<tt>useradd</tt> man page for more information.  Determining the inactivity
timeout must be done with careful consideration of the length of a "normal"
period of inactivity for users in the particular environment. Setting
the timeout too low incurs support costs and also has the potential to impact
availability of the system to legitimate users.

<ocil clause="it does not">
To verify the <tt>INACTIVE</tt> setting, run the following command:
<pre>grep "INACTIVE" /etc/default/useradd</pre>
The output should indicate the <tt>INACTIVE</tt> configuration option is set
to an appropriate integer as shown in the example below:
<pre>$ sudo grep "INACTIVE" /etc/default/useradd
INACTIVE=<sub idref="account_disable_post_pw_expiration"/></pre></ocil>
<rationale>
Disabling inactive accounts ensures that accounts which may not
have been responsibly removed are not available to attackers
who may have compromised their credentials.

<title>Assign Expiration Date to Temporary Accounts</title>
<description>
In the event temporary or emergency accounts are required, configure the system
to terminate them after a documented time period. For every temporary and
emergency account, run the following command to set an expiration date on it,
substituting <tt><i>USER</i></tt> and <tt><i>YYYY-MM-DD</i></tt> appropriately:
<pre>$ sudo chage -E <i>YYYY-MM-DD USER</i></pre>
<tt><i>YYYY-MM-DD</i></tt> indicates the documented expiration date for the account.
</description>
<ocil clause="any temporary or emergency accounts have no expiration date set or do not expire within a documented time frame">
For every temporary and emergency account, run the following command
to obtain its account aging and expiration information:
<pre>$ sudo chage -l <i>USER</i></pre>
Verify each of these accounts has an expiration date set as documented.
</ocil>
<rationale>
When temporary and emergency accounts are created, there is a risk they may
remain in place and active after the need for them no longer exists.  Account
expiration greatly reduces the risk of accounts being misused or hijacked.
