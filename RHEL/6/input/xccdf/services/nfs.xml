<title>NFS and RPC</title>
<description>The Network File System is a popular distributed filesystem for
the Unix environment, and is very widely deployed.  This section discusses the
circumstances under which it is possible to disable NFS and its dependencies,
and then details steps which should be taken to secure
NFS's configuration. This section is relevant to systems operating as NFS
clients, as well as to those operating as NFS servers.

<description>If NFS must be used, it should be deployed in the simplest
configuration possible to avoid maintainability problems which may lead to
unnecessary security exposure. Due to the reliability and security problems
caused by NFS (specially NFSv3 and NFSv2), it is not a good idea for systems
which act as NFS servers to also mount filesystems via NFS. At the least,
crossed mounts (the situation in which each of two servers mounts a filesystem
from the other) should never be used.

<Group id="nfs_configure_fixed_ports">
<title>Configure NFS Services to Use Fixed Ports (NFSv3 and NFSv2)</title>
<description>Firewalling should be done at each host and at the border
firewalls to protect the NFS daemons from remote access, since NFS servers
should never be accessible from outside the organization. However, by default
for NFSv3 and NFSv2, the RPC Bind service assigns each NFS service to a port
dynamically at service startup time. Dynamic ports cannot be protected by port
filtering firewalls such as iptables.
<br /><br />
Therefore, restrict each service to always use a given port, so that
firewalling can be done effectively. Note that, because of the way RPC is
implemented, it is not possible to disable the RPC Bind service even if ports
are assigned statically to all RPC services.
<br /><br />
In NFSv4, the mounting and locking protocols have been incorporated into the
protocol, and the server listens on the the well-known TCP port 2049. As such,
NFSv4 does not need to interact with the <tt>rpcbind, lockd, and rpc.statd</tt>
daemons, which can and should be disabled in a pure NFSv4 environment. The
<tt>rpc.mountd</tt> daemon is still required on the NFS server to setup
exports, but is not involved in any over-the-wire operations.
