<title>Proxy Server</title>
<description>A proxy server is a very desirable target for a
potential adversary because much (or all) sensitive data for a
given infrastructure may flow through it. Therefore, if one is
required, the machine acting as a proxy server should be dedicated
to that purpose alone and be stored in a physically secure
location. The system's default proxy server software is Squid, and
provided in an RPM package of the same name.</description>

<description>If Squid was installed and activated, but the system
does not need to act as a proxy server, then it should be disabled
and removed.
