<title>FTP Server</title>
<description>FTP is a common method for allowing remote access to
files. Like telnet, the FTP protocol is unencrypted, which means
that passwords and other data transmitted during the session can be
captured and that the session is vulnerable to hijacking.
Therefore, running the FTP server software is not recommended.
<br /><br />
However, there are some FTP server configurations which may
be appropriate for some environments, particularly those which
allow only read-only anonymous access as a means of downloading
data available to the public.</description>

these logins as much as possible.</description>

</description>
<rationale>Historically, the file <tt>/etc/ftpusers</tt> contained a list of users who were not allowed to access the system via FTP. It was used to prevent system users such as the root user from logging in via the insecure FTP protocol. However, when the configuration option <tt>userlist deny=NO</tt> is set, vsftpd interprets ftpusers as the set of users who are allowed to login via FTP. Since it should be possible for most users to access their accounts via secure protocols, it is recommended that this setting be used, so that non-anonymous FTP access can be limited to legacy users who have been explicitly identified.</rationale>

<rationale>Anonymous FTP can be a convenient way to make files available for universal download. However, it is less
common to have a need to allow unauthenticated users to place files on the FTP server. If this must be done, it
is necessary to ensure that files cannot be uploaded and downloaded from the same directory.

FTP is an older protocol which is not very compatible with firewalls. During the initial FTP dialogue, the client

iptables to listen to that dialogue and allow connections to the data ports which FTP negotiates. This allows an
