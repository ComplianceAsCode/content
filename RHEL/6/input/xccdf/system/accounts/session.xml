<title>Secure Session Configuration Files for Login Accounts</title>
<description>When a user logs into a Unix account, the system
configures the user's session by reading a number of files. Many of
these files are located in the user's home directory, and may have
weak permissions as a result of user error or misconfiguration. If
an attacker can modify or even read certain types of account
configuration information, they can often gain full access to the
affected user's account. Therefore, it is important to test and
correct configuration file permissions for interactive accounts,
particularly those of privileged users such as root or system
administrators.</description>

Limiting the number of allowed users and sessions per user can limit risks related to Denial of

<title>Ensure that No Dangerous Directories Exist in Root's Path</title>
<description>The active path of the root account can be obtained by
starting a new root shell and running:
<pre>$ sudo echo $PATH</pre>
This will produce a colon-separated list of
directories in the path.
<br /><br />
Certain path elements could be considered dangerous, as they could lead
to root executing unknown or
untrusted programs, which could contain malicious
code.
Since root may sometimes work inside
untrusted directories, the <tt>.</tt> character, which represents the
current directory, should never be in the root path, nor should any
directory which can be written to by an unprivileged or
semi-privileged (system) user.
<br /><br />
It is a good practice for administrators to always execute
privileged commands by typing the full path to the
command.</description>

Also ensure that there are no "empty" elements in the path, such as in these examples:

PATH=/bin::/sbin</pre>
These empty elements have the same effect as a single <tt>.</tt> character.

<Group id="user_umask">
<title>Ensure that Users Have Sensible Umask Values</title>
<description>
The umask setting controls the default permissions
for the creation of new files.
With a default <tt>umask</tt> setting of 077, files and directories
created by users will not be readable by any other user on the
system. Users who wish to make specific files group- or
world-readable can accomplish this by using the chmod command.
Additionally, users can make all their files readable to their
group by default by setting a <tt>umask</tt> of 027 in their shell
configuration files. If default per-user groups exist (that is, if
every user has a default group whose name is the same as that
user's username and whose only member is the user), then it may
even be safe for users to select a <tt>umask</tt> of 007, making it very
easy to intentionally share files with groups of which the user is
a member.
<br /><br />
<!--In addition, it may be necessary to change root's <tt>umask</tt>
temporarily in order to install software or files which must be
readable by other users, or to change the default umasks of certain
service accounts such as the FTP user. However, setting a
restrictive default protects the files of users who have not taken
steps to make their files more available, and preventing files from
being inadvertently shared.-->

<!-- Define a new catch-all Rule?
<li>View the additional configuration files <tt>/etc/csh.login</tt> and
<tt>/etc/profile.d/*</tt>, and ensure that none of these files redefine the
umask to a more permissive value unless there is a good reason for
it.

It seems unlikely to ever be misconfigured.
Edit the root shell configuration files <tt>/root/.bashrc</tt>,
