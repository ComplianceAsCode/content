<title>SELinux</title>
<description>SELinux is a feature of the Linux kernel which can be
used to guard against misconfigured or compromised programs.
SELinux enforces the idea that programs should be limited in what
files they can access and what actions they can take.
<br /><br />
The default SELinux policy, as configured on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, has been
sufficiently developed and debugged that it should be usable on
almost any Red Hat machine with minimal configuration and a small
amount of system administrator training. This policy prevents
system services - including most of the common network-visible
services such as mail servers, FTP servers, and DNS servers - from
accessing files which those services have no valid reason to
access. This action alone prevents a huge amount of possible damage
from network attacks against services, from trojaned software, and
so forth.
<br /><br />
This guide recommends that SELinux be enabled using the
default (targeted) policy on every Red Hat system, unless that
system has unusual requirements which make a stronger policy
appropriate.

<title>Ensure SELinux Not Disabled in /etc/grub.conf</title>
<description>SELinux can be disabled at boot time by an argument in

Remove any instances of <tt>selinux=0</tt> from the kernel arguments in that
file to prevent SELinux from being disabled at boot.

<ocil clause="SELinux is disabled at boot time">
Inspect <tt>/etc/grub.conf</tt> for any instances of <tt>selinux=0</tt>

that SELinux is disabled at boot time.

<rationale>
Disabling a major host protection feature, such as SELinux, at boot time prevents
it from confining system services at boot time.  Further, it increases
the chances that it will remain off during system operation.

<title>Configure SELinux Policy</title>
<description>The SELinux <tt>targeted</tt> policy is appropriate for
general-purpose desktops and servers, as well as systems in many other roles.
To configure the system to use this policy, add or correct the following line
in <tt>/etc/selinux/config</tt>:
<pre>SELINUXTYPE=<sub idref="var_selinux_policy_name" /></pre>
Other policies, such as <tt>mls</tt>, provide additional security labeling

use cases.

Setting the SELinux policy to <tt>targeted</tt> or a more specialized policy
ensures the system will confine processes that are likely to be
targeted for exploitation, such as network or system services.

Note: During the development or debugging of SELinux modules, it is common to 
temporarily place non-production systems in <tt>permissive</tt> mode. In such 
temporary cases, SELinux policies should be developed, and once work
is completed, the system should be reconfigured to
<tt><sub idref="var_selinux_policy_name" /></tt>.

Daemons for which the SELinux policy does not contain rules will inherit the
