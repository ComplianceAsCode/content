<title>Restrict Partition Mount Options</title>
<description>System partitions can be mounted with certain options
that limit what files on those partitions can do. These options
are set in the <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> configuration file, and can be
used to make certain types of malicious behavior more difficult.</description>
