<title>Protect Random-Number Entropy Pool</title>
<description>
The I/O operations of the Linux kernel block layer due to their inherently
unpredictable execution times have been traditionally considered as a reliable
source to contribute to random-number entropy pool of the Linux kernel. This
has changed with introduction of solid-state storage devices (SSDs) though.

<title>Ensure Solid State Drives Do Not Contribute To Random-Number Entropy Pool</title>
<description>For each solid-state drive on the system, run:
<pre> # echo 0 > /sys/block/DRIVE/queue/add_random</pre>
</description>
<rationale>
In contrast to traditional electromechanical magnetic disks, containing
spinning disks and / or movable read / write heads, the solid-state storage
devices (SSDs) do not contain moving / mechanical components. Therefore the
I/O operation completion times are much more predictable for them.</rationale>
