<title override="true">Upstream STIG for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Server Running GUIs</title>
<description override="true">This profile is developed under the DoD consensus model and DISA FSO Vendor STIG process,
serving as the upstream development environment for the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Server STIG.

As a result of the upstream/downstream relationship between the SCAP Security Guide project 
and the official DISA FSO STIG baseline, users should expect variance between SSG and DISA FSO content.
For official DISA FSO STIG content, refer to http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/os/unix-linux/Pages/red-hat.aspx.

While this profile is packaged by Red Hat as part of the SCAP Security Guide package, please note 
that commercial support of this SCAP content is NOT available. This profile is provided as example 
SCAP content with no endorsement for suitability or production readiness. Support for this 
profile is provided by the upstream SCAP Security Guide community on a best-effort basis. The
upstream project homepage is https://fedorahosted.org/scap-security-guide/.
