<title>Network Configuration and Firewalls</title>
<description>Most machines must be connected to a network of some
sort, and this brings with it the substantial risk of network
attack. This section discusses the security impact of decisions
about networking which must be made when configuring a system.
<br /><br />
This section also discusses firewalls, network access
controls, and other network security frameworks, which allow
system-level rules to be written that can limit an attackers' ability
to connect to your system. These rules can specify that network
traffic should be allowed or denied from certain IP addresses,
hosts, and networks. The rules can also specify which of the
system's network services are available to particular hosts or
networks.</description>

<Group id="network_disable_unused_interfaces">
<title>Disable Unused Interfaces</title>
<description>Network interfaces expand the attack surface of the 
system.  Unused interfaces are not monitored or controlled, and 
should be disabled.
<br /><br />
If the system does not require network communications but still
needs to use the loopback interface, remove all files of the form
<tt>ifcfg-<i>interface</i></tt> except for <tt>ifcfg-lo</tt> from
<tt>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts</tt>:
<pre># rm /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<i>interface</i></pre>
If the system is a standalone machine with no need for network access or even
communication over the loopback device, then disable this service.

<Rule id="network_disable_zeroconf">
<title>Disable Zeroconf Networking</title>
<description>Zeroconf networking allows the system to assign itself an IP
address and engage in IP communication without a statically-assigned address or
even a DHCP server. Automatic address assignment via Zeroconf (or DHCP) is not
recommended. To disable Zeroconf automatic route assignment in the 169.254.0.0
subnet, add or correct the following line in <tt>/etc/sysconfig/network</tt>:
<pre>NOZEROCONF=yes</pre>
</description>
<rationale>Zeroconf addresses are in the network 169.254.0.0. The networking
scripts add entries to the system's routing table for these addresses. Zeroconf
address assignment commonly occurs when the system is configured to use DHCP
but fails to receive an address assignment from the DHCP server.

<Rule id="network_sniffer_disabled">
<title>Ensure System is Not Acting as a Network Sniffer</title>
<description>The system should not be acting as a network sniffer, which can
capture all traffic on the network to which it is connected. Run the following
to determine if any interface is running in promiscuous mode:
<pre>$ ip link | grep PROMISC</pre>
</description>
<rationale>If any results are returned, then a sniffing process (such as tcpdump
or Wireshark) is likely to be using the interface and this should be
investigated.
