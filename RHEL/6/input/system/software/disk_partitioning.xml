<title>Disk Partitioning</title>
<description>To ensure separation and protection of data, there
are top-level system directories which should be placed on their
own physical partition or logical volume. The installer's default
partitioning scheme creates separate logical volumes for 
<tt>/</tt>, <tt>/boot</tt>, and <tt>swap</tt>.
<ul>
<li>If starting with any of the default layouts, check the box to
"Review and modify partitioning." This allows for the easy creation
of additional logical volumes inside the volume group already
created, though it may require making <tt>/</tt>'s logical volume smaller to
create space. In general, using logical volumes is preferable to
using partitions because they can be more easily adjusted
later.</li>
<li>If creating a custom layout, create the partitions mentioned in
the previous paragraph (which the installer will require anyway),
as well as separate ones described in the following sections.</li>
</ul>
If a system has already been installed, and the default
partitioning scheme was used, it is possible but nontrivial to
modify it to create separate logical volumes for the directories
listed above. The Logical Volume Manager (LVM) makes this possible.
See the LVM HOWTO at http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/ for more
detailed information on LVM.</description>

If user home directories will be stored locally, create a separate partition

<tt>/home</tt> will be mounted from another system such as an NFS server, then
creating a separate partition is not necessary at installation time, and the
mountpoint can instead be configured later.

<title>Encrypt Partitions</title>
<description>
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 natively supports partition encryption through the
Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to 
encrypt a partition is during installation time.
<br /><br />
For manual installations, select the <tt>Encrypt</tt> checkbox during
partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this
option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in
decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually
every time the system boots.
<br /><br />
For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding
the <tt>--encrypted</tt> and <tt>--passphrase=</tt> options to the definition of each partition to be
encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition:
<pre>part / --fstype=ext3 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=<i>PASSPHRASE</i></pre>
Any <i>PASSPHRASE</i> is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart must then be protected accordingly.
Omitting the <tt>--passphrase=</tt> option from the partition definition will cause the
installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.
<br /><br />
Detailed information on encrypting partitions using LUKS can be found on
the Red Hat Documentation web site:<br />

Determine if encryption must be used to protect data on the system.

<rationale>
The risk of a system's physical compromise, particularly mobile systems such as
laptops, places its data at risk of compromise.  Encrypting this data mitigates
the risk of its loss if the system is lost.
