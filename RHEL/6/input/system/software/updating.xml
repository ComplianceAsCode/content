<title>Updating Software</title>
<description>The <tt>yum</tt> command line tool is used to install and
update software packages. The system also provides a graphical
software update tool in the <b>System</b> menu, in the <b>Administration</b> submenu,
called <b>Software Update</b>.
<br /><br />
Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems contain an installed software catalog called
the RPM database, which records metadata of installed packages. Consistently using
<tt>yum</tt> or the graphical <b>Software Update</b> for all software installation
allows for insight into the current inventory of installed software on the system.

<title>Ensure Red Hat GPG Key Installed</title>
<description>
To ensure the system can cryptographically verify base software
packages come from Red Hat (and to connect to the Red Hat Network to
receive them), the Red Hat GPG key must properly be installed.  
To install the Red Hat GPG key, run:
<pre># rhn_register</pre>
If the system is not connected to the Internet or an RHN Satellite,
then install the Red Hat GPG key from trusted media such as
the Red Hat installation CD-ROM or DVD. Assuming the disc is mounted
in <tt>/media/cdrom</tt>, use the following command as the root user to import
it into the keyring:
<pre># rpm --import /media/cdrom/RPM-GPG-KEY</pre>
</description>
<ocil clause="the Red Hat GPG Key is not installed">
To ensure that the GPG key is installed, run:
<pre>$ rpm -q --queryformat "%{SUMMARY}\n" gpg-pubkey</pre>
The command should return the string below:
<pre>gpg(Red Hat, Inc. (release key 2)  &lt;security@redhat.com&gt;</pre>
</ocil>
<rationale>
The Red Hat GPG key is necessary to cryptographically verify packages
are from Red Hat.

<title>Ensure gpgcheck Enabled In Main Yum Configuration</title>
<description>The <tt>gpgcheck</tt> option controls whether
RPM packages' signatures are always checked prior to installation.
To configure yum to check package signatures before installing

the <tt>[main]</tt> section:
<pre>gpgcheck=1</pre>

<pre>gpgcheck=1</pre>
A value of <tt>1</tt> indicates that <tt>gpgcheck</tt> is enabled. Absence of a
