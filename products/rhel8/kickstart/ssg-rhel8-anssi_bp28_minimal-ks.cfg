# SCAP Security Guide ANSSI BP-028 (minimal) profile kickstart for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
# Version: 0.0.1
# Date: 2021-01-28
#
# Based on:
# https://pykickstart.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
# http://usgcb.nist.gov/usgcb/content/configuration/workstation-ks.cfg

# Specify installation method to use for installation
# To use a different one comment out the 'url' one below, update
# the selected choice with proper options & un-comment it
#
# Install from an installation tree on a remote server via FTP or HTTP:
# --url		the URL to install from
#
# Example:
#
# url --url=http://192.168.122.1/image
#
# Modify concrete URL in the above example appropriately to reflect the actual
# environment machine is to be installed in
#
# Other possible / supported installation methods:
# * install from the first CD-ROM/DVD drive on the system:
#
# cdrom
#
# * install from a directory of ISO images on a local drive:
#
# harddrive --partition=hdb2 --dir=/tmp/install-tree
#
# * install from provided NFS server:
#
# nfs --server=<hostname> --dir=<directory> [--opts=<nfs options>]
#
# Set language to use during installation and the default language to use on the installed system (required)
lang en_US.UTF-8

# Set system keyboard type / layout (required)
keyboard us

# Configure network information for target system and activate network devices in the installer environment (optional)
# --onboot	enable device at a boot time
# --device	device to be activated and / or configured with the network command
# --bootproto	method to obtain networking configuration for device (default dhcp)
# --noipv6	disable IPv6 on this device
#
# NOTE: Usage of DHCP will fail CCE-27021-5 (DISA FSO RHEL-06-000292). To use static IP configuration,
#       "--bootproto=static" must be used. For example:
# network --bootproto=static --ip=10.0.2.15 --netmask=255.255.255.0 --gateway=10.0.2.254 --nameserver 192.168.2.1,192.168.3.1
#
network --onboot yes --bootproto dhcp

# Set the system's root password (required)
# Plaintext password is: server
# Refer to e.g.
#   https://pykickstart.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands.html#rootpw
# to see how to create encrypted password form for different plaintext password
rootpw --iscrypted $6$0WWGZ1e6icT$1KiHZK.Nzp3HQerfiy8Ic3pOeCWeIzA.zkQ7mkvYT3bNC5UeGK2ceE5b6TkSg4D/kiSudkT04QlSKknsrNE220

# Set the system time zone (required)
timezone --utc America/New_York

# Specify how the bootloader should be installed (required)
# Plaintext password is: password
# Refer to e.g.
#   https://pykickstart.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands.html#rootpw
# to see how to create encrypted password form for different plaintext password
bootloader --location=mbr

# Initialize (format) all disks (optional)
zerombr

# The following partition layout scheme assumes disk of size 20GB or larger
# Modify size of partitions appropriately to reflect actual machine's hardware
# 
# Remove Linux partitions from the system prior to creating new ones (optional)
# --linux	erase all Linux partitions
# --initlabel	initialize the disk label to the default based on the underlying architecture
clearpart --linux --initlabel

# Create primary system partitions (required for installs)
autopart

# The OpenSCAP installer add-on is used to apply SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol)
# content - security policies - on the installed system.This add-on has been enabled by default
# since Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2. When enabled, the packages necessary to provide this 
# functionality will automatically be installed. However, by default, no policies are enforced,
# meaning that no checks are performed during or after installation unless specifically configured.
#  
#  Important
#   Applying a security policy is not necessary on all systems. This screen should only be used
#   when a specific policy is mandated by your organization rules or government regulations.
#   Unlike most other commands, this add-on does not accept regular options, but uses key-value
#   pairs in the body of the %addon definition instead. These pairs are whitespace-agnostic.
#   Values can be optionally enclosed in single quotes (') or double quotes (").
#   
#  The following keys are recognized by the add-on:
#    content-type - Type of the security content. Possible values are datastream, archive, rpm, and scap-security-guide.
#      - If the content-type is scap-security-guide, the add-on will use content provided by the
#        scap-security-guide package, which is present on the boot media. This means that all other keys except profile will have no effect.
#    content-url - Location of the security content. The content must be accessible using HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP; local storage is currently not supported. A network connection must be available to reach content definitions in a remote location.
#    datastream-id - ID of the data stream referenced in the content-url value. Used only if content-type is datastream.
#    xccdf-id - ID of the benchmark you want to use.
#    xccdf-path - Path to the XCCDF file which should be used; given as a relative path in the archive.
#    profile - ID of the profile to be applied. Use default to apply the default profile.
#    fingerprint - A MD5, SHA1 or SHA2 checksum of the content referenced by content-url.
#    tailoring-path - Path to a tailoring file which should be used, given as a relative path in the archive.
#
#  The following is an example %addon org_fedora_oscap section which uses content from the
#  scap-security-guide on the installation media: 
%addon org_fedora_oscap
	content-type = scap-security-guide
	profile = xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_anssi_bp28_minimal
%end

# Packages selection (%packages section is required)
%packages

# Require @Base
@Base

%end # End of %packages section

# Reboot after the installation is complete (optional)
# --eject	attempt to eject CD or DVD media before rebooting
reboot --eject
