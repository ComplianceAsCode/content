title: 'Firefox must be configured to allow only TLS 1.2 or above.'

description: |-
    Firefox may be configured via administrative policy to allow TLS 1.2 at minimum
    by setting <tt>SSLVersionMin</tt> to <tt>tls1.2</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Use of versions prior to TLS 1.2 are not permitted. SSL 2.0 and SSL 3.0 contain a number of security flaws. 
    These versions must be disabled in compliance with the Network Infrastructure and Secure Remote Computing STIGs.
