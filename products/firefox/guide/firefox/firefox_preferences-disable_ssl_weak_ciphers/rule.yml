title: 'Disable Weak Ciphers in Firefox SSL'

description: |-
    Extension recommendations may be disabled by setting
    <tt>security.ssl3.rsa_des_ede3_sha</tt> to <tt>false</tt>.

rationale: |-
    A weak cipher is defined as an encryption/decryption algorithm that uses a key of insufficient length. Using an insufficient length for a key in an encryption/decryption algorithm opens up the possibility (or probability) that the encryption scheme could be broken.
