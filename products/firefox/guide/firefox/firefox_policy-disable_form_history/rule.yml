title: 'Firefox must be configured to disable form fill assistance.'

description: |-
    The update check may be disabled in an administrative policy by setting
    the <tt>DisableFormHistory</tt> key under <tt>policies</tt> to <tt>true</tt>.

rationale: |-
    To protect privacy and sensitive data, Firefox provides the ability to configure the program so that data entered into forms is not saved. This mitigates the risk of a website gleaning private information from prefilled information.
