title: 'Disable Extension Installation'

description: |-
    Firefox provides the ability to disable the installation of extensions.
    This can be disabled by setting <tt>xpinstall.enabled</tt> to
    <tt>false</tt>.

rationale: |-
    If a browser is configured to allow unrestricted use of extensions then 
    plug-ins can be loaded and installed from malicious sources and used on 
    the browser.
