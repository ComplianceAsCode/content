title: 'Disable Firefox Auto-Update Capability'

description: |-
    Firefox can be set to automatically update as new updates. This can be
    disabled by setting <tt>app.update.enable</tt> to <tt>false</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Allowing software updates from non-trusted sites can introduce settings
    that will override a secured installation of the application. This can
    place DoD information at risk. If this setting is enabled, then there are
    many other default settings which point to untrusted sites which must be
    changed to point to an authorized update site that is not publicly accessible.

ocil: |-
    To verify that Firefox cannot auto-update,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'app.update.enable' <i>FIREFOX_INSTALL_DIR</i>/*.cfg</pre>
    The output should return:
    <pre>lockPref("app.update.enable", false);</pre>
