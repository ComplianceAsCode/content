description: |-
    The update check may be disabled in an administrative policy by setting
    the <tt>DisableForgetButton</tt> key under <tt>policies</tt> to <tt>true</tt>.

rationale: |-
    There should not be an option for a user to "forget" work they have done. This is required to meet non-repudiation controls.

ocil: |-
    To verify that users cannot access the forget button,
    type the following into the browser address bar:
    <pre>about:policies</pre>
    The output should have the following:
    <pre>"DisableForgetButon": true</pre>

template:
    name: firefox_policy-setting
    vars:
        name: Disable Forget button
        policies:
          - {path: "policies", parameter: "DisableForgetButton", value: true}
