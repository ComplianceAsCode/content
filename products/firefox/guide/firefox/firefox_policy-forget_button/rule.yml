title: 'Firefox must be configured to not automatically update installed add-ons and plugins.'

description: |-
    The update check may be disabled in an administrative policy by setting
    the <tt>DisableForgetButton</tt> key under <tt>policies</tt> to <tt>true</tt>.

rationale: |-
    There should not be an option for a user to "forget" work they have done. This is required to meet non-repudiation controls.
