title: 'Enable Certificate Verification'

description: "Firefox can be configured to prompt the user to choose a certificate\nto present to a website when asked. To enable certificate verification, \nset <tt>security.default_personal_cert</tt> to <tt>Ask Every Time</tt>."

rationale: |-
    Websites within DoD require user authentication for access which increases
    security for DoD information. Access will be denied to the user if
    certificate management is not configured.
