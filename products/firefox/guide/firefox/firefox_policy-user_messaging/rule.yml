title: 'Firefox must not recommend extensions as the user is using the browser.'

description: |-
    The extension recommendation messages may be disabled in an administrative policy by setting
    the <tt>ExtensionRecommendations</tt> key under <tt>UserMessaging</tt> to <tt>false</tt>.

rationale: |-
    The Recommended Extensions program recommends extensions to users as they surf the web.
    The user must not be encouraged to install extensions from the websites they visit. Allowed extensions are to be centrally managed.
