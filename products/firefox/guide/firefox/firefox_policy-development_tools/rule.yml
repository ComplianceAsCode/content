title: 'Disable Firefox Development Tools'

description: |-
    Firefox provides development tools which identify detailed information 
    about the browser and its configuration. These details are often also 
    recorded into a log file, giving an attacker the ability to capture 
    detailed information about the system.
    This can be disabled by setting <tt>DisableDeveloperTools</tt> to
    <tt>true</tt> in <tt>policies.json</tt>

rationale: |-
    In order to protect privacy and sensitive data, Mozilla provides
    the ability to configure Firefox so that development tools are prevented from being used.
