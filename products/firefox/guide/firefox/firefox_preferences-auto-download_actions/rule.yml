title: 'Disable Automatic Downloads of MIME Types'

description: |-
    MIME type files are automatically downloaded or executed in Firefox. This
    can be disabled by setting <tt>browser.helperApps.alwaysAsk.force</tt> to
    <tt>true</tt>.

rationale: |-
    The default action for file types for which a plugin is installed is to
    automatically download and execute the file using the associated plugin.
    Firefox allows users to change the specified download action so that the
    file is opened with a selected external application or saved to disk
    instead.

    To verify that user interaction is required for the downloading of MIME types,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'browser.helperApps.alwaysAsk.force' <i>FIREFOX_INSTALL_DIR</i>/*.cfg</pre>
    The output should return:
    <pre>lockPref("browser.helperApps.alwaysAsk.force", "true");</pre>
