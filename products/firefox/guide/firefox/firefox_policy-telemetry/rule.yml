title: 'Disable Firefox Telemetry'

description: |-
    Telemetry can be disabled by setting
    <tt>toolkit.telemetry.enabled</tt> to <tt>false</tt>.

rationale: |-
    The Telemetry feature provides this capability by sending performance and usage info to Mozilla. As you use Firefox, Telemetry measures and collects non-personal information, such as performance, hardware, usage and customizations. It then sends this information to Mozilla on a daily basis and we use it to improve Firefox
