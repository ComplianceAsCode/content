title: 'Disable JavaScript''s Raise Or Lower Windows Capability'

description: |-
    JavaScript can configure and make changes to the web browser's appearance by
    specifically raising and lowering windows. This can be disabled by
    setting <tt>dom.disable_window_flip</tt> to <tt>true</tt> in the policy file.

rationale: |-
    JavaScript can make changes to the browser’s appearance. Allowing a website
    to use JavaScript to raise and lower browser windows may disguise an attack.
