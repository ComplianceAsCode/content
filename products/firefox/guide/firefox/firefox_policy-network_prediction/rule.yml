title: 'Disable Firefox network prediction'

description: |-
    Firefox has a feature where it predicts and caches DNS requests.
    This can be disabled by
    setting <tt>NetworkPrediction</tt> to <tt>true</tt> in the policy file.

rationale: |-
    With network prediction enabled, URL requests are made without user consent.
    Browsers should always make a direct DNS request with prefetching.
