title: 'Disable JavaScript''s Ability To Change The Status Bar'

description: |-
    JavaScript can configure and make changes to the web browser's appearance by
    specifically hiding or changing the status bar. This can be disabled by
    setting <tt>dom.disable_window_status_change</tt> to <tt>true</tt>.

rationale: |-
    When a user visits some webpages, JavaScript can hide or make changes
    to the browser’s appearance to hide unauthorized activity. This activity
    can help disguise an attack taking place in a minimized background window.
