title: 'Clear Data When Firefox Closes'

description: |-
    When a user browses to a website, cookies and other types of data
    get stored on the system. This can be disabled by setting
    <tt>privacy.sanitize.sanitizeOnShutdown</tt> to <tt>true</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Cookies can help websites perform better but can also be part of spyware.
    To mitigate this risk, set browser preferences to perform a Clear Private
    Data operation when closing the browser in order to clear cookies and
    other data installed by websites visited during the session.

    To verify that Firefox clears data on exit,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'privacy.sanitize.sanitizeOnShutdown' <i>FIREFOX_INSTALL_DIR</i>/*.cfg</pre>
    The output should return:
    <pre>lockPref("privacy.sanitize.sanitizeOnShutdown", true);</pre>
