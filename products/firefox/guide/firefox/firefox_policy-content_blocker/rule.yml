title: 'Ensure the Content Blocker uBlock Origin is Installed'

description: |-
    The uBlock Origin will be installed automatically by configuring Firefox policy, and updates will be enabled. It can also be installed through the Mozilla Add-Ons store at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/.

rationale: |-
    The content blocking feature of uBlock Origin stops Firefox from loading content from malicious sites. The content might be a script or an image, for example. If a site is on one of the lists uBlock Origin uses, then the content will not be loaded from that site.
    This may prevent malicious ads from confusing users and concealing the page contents, as well as the loading of content that may contain malware.
severity: medium

ocil: |-
    To verify that the policy is modified to automatically install the content blocker and that it's updates are not disabled,
    type the following into the browser address bar:
    <pre>about:policies</pre>
    The output should have the following under ExtensionSettings:
    <pre>"uBlock0@raymondhill.net": {</pre>
    <pre>"    "installation_mode":"normal_installed",</pre>
    <pre>"    "install_url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/latest/ublock-origin/latest.xpi",</pre>
    <pre>"    "updates_disabled":false}</pre>
