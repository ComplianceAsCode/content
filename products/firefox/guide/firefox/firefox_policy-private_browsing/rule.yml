title: 'Firefox private browsing must be disabled.'

description: |-
    Private browsing may be disabled in an administrative policy by setting
    the <tt>DisablePrivateBrowsing</tt> key under <tt>policies</tt> to <tt>true</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Private browsing allows the user to browse the internet without recording their browsing history/activity. From a forensics perspective, this is unacceptable. Best practice requires that browser history is retained.
