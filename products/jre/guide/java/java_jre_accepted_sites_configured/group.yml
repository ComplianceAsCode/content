title: 'Configure the exception.sites File'

description: |-
    Utilizing a whitelist provides a configuration management method for
    allowing the execution of only authorized software. Using only authorized
    software decreases risk by limiting the number of potential vulnerabilities.
    The <tt>exception.sites</tt> file is used for ensuring that authorized
    software is allowed to be executed. To ensure that the Java
    <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt> file is configured
    correctly, <tt>deployment.user.security.exception.sites</tt> must be configured
    to point to a valid <tt>exception.sites</tt> file.
