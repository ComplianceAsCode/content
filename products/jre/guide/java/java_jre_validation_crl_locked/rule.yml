title: 'Disable User Access to Certificate Revocation List Settings'

description: |-
    To ensure that users cannot change certificate revocation list settings,
    add <tt>deployment.security.validation.crl.locked</tt> to
    <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Permitting execution of an applet published with a revoked certificate may
    result in spoofing, malware, system modification, invasion of privacy, and
    denial of service. This is why it is important to ensure to check against a
    Certificate Revocation List. As such, ensuring users cannot change settings
    contributes to a more consistent security profile.
