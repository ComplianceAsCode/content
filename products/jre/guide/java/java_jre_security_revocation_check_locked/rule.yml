title: 'Disable User Access to Revocation Check Settings'

description: |-
    To ensure that users cannot change certificate revocation check settings,
    add <tt>deployment.security.revocation.check.locked</tt> to
    <tt>/etc/.java/deployment/deployment.properties</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Permitting execution of an applet published with a revoked certificate may
    result in spoofing, malware, system modification, invasion of privacy,
    and denial of service. As such, ensuring users cannot change settings
    contributes to a more consistent security profile.
