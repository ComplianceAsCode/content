title: 'Ensure Java Runtime Environment Is A Vendor Supported Version'

description: |-
    Evaluated JBoss installation must use a vendor supported
    Java virtual machine - i.e., one that has not reached end-of-life.
    Migration strategies should be developed when end-of-life is impending.

rationale: |-
    Java installations should be a vendor supported version. If the Java
    virtual machine in use by JBoss is not supported by the vendor, this
    may result in outages, unresolvable problems, no access to security
    or functional updates, etc.
