title: 'Ensure All Downloaded Software Is Validated'

description: |-
    Software and packages should be downloaded from
    redhat.com, and hash validated.

rationale: |-
    Without validating downloaded files are authentic, malicious users
    may compromise software before it has even been installed. Attackers
    may redirect traffic to alternate download locations and attempt to
    trick administrators into downloading modified software.
