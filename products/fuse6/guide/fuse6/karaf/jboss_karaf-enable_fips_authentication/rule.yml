title: 'Enable FIPS for User and Process Authentication'

description: |-
    The Application Server must utilize FIPS 140-2 approved
    encryption modules when authenticating users and processes.

rationale: |-
    Encryption is only as good as the encryption modules utilized. Unapproved
    cryptographic module algorithms cannot be verified, and cannot be relied
    upon to provide confidentiality or integrity and DoD data may be
    compromised due to weak algorithms.Â FIPS 140-2 is the current standard for
    validating cryptographic modules and NSA Type-X (where X=1, 2, 3, 4)
    products are NSA certified hardware-based encryption modules.

severity: medium
