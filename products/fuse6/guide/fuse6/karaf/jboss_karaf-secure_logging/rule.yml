title: 'Ensure JBoss Logging Is Secured'

description: |-
    Only error messages that provide information necessary
    for corrective actions without revealing sensitive or potentially harmful
    information in error logs and administrative messages should be generated.

rationale: |-
    Any application providing too much information in error logs and in
    administrative messages to the screen risks compromising the data and
    security of the application and system. The structure and content of error
    messages needs to be carefully considered by the organization and
    development team.

ocil_clause: 'logging is not configured to prevent sensitive information from being revealed'
