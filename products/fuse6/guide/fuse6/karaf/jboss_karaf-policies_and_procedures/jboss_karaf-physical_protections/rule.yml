title: 'Ensure Adequate Physical Protections'

description: |-
    The hardware and software executing JBoss Fuse, as
    well as the software critical to security policy enforcement must
    be protected from unauthorized modification including unauthorized
    modifications by potentially hostile outsiders. Reasonable physical
    security measures to ensure that unauthorized personnel do not have
    physical access to the hardware running the JBoss Enterprise
    Application Platform software must be implemented.

rationale: |-
    Many software security precautions can easily be bypassed by
    personnel with physical access to hardware storing data or
    executing an application.
