title: 'Disable or Remove Clear-Text Passwords'

description: |-
    Eliminate clear-text passwords in JBoss configuration
    files. All passwords should be encrypted and all password files
    should have restricted file permissions.

rationale: |-
    Clear-text passwords are an unnecessary security vulnerability.
    While risk of exposure can be mitigated through configured
    permissions and file ownership, these methods do not completely
    remediate the risk.
