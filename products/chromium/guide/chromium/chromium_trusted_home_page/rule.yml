title: 'Set the Default Home Page'

description: |-
    When a browser is started the first web page displayed is the "home page".
    While the home page can be selected by the user, the default home page needs
    to be defined to display an approved page. To set the default home page,
    set <tt>HomepageLocation</tt> to <tt><sub idref="var_trusted_home_page" /></tt>
    in the Chromium policy file.

rationale: |-
    If no home page is defined then there is a possibility that a URL to a malicious
    site may be used as a home page which could effectively cause a denial of service
    to the browser.
