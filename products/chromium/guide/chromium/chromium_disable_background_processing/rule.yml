title: 'Disable Background Processing'

description: |-
    Chromium can be set to run at all times and process in the background. This
    should be disabled by setting <tt>BackgroundModeEnabled</tt> to <tt>false</tt>
    in the Chromium policy file.

rationale: |-
    There is two reasons that this is not wanted. First, it can tie up system
    resources that might otherwise be needed. Second, it does not make it
    obvious to the user that it is running and poorly written extensions could
    cause instability on the system.

severity: unknown

ocil_clause: 'it is not disabled'

ocil: |-
    To verify that background processing is disabled, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep BackgroundModeEnabled /etc/chromium/policies/managed/*.json</pre>
    The output should contain:
    <pre>"BackgroundModeEnabled": false,</pre>
