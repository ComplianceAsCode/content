title: 'Disable the AutoFill Feature'

description: |-
    The AutoFill feature suggests possible matches when users are filling in forms. To
    disable the AutoFill feature, set <tt>AutoFillEnabled</tt> to <tt>false</tt> in
    the Chromium policy file.

rationale: |-
    It is possible with the AutoFill feature that it will cache sensitive data and store
    it in the user's profile, where it might not be protected as rigorously as required by
    organizational policy.

severity: unknown
