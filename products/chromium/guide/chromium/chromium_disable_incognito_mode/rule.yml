title: 'Disable Incognito Mode'

description: |-
    Incognito Mode allows users to browse in private which prevents monitoring
    and validating user browsing habits. This capability should be disabled by
    setting <tt>IncognitoModeAvailability</tt> to <tt>1</tt> in the Chromium
    policy file.

rationale: |-
    Incognito mode allows the user to browse the Internet without recording their
    browsing history/activity. From a forensics perspective, this is unacceptable.
    Best practice requires that browser history is retained.

severity: unknown

ocil: |-
    To verify that incognito mode is disabled, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep IncognitoModeAvailability /etc/chromium/policies/managed/*.json</pre>
    The output should contain:
    <pre>"IncognitoModeAvailability": 1,</pre>
