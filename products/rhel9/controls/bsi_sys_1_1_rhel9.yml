# In BSI Basic Protection are multiple Requirements in one control.
# i.e. there are multiple sentences, some including a RFC2119 keyword
# Since we must increase granularity to create a precise control,
# we number each sentence with a RFC2119 keyword as a section, grouping sentences, which are logically connected.
# we number inline in brackets, so the lookup is easy
# we reference these numbers in comments over each rule or group of rules
