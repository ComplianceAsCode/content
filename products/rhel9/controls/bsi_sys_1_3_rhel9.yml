# In BSI Basic Protection are multiple Requirements in one control.
# i.e. there are multiple sentences, some including a RFC2119 keyword
# Since we must increase granularity to create a precise control,
# we number each sentence with a RFC2119 keyword as a section, grouping sentences, which are logically connected.
# we number inline in brackets, so the lookup is easy
# we reference these numbers in comments over each rule or group of rules

          file MUST be defined in the /etc/group file. (4) Every group SHOULD only contain the users that
          are absolutely necessary. (5) In networked systems, care MUST also be taken to ensure that user
          and group names (UIDs and GIDs) are assigned consistently in the system network if there is a
          possibility that the same UIDs or GIDs could be assigned to different user or group names on
