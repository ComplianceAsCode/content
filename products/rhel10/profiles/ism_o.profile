title: 'DRAFT - Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) ISM Official - Base'

description: |-
    This draft profile contains configuration checks for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10
    that align to the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) Information Security Manual (ISM).

    The ISM uses a risk-based approach to cyber security. This profile provides a guide to aligning
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux security controls with the ISM, which can be used to select controls
    specific to an organisation's security posture and risk profile.

    A copy of the ISM can be found at the ACSC website:
