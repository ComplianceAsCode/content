title: 'DRAFT - CIS Fedora Benchmark for Level 2 - Server'

description: |-
    This is a draft profile for experimental purposes.
    It is based on the CIS Fedora 40 Branch Benchmark maintained by CIS Community.
    Although the CIS Fedora Benchmarks are used as upstream for CIS Red Hat Benchmarks, they are
    not released as often as Fedora releases and therefore are expected to diverge along the time.
    This profile is currently maintained in best efforts for current Fedora releases.
