    Only SSH protocol version 2 connections should be
    permitted. The default setting in
    <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt> is correct, and can be
    verified by ensuring that the following
    line appears:
    <pre>Protocol 2</pre>

rationale: |-
    SSH protocol version 1 suffers from design flaws that
    result in security vulnerabilities and
    should not be used.

severity: high
