This is incoherent. There is no apparent relationship between the title, description, and
fixtext/checktext. The checking text lists user IDs in
/etc/passwd, which have nothing to do with group IDs.  If something coherent is
presented it could be considered for inclusion for RHEL 6, but even then, the
possibilities suggest checking for a highly unlikely configuration which is not
worth inclusion in a baseline.
