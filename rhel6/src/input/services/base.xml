<title>Base Services</title>
<description>This section addresses the base services that are installed on a RHEL 6 default installation.
Some of these services listen on the network and should be treated with particular discretion. The other
services are local system utilities that may or may not be extraneous. Each of these services should be
disabled if not required.

<Rule id="service_abrtd_disabled">
<title>Disable Automatic Bug Reporting Tool (abrtd)</title>
<description>The Automatic Bug Reporting Tool (abrtd) is a daemon that collects and reports crash data
when an application crash is detected. Using a variety of plugins abrtd can email crash reports to system
administrators, log crash reports to files, or forward crash reports to a centralized issue tracking
system such as RHTSupport. Mishandling crash data exposes sensitive information about vulnerablities in
software executing on the local machine. For most deployments this daemon should be disabled.

A number of default services make use of D-Bus, including X Windows, Bluetooth, and Avahi. This guide
recommends that D-Bus and all its dependencies be disabled unless there is a mission-critical need
for them. Stricter configuration of D-Bus is possible and documented in the man page dbus-daemon(1).
