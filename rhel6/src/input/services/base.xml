<title>Base Services</title>
<description>This section addresses the base services that are installed on a RHEL 6 default installation.
Some of these services listen on the network and should be treated with particular discretion. The other
services are local system utilities that may or may not be extraneous. Each of these services should be
disabled if not required.

<Rule id="service_abrtd_disabled">
<title>Disable Automatic Bug Reporting Tool (abrtd)</title>
<description>The Automatic Bug Reporting Tool (abrtd) is a daemon that collects and reports crash data
when an application crash is detected. Using a variety of plugins abrtd can email crash reports to system
administrators, log crash reports to files, or forward crash reports to a centralized issue tracking
system such as RHTSupport. Mishandling crash data exposes sensitive information about vulnerablities in
software executing on the local machine. For most deployments this daemon should be disabled.

tasks scheduled via <tt>at</tt> and <tt>batch</tt> and executes them at the specified time. Unless

<title>Bluetooth</title>
<description>Bluetooth provides a way to transfer information between devices such as mobile phones, laptops, PCs, printers, digital cameras, and video game consoles over a short-range wireless link. Any wireless communication presents a serious security risk to sensitive or classified systems.
Removal of hardware is the only way to ensure that the Bluetooth wireless capability remains disabled. If it is completely impractical to remove the Bluetooth hardware module, and site policy still allows the device to enter sensitive spaces, every effort to disable the capability via software should be made. In general, acquisition policy should include provisions to prevent the purchase of equipment that will be used in sensitive spaces and includes Bluetooth capabilities.

<description>D-Bus is an IPC mechanism that provides a common channel for inter-process communication.
A number of default services make use of D-Bus, including X Windows, Bluetooth, and Avahi. This guide
recommends that D-Bus and all its dependencies be disabled unless there is a mission-critical need
for them. Stricter configuration of D-Bus is possible and documented in the man page dbus-daemon(1).
D-Bus maintains two separate configuration files, located in /etc/dbus-1/, one for system-specific

/etc/ntp/step-tickers (or /etc/ntp.conf if there are no NTP servers defined in
/etc/ntp/step-tickers) and then sets the local hardware clock to the newly synchronized
system time. This service is best suited for workstations which are rebooted more often than
