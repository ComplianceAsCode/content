<title>SNMP Server</title>
<description>The Simple Network Management Protocol allows
administrators to monitor the state of network devices, including
computers. Older versions of SNMP were well-known for weak
security, such as plaintext transmission of the community string
(used for authentication) and also usage of easily-guessable
choices for community string.</description>

<title>Disable SNMP Server if Possible</title>
<description>The system includes an SNMP daemon that allows for its
remote monitoring, though it not installed by default. If it was
installed and activated, the software should be disabled and removed.

<Rule id="disable_snmpd">
<title>Disable <tt>snmpd</tt> Service</title>
<description>
The <tt>snmpd</tt> service can be disabled with the following command:
<pre># chkconfig snmpd off</pre>
</description>
<rationale>
Running SNMP software provides a network-based avenue of attack, and
should be disabled if not needed.

<title>Uninstall <tt>net-snmp</tt> Package</title>
<description>The <tt>net-snmp</tt> package, which provides the snmpd service,
can be uninstalled with the following command:
<pre># yum erase net-snmpd</pre>
</description>

If there is no need to run SNMP server software,
removing the package provides a safeguard against its
activation.

<title>Configure SNMP Server if Necessary</title>
<description>If it is necessary to run the snmpd agent on the system, some best practices should be followed to minimize the
security risk from the installation. The multiple security models implemented by SNMP cannot be fully covered
here so only the following general configuration advice can be offered:
<ul>
<li>use only SNMP version 3 security models and enable the use of authentication and encryption</li>
<li>write access to the MIB (Management Information Base) should be allowed only if necessary</li>
<li>all access to the MIB should be restricted following a principle of least privilege</li>
<li>network access should be limited to the maximum extent possible including restricting to expected network
addresses both in the configuration files and in the system firewall rules</li>
<li>ensure SNMP agents send traps only to, and accept SNMP queries only from, authorized management
stations</li>
<li>ensure that permissions on the <tt>snmpd.conf</tt> configuration file (by default, in <tt>/etc/snmp</tt>) are 640 or more restrictive</li>
<li>ensure that any MIB filesâ€™ permissions are also 640 or more restrictive</li></ul>
