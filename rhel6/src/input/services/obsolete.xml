<title>Obsolete Services</title>
<description>This section discusses a number of network-visible
services which have historically caused problems for system
security, and for which disabling or severely limiting the service
has been the best available guidance for some time. As a result of
this consensus, these services are not installed as part of RHEL6
by default.
<br /><br />
Organizations which are running these services should
prioritize switching to more secure services which provide the
needed functionality. If it is absolutely necessary to run one of
these services for legacy reasons, care should be taken to restrict
the service as much as possible, for instance by configuring host
firewall software (see Section 2.5.5) to restrict access to the
vulnerable service to only those remote hosts which have a known
need to use it.</description>

<Group id="inetd_and_xinetd">
<title>Inetd and Xinetd</title>
<description>Is there an operational need to run the deprecated
inetd or xinetd software packages? If not, ensure that they are
removed from the system:
<pre># yum erase inetd xinetd</pre>
Beginning with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, the <tt>xinetd</tt> service
is no longer installed by default. This change represents increased
awareness that the dedicated network listener model does not
improve security or reliability of services, and that restriction
of network listeners is better handled using a granular model such
as SELinux than using <tt>xinetd</tt>'s limited security
options.</description>

<title>Telnet</title>
<description>Is there a mission-critical reason for users to access
the system via the insecure telnet protocol, rather than the more
secure SSH protocol? If not, ensure that the telnet server is
removed from the system:
<pre># yum erase telnet-server</pre>
The telnet protocol uses unencrypted network communication,
which means that data from the login session, including passwords
and all other information transmitted during the session, can be
stolen by eavesdroppers on the network, and also that outsiders can
easily hijack the session to gain authenticated access to the
telnet server. Organizations which use telnet should be actively
working to migrate to a more secure protocol.
<br /><br />

See Section 3.5 for information about the SSH service.</description>

<Rule id="disable_telnet_service" severity="high">

<rationale>
The telnet protocol uses unencrypted network communication, which

The Network Information Service (NIS), also known as 'Yellow

Kerberos, LDAP, and other modern centralized authentication
services. NIS should not be used because it suffers from security
problems inherent in its design, such as inadequate protection of
important authentication information.</description>

TFTP is a lightweight version of the FTP protocol which has
traditionally been used to configure networking equipment. However,
TFTP provides little security, and modern versions of networking
operating systems frequently support configuration via SSH or other
more secure protocols. A TFTP server should be run only if no more
secure method of supporting existing equipment can be
found.</description>
