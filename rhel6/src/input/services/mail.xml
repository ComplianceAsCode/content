<title>Mail Server Software</title>
<description>
Mail servers are used to send and receive email over the network.
Mail is a very common service, and Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) are obvious 
targets of network attack. 
Ensure that machines are not running MTAs unnecessarily, 
and configure needed MTAs as defensively as possible.

Very few systems at any site should be configured to directly receive email over the 
network.  Users should instead use mail clients programs to retrieve email  
from a central server that support protocols such as IMAP or POP3.  
However, it is normal for most systems to be independently capable of sending email, 
for instance so that cron jobs can report output to an administrator. 
Most MTAs, including Postfix, support a submission-only mode in which mail can be sent from 
the local system to a central site MTA (or directly delivered to a local account), 
but the system still cannot receive mail directly over a network.

The <tt>alternatives</tt> program in RHEL permits selection of other mail server software 
(such as Sendmail), but Postfix is the default and is preferred.
Postfix was coded with security in mind and can also be more effectively contained by 
SELinux as its modular design has resulted in separate processes performing specific actions. 
More information is available on its website, http://www.postfix.org.</description>

<description>The mail server is a frequent target of network attack from the outside. However, since all site users receive mail,
the mail server must be open to some connection from each inside users. It is strongly recommended that these
functions be separated, by having an externally visible mail server which processes all incoming and outgoing
mail, then forwards internal mail to a separate machine from which users can access it.

<title>Configure SSL Certificates for Use with SMTP AUTH</title>
<description>If SMTP AUTH is to be used, the use of SSL to protect credentials in transit is strongly recommended. 
There are also configurations for which it may be desirable to encrypt all mail in transit from one MTA to another, 
though such configurations are beyond the scope of this guide. In either event, the steps for creating and installing 
an SSL certificate are independent of the MTA in use, and are described here.
</description>

<Rule id="postfix_create_cert">

Change into the CA certificate directory:
# cd /etc/pki/tls/certs
Generate a key pair for the mail server:

# openssl genrsa -out mailserverkey.pem 2048
</pre>
Next, generate a certificate signing request (CSR) for the CA to sign, making sure to supply your mail
server’s fully qualified domain name as the Common Name:
<pre>
# openssl req -new -key mailserverkey.pem -out mailserver.csr
</pre>
Next, the mail server CSR must be signed to create the mail server certificate. You can either send the CSR
to an established CA or sign it with your CA.
To sign mailserver.csr using your CA:
<pre>
# openssl ca -in mailserver.csr -out mailservercert.pem
</pre>
</description>
<rationale>This step creates a private key, mailserverkey.pem, and a public certificate, mailservercert.pem. The mail
server will use these to prove its identity by demonstrating that it has a certificate which has been signed by a
CA. Mail clients at your site should be willing to send their mail only to a server they can authenticate.
</rationale>
<warning category="general">Note: This step must be performed on your CA system, not on the MTA host itself. If you will have a commercial
CA sign certificates, then this step should be performed on a separate, physically secure system devoted to that

<rationale>These configuration options serve to make it more difficult for attackers to consume resources on the MTA host.
The default process limit parameter controls how many smtpd processes can exist at a time, while smtpd 
client connection count limit controls the number of those which can be occupied by any one 
remote sender, and smtpd client connection rate limit controls the number of connections any one client 
can make per minute. By default, local hosts (those in mynetworks) are exempted from per-client rate limiting.
The queue minfree parameter establishes a free space threshold, in order to stop e-mail receipt before the
queue filesystem is entirely full. The header size limit, message size limit, and smtpd recipient limit
parameters place bounds on the legal sizes of messages received via SMTP.

<rationale>The default greeting banner discloses that the listening mail process is Postfix.  
When remote mail senders connect to the MTA on port 25, they are greeted by an initial banner as part of

the MTA software which is in use, and sometimes also its version number. Remote mail senders do not need
this information in order to send mail, so the banner should be changed to reveal only the hostname (which is
already known and may be useful) and the word ESMTP, to indicate that the modern SMTP protocol variant is
supported.

<description>Postfix’s mail relay controls are implemented with the help of the smtpd recipient restrictions option, which

The guidance in the following sections should be applied to all machines. If there are machines which

with SSL support.

<description>Edit <tt>/etc/postfix/main.cf</tt>, and configure the contents of the mynetworks variable in one of the following

If any machine in the subnet containing the MTA may be trusted to relay messages, add or correct the line:
<pre>

If only the MTA host itself is trusted to relay messages, add or correct:

organization be placed in mynetworks, and users of all other machines be required to use SMTP AUTH to send

<title>Require SMTP AUTH Before Relaying from Untrusted Clients</title>
<description>SMTP authentication allows remote clients to relay mail safely by requiring them to authenticate before submit-
ting mail. Postfix’s SMTP AUTH uses an authentication library called SASL, which is not part of Postfix itself.
This section describes how to configure authentication using the Cyrus-SASL implementation. See below for a
discussion of other options.
<br />
To enable the use of SASL authentication, edit <tt>/etc/postfix/main.cf</tt> and add or correct the following
settings:
<pre>
smtpd_sasl_auth_enable = yes
smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
    ...
    permit_mynetworks,
    permit_sasl_authenticated,
    reject_unauth_destination,
    ...
</pre>
Then edit <tt>/usr/lib/sasl2/smtpd.conf</tt> and add or correct the following line with the correct authentication
mechanism for SASL to use:
<pre>
pwcheck_method: saslauthd
</pre>
Enable the saslauthd daemon:
<pre>
# chkconfig saslauthd on
</pre>
</description>
<rationale>Postfix can use either the Cyrus library or Dovecot as a source for SASL authentication. If this host is running
Dovecot for some other reason, it is recommended that Dovecot’s SASL support be used instead of running the
Cyrus code as well. See http://www.postfix.org/SASL_README.html for instructions on implementing that
configuration, which is not described in this guide.
In Postfix’s configuration, the directive smtpd sasl auth enable tells smtpd to allow the use of the SMTP AUTH
command during the SMTP dialogue, and to support that command by getting authentication information from
SASL. The smtpd recipient restrictions directive is changed so that, if the client is not connecting from a
trusted address, it is allowed to attempt authentication (permit sasl authenticated) in order to relay mail.
The file /usr/lib/sasl2/smtpd.conf is the Cyrus-SASL configuration file. The pwcheck method directive tells
SASL how to find passwords. The simplest method, described above, is to run a separate authentication daemon,
saslauthd, which is able to communicate with the system authentication system. On RHEL6, saslauthd uses
PAM by default, which should work in most cases. If you have a centralized authentication system which does not
work via PAM, look at the saslauthd(8) manpage to find out how to configure saslauthd for your environment.

<rationale>These options tell Postfix to protect all SMTP AUTH transactions using TLS. The first four options describe
the locations of the necessary TLS key files.
The smtpd tls security level directive tells smtpd to allow the STARTTLS command during the SMTP protocol
exchange, but not to require it for mail senders. (Unless your site receives mail only from other trusted sites
whose sysadmins can be asked to maintain a copy of your site certificate, you do not want to require TLS for all
SMTP exchanges.)
The smtpd tls auth only directive tells smtpd to require the STARTTLS command before allowing the client to
attempt to authenticate for relaying using SMTP AUTH. It may not be possible to use this directive if you must
allow relaying from non-TLS-capable client software. If this is the case, simply omit that line.
