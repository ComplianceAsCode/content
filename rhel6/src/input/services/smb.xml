<title>Samba(SMB) Microsoft Windows File Sharing Server</title>
<description>When properly configured, the Samba service allows
Linux machines to provide file and print sharing to Microsoft
Windows machines. There are two software packages that provide
Samba support. The first, <tt>samba-client</tt>, provides a series of
command line tools that enable a client machine to access Samba
shares. The second, simply labeled samba, provides the Samba
service. It is this second package that allows a Linux machine to
act as an Active Directory server, a domain controller, or as a
domain member. Only the <tt>samba-client</tt> package is installed by
default.</description>

Even after the Samba server package has been installed, it
will remain disabled. Do not enable this service unless it is
absolutely necessary to provide Microsoft Windows file and print
sharing functionality.

<description>All settings for the Samba daemon can be found in
<tt>/etc/samba/smb.conf</tt>. Settings are divided between a
<tt>[global]</tt> configuration section and a series of user
created share definition sections meant to describe file or print
shares on the system. By default, Samba will operate in user mode
and allow client machines to access local home directories and
printers. It is recommended that these settings be changed or that
additional limitations be set in place.</description>

Typically, administrator access is required when Samba must create user and machine accounts and shares. Domain member servers and standalone servers may not need administrator access at all. If that is the case, add the invalid users parameter to [global] instead.

<title>Disable Root Access</title>
<description>By default, Samba will attempt to negotiate with Microsoft Windows machines to set a common communication protocol.
Newer versions of Microsoft Windows may require the use of NTLMv2. NTLMv2 is the preferred protocol for authentication, but since older machines do not support it, Samba has disabled it by default. Enable it with the following:
<pre>[global]
  client ntlmv2 auth = yes</pre>
<!-- This is the default: Whenever possible, be sure to disable LANMAN authentication, as it is far weaker than the other supported protocols.
<pre>[global]
  client lanman auth = no</pre>-->
</description>
<rationale>
For the sake of backwards compatibility, most modern Windows machines will still allow other machines to communicate with them over weak protocols such as LANMAN. On Samba, by enabling NTLMv2, you are also disabling LANMAN and NTLMv1. If NTLMv1 is required, it is still possible to individually disable LANMAN.</rationale>

<description>Add or correct an add machine script entry to the <tt>[global]</tt> section of <tt>/etc/samba/smb.conf</tt> to allow
Samba to dynamically create Machine Trust Accounts:
<pre>[global]
  add machine script = /usr/sbin/useradd -n -g machines -d /dev/null -s /sbin/nologin %u</pre>
Make sure that the group machines exists. If not, add it with the following command:
<pre># /usr/sbin/groupadd machines</pre>
</description>
<rationale>When acting as a PDC, it becomes necessary to create and store Machine Trust Accounts for each machine that joins the domain. On a Microsoft Windows PDC, this account is created with the Server Manager tool, but on a Samba PDC, two accounts must be created. The first is the local machine account, and the second is the Samba account. For security purposes, it is recommended to let Samba create these accounts on-the-fly. When Machine Trust Accounts are created manually, there is a small window of opportunity in which a rogue machine could join the domain in place of the new server.</rationale>

<title>Restrict File Sharing</title>
<description>Only users with local user accounts will be able to log in to Samba shares by default. Shares can be limited to particular users or network addresses. Use the <tt>hosts allow</tt> and <tt>hosts deny</tt> directives accordingly, and consider setting the valid users directive to a limited subset of users or to a group of users. Separate each
address, user, or user group with a space as follows:
<pre>[share]
  hosts allow = 192.168.1. 127.0.0.1
  valid users = userone usertwo @usergroup</pre>
It is also possible to limit read and write access to particular users with the read list and write list options, though the permissions set by the system itself will override these settings. Set the read only attribute for each share to ensure that global settings will not accidentally override the individual share settings. Then, as with the valid users directive, separate each user or group of users with a space:
<pre>[share]
  read only = yes
  write list = userone usertwo @usergroup</pre>

<Rule id="smb_disable_printing">
<title>Restrict Printer Sharing</title>
<description>By default, Samba utilizes the CUPS printing service to enable printer sharing with Microsoft Windows workstations. If there are no printers on the local machine, or if printer sharing with Microsoft Windows is not required, disable the printer sharing capability by commenting out the following lines, found in <tt>/etc/samba/smb.conf</tt>:
<pre>[global]
  load printers = yes
  cups options = raw
[printers]
  comment = All Printers
  path = /usr/spool/samba
  browseable = no
  guest ok = no
  writable = no
  printable = yes</pre>
There may be other options present, but these are the only options enabled and uncommented by default. Removing the <tt>[printers]</tt> share should be enough for most users.
If the Samba printer sharing capability is needed, consider disabling the Samba network browsing capability or restricting access to a particular set of users or network addresses. Set the <tt>valid users</tt> parameter to a small subset of users or restrict it to a particular group of users with the shorthand <tt>@</tt>. Separate each user or group of users with a space. For example, under the <tt>[printers]</tt> share:
<pre>[printers]
  valid users = user @printerusers</pre>
