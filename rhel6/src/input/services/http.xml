<title>Web Server</title>
<description>The web server is responsible for providing access to
content via the HTTP protocol. Web servers represent a significant
security risk because:
<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>The HTTP port is commonly probed by malicious sources</li>
<li>Web server software is very complex, and includes a long
history of vulnerabilities</li>
<li>The HTTP protocol is unencrypted and vulnerable to passive
monitoring</li>
</ul>
<br /><br />
The system's default web server software is Apache 2 and is
provided in the RPM package <tt>httpd</tt>.</description>

<title>Disable Apache if Possible</title>
<description>If Apache was installed and activated, but the system
does not need to act as a web server, then it should be disabled
and removed from the system.
