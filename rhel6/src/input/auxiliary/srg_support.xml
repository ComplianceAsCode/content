<title>Documentation to Support DISA OS SRG Mapping</title>
<description>These groups exist to document how the Red Hat Enterprise Linux
product meets (or does not meet) requirements listed in the DISA OS SRG, for
those cases where Groups or Rules elsewhere in scap-security-guide do
not clearly relate.

<Group id="met_inherently" hidden="true">
<title>Product Meets this Requirement</title>
<description>
Red Hat Enterprise Linux meets this requirement by design.
<!-- We could include discussion of Common Criteria Testing if so 
     desired here. -->

<Rule id="audit_account_termination">
<title>The operating system must notify, as required, appropriate individuals for account termination.</title>
<description>Monitoring account termination is critical to ensure a denial of service situation does not exist on the operating system.  An unexpected account termination can also be a sign of a rogue administrator account that may be deleting traces of activity.  In order to facilitate the monitoring, the operating system must notify designated personnel when an account is terminated.</description>
<rationale>The Red Hat Enterprise Linux Auditing Subsystem provides this functionality natively, placing this information in the audit logs for system administrator review.</rationale>
<ref disa="1686" />
</Rule>

<Rule id="audit_account_creation">
<title>The operating system must notify, as required, appropriate individuals when accounts are created.</title>
<description>Monitoring account creation is critical to ensure only appropriate personnel have access to the operating system.  This reduces the possibility a rogue account will be created.  In order to facilitate the monitoring, the operating system must notify designated personnel when an account is created.</description>

<Rule id="enforce_DAC">
<title>The operating system must enforce a Discretionary Access Control (DAC) policy that includes or excludes access to the granularity of a single user</title>

<Group id="unmet_impractical_guidance" hidden="true">
<title>Guidance Does Not Meet this Requirement Due to Impracticality or Scope</title>
<description>
The guidance does not meet this requirement.
The requirement is impractical or out of scope.
</description>
<ref disa="354,1094" />

<Rule id="enforce_remote_connections">
<title>The operating system must enforce requirements for remote connections to the information system</title>
<description>The organization will define the requirements for connection of remote connections.  In order
to ensure the connection provides adequate integrity and confidentiality of the connection, the operating system must enforce these requirements.
</description>
<rationale>The technical specifications to meet this policy are organizationally defined, and therefor generic guidance is not availabile.</rationale>
<ref disa="66" />
</Rule>

<Rule id="central_config_management">
<title>The operating system must employ automated mechanisms to centrally manage configuration settings</title>
<description>Configuration settings are the configurable security-related parameters of information technology
products that are part of the information system. Security-related parameters are those parameters
impacting the security state of the system including parameters related to meeting other security control
requirements. Security-related parameters include, for example, registry settings; account, file, and directory 
settings (i.e., permissions); and settings for services, ports, protocols, and remote connections. Rather 
than visiting each system when making configuration changes, organizations must employ automated tools that 
can make changes across all systems. This greatly increases efficiency and manageability of applications in a 
large scale environment.</description>
<rationale>An organizational configuration management policy is out of scope of this security guide.</rationale>
