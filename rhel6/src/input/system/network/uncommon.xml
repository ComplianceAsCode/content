<title>Uncommon Network Protocols</title>
<description>The system includes support for several network
protocols which are not commonly used. Although security vul-
nerabilities in kernel networking code are not frequently
discovered, the consequences can be dramatic. Ensuring uncommon
network protocols are disabled reduces the systemâ€™s risk to attacks
targeted at its implementation of those protocols.</description>
<warning>
Although these protocols are not commonly used, avoid disruption
in your network environment by ensuring they are not needed
prior to disabling them.

<title>Disable DCCP Support</title>
<description>To prevent the DCCP kernel module from being loaded,
add the following line to <tt>/etc/modprobe.conf</tt>:
<pre>install dccp /bin/true</pre>
The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) is a
relatively new transport layer protocol, designed to support
streaming media and telephony.
</description>
<rationale>
Disabling DCCP protects
the system against exploitation of any flaws in its implementation.

<title>Disable SCTP Support</title>
<description>To prevent the SCTP kernel module from being loaded,
add the following line to <tt>/etc/modprobe.conf</tt>:
<pre>install sctp /bin/true</pre>
The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a
transport layer protocol, designed to support the idea of
message-oriented communication, with several streams of messages
within one connection.

Disabling SCTP protects
the system against exploitation of any flaws in its implementation.

<description>To prevent the RDS kernel module from being loaded,
add the following line to <tt>/etc/modprobe.conf</tt>:
<pre>install rds /bin/true</pre>
The Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol is a transport
layer protocol designed to provide reliable high- bandwidth,
low-latency communications between nodes in a cluster.

Disabling RDS protects
the system against exploitation of any flaws in its implementation.

The Transparent Inter-Process Communication (TIPC) protocol
is designed to provide communications between nodes in a
cluster.
