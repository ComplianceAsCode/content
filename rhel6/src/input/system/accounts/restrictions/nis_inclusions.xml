<title>Remove Legacy + Entries from Password Files</title>
<description>
The + symbol could be used by systems to include data from NIS
maps into existing files. However, a certain configuration error in
which a NIS inclusion line appears in <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>, but NIS
is not running, could lead to anyone being able to access the system with
the username + and no password. Therefore, it is important to
verify that no such line appears in any of the relevant system
files.
<br /><br />
The command:
<br />
<pre>
# grep "^+:" /etc/passwd /etc/shadow /etc/group
</pre>
should produce no output.
<br /><br />
The correct way to tell the local system to consult network
databases such as LDAP or NIS for user information is to make
appropriate modifications to <tt>/etc/nsswitch.conf</tt>.</description>

The <tt>/etc/shadow</tt> file should include no NIS inclusions,
which are lines beginning with '+:'.

<rationale>
NIS is obsolete and should not be used. Furthermore,
presence of '+' entries can lead to
unauthenticated login.
