<title>Disk Partitioning</title>
<description>Some system directories should be placed on their own
partitions (or logical volumes). This allows for better separation
and protection of data.
<br />
The installerâ€™s default partitioning scheme creates separate
partitions (or logical volumes) for <tt>/</tt>, <tt>/boot</tt>, and
<tt>swap</tt>.
<ul>
<li>If starting with any of the default layouts, check the box to
"Review and modify partitioning." This allows for the easy creation
of additional logical volumes inside the volume group already
created, though it may require making <tt>/</tt>'s logical volume smaller to
create space. In general, using logical volumes is preferable to
using partitions because they can be more easily adjusted
later.</li>
<li>If creating a custom layout, create the partitions mentioned in
the previous paragraph (which the installer will require anyway),
as well as separate ones described in the following sections.</li>
</ul>
If a system has already been installed, and the default
partitioning scheme was used, it is possible but nontrivial to
modify it to create separate logical volumes for the directories
listed above. The Logical Volume Manager (LVM) makes this possible.
See the LVM HOWTO at http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/ for more
detailed information on LVM.</description>

<Rule id="partition_for_tmp">
<title>Ensure /tmp Located On Separate Partition</title>
<description>
The <tt>/tmp</tt> directory is a world-writable directory used
for temporary file storage. Ensure that it has its own partition or
logical volume.
</description>
<rationale>
The <tt>/tmp</tt> partition is used as temporary storage
by many programs.
Placing <tt>/tmp</tt> in its own partition enables the setting of more restrictive mount options, which can help protect programs which use it.

<Rule id="partition_for_var">
<title>Ensure /var Located On Separate Partition</title>
<description>The <tt>/var</tt> directory is used by daemons and other system
services to store frequently-changing data. Ensure that <tt>/var</tt> has its own partition
or logical volume.</description>
<rationale>
Ensuring that <tt>/var</tt> is mounted on its own partition enables the
setting of more restrictive mount options. This helps protect
system services such as daemons or other programs which use it.
It is not uncommon for the <tt>/var</tt> directory to contain
world-writable directories, installed by other software packages.

<description>
Audit logs are stored in the <tt>/var/log/audit</tt> directory.
Ensure that it has its own partition or logical volume. Make
absolutely certain that it is large enough to store all audit logs
that will be created by the auditing daemon.
</description>
<rationale>
Placing <tt>/var/log/audit</tt> in its own partition
enables better separation between audit files
and other files, and helps ensure that
auditing cannot be halted due to the partition running out
of space.

<Rule id="partition_for_home">
<title>Ensure /home Located On Separate Partition</title>
<description>
If user home directories will be stored locally,
create a separate partition for <tt>/home</tt>. If <tt>/home</tt> will be mounted
from another system such as an NFS server, then creating a separate
partition is not necessary at this time, and the mountpoint can
instead be configured later.
</description>
<rationale>
Ensuring that <tt>/home</tt> is mounted on its own partition enables the
setting of more restrictive mount options, and also helps ensure that
users cannot trivially fill partitions used for log or audit data storage.
