Welcome to the scap-security-guide!


========= OVERVIEW =========

The scap-security-guide project, or SSG for short, aims to deliver security guidance, baselines, and associated validation mechanisms for Red Hat Enterprise Linux. We utilize the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) to accomplish this, with specific aims to be fully compliant with SCAP Version 1.1. The SSG homepage is https://fedorahosted.org/scap-security-guide/, where you can find the latest versions, documentation, a mailing list, and FAQs.

As part of this project you'll find the following content:

(1) scap-security-guide/
Under the parent directory you will find a number of XML files which represent our XCCDF and OVAL content. These are machine readable formats of the SCAP Security Guide which can be used in your security compliance tool of choice (oscap, FirstAidKit, etc). 

(2) HTML/
This directory contains our human readable prose guides in HTML format. You can view these guides in a standard web browser and they contain practical, actionable information for system administrators. These guides not only list out the security recommendations, but also contain reasoning and a mapping back to a U.S. Government security policy where applicable. This should be your starting point to understand the content that the SSG ships.

(3) PolicyMappings/
In reviewing feedback from the user community it quickly became apparent that having a table which maps SSG recommendations back to U.S. Government policies would be incredibly helpful. Within the PolicyMappings/ directory you will find tables which link SSG recommendations back to U.S. Government policies, such as NIST 800-53 and DCID 6/3.
