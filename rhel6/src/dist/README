Welcome to the scap-security-guide!


========= OVERVIEW =========

The scap-security-guide project, or SSG for short, aims to deliver security
guidance, baselines, and associated validation mechanisms for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux. We utilize the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) to accomplish
this, with specific aims to be fully compliant with SCAP Version 1.1. The SSG
homepage is https://fedorahosted.org/scap-security-guide/, where you can find
the latest versions, documentation, a mailing list, and FAQs.

SCAP content itself consists of XML files that enable automated compliance
checking.  These are machine readable formats which can be used in your
security compliance tool of choice (oscap, FirstAidKit, etc).  These structured
formats also enable the generation of human-readable documents such as guides,
checklists, and tables.

(1) guide/
This directory contains a human-readable prose guide, in HTML format. You can 
view these guides in a standard web browser and they contain practical, actionable
information for system administrators. These guides not only list out the security
recommendations, but also contain reasoning and a mapping back to a U.S. Government
security policy where applicable. This should be your starting point to understand 
the content that the SSG ships.

(2) policymappings/
In reviewing feedback from the user community it quickly became apparent that having
a table which maps SSG recommendations back to U.S. Government policies would be
incredibly helpful. Within the policymappings/ directory you will find tables which
link SSG recommendations back to U.S. Government policies, such as NIST 800-53 and
DCID 6/3.

(3) content/
This directory contains machine-consumable files (in the XCCDF and OVAL formats)
that can be used to carry out automated compliance checks. 

(3) USGCB-submission/
This directory should contain SCAP content suitable for submission to NIST as a
United States Government Configuration Baseline.

(4) STIG-draft/
This directory should contain SCAP content suitable for submission to DISA FSO
as a STIG.
