title: 'Disable SSH Support for .rhosts Files'

description: |-
    SSH can emulate the behavior of the obsolete rsh
    command in allowing users to enable insecure access to their
    accounts via <tt>.rhosts</tt> files.
    <br /><br />
    To ensure this behavior is disabled, add or correct the
    following line in <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt>:
    <pre>IgnoreRhosts yes</pre>

rationale: |-
    SSH trust relationships mean a compromise on one host
    can allow an attacker to move trivially to other hosts.
