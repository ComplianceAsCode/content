title: 'Disable SSH Access via Empty Passwords'

description: |-
    To explicitly disallow remote login from accounts with
    empty passwords, add or correct the following line in
    <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt>:
    <pre>PermitEmptyPasswords no</pre>
    Any accounts with empty passwords should be disabled immediately, and PAM configuration
    should prevent users from being able to assign themselves empty passwords.

rationale: |-
    Configuring this setting for the SSH daemon provides additional assurance that
    remote login via SSH will require a password,
    even in the event of misconfiguration elsewhere.
