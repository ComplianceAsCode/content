title: 'Uninstal rsh Package'

description: |-
    The <tt>rsh</tt> package contains the client commands
    for the rsh services

rationale: |-
    These legacy clients contain numerous security exposures and have
    been replaced with the more secure SSH package. Even if the server is removed,
    it is best to ensure the clients are also removed to prevent users from
    inadvertently attempting to use these commands and therefore exposing
    their credentials. Note that removing the <tt>rsh</tt> package removes
    the clients for <tt>rsh</tt>,<tt>rcp</tt>, and <tt>rlogin</tt>.
