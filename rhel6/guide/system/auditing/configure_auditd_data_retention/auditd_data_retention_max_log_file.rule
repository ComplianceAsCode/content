title: 'Configure auditd Max Log File Size'

description: |-
    Determine the amount of audit data (in megabytes)
    which should be retained in each log file. Edit the file
    <tt>/etc/audit/auditd.conf</tt>. Add or modify the following line, substituting
    the correct value of <sub idref="var_auditd_max_log_file" /> for <i>STOREMB</i>:
    <pre>max_log_file = <i>STOREMB</i></pre>
    Set the value to <tt>6</tt> (MB) or higher for general-purpose systems.
    Larger values, of course,
    support retention of even more audit data.

rationale: |-
    The total storage for audit log files must be large enough to retain
    log information over the period required. This is a function of the maximum
    log file size and the number of logs retained.

ocil_clause: 'the system audit data threshold has not been properly configured'

ocil: |-
    Inspect <tt>/etc/audit/auditd.conf</tt> and locate the following line to
    determine how much data the system will retain in each audit log file:
    <tt>$ sudo grep max_log_file /etc/audit/auditd.conf</tt>
    <pre>max_log_file = 6</pre>
