title: 'Configure auditd Number of Logs Retained'

description: "Determine how many log files\n<tt>auditd</tt> should retain when it rotates logs.\nEdit the file <tt>/etc/audit/auditd.conf</tt>. Add or modify the following\nline, substituting <i>NUMLOGS</i> with the correct value of <sub idref=\"var_auditd_num_logs\" />:\n<pre>num_logs = <i>NUMLOGS</i></pre>\nSet the value to 5 for general-purpose systems. \nNote that values less than 2 result in no log rotation."

rationale: |-
    The total storage for audit log files must be large enough to retain
    log information over the period required. This is a function of the maximum log
    file size and the number of logs retained.
