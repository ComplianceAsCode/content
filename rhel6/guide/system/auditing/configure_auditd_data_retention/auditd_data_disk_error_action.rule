title: 'Configure auditd Disk Error Action on Disk Error'

description: |-
    The <tt>auditd</tt> service can be configured to take an action
    when there is a disk error.
    Edit the file <tt>/etc/audit/auditd.conf</tt>. Add or modify the following line,
    substituting <i>ACTION</i> appropriately:
    <pre>disk_error_action = <i>ACTION</i></pre>
    Set this value to <tt>single</tt> to cause the system to switch to single-user
    mode for corrective action. Acceptable values also include <tt>syslog</tt>,
    <tt>exec</tt>, <tt>single</tt>, and <tt>halt</tt>. For certain systems, the need for availability
    outweighs the need to log all actions, and a different setting should be
    determined. Details regarding all possible values for <i>ACTION</i> are described in the
    <tt>auditd.conf</tt> man page.

rationale: |-
    Taking appropriate action in case of disk errors will minimize the possibility of
    losing audit records.
