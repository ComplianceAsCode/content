title: 'Configure auditd Disk Full Action when Disk Space Is Full'

description: |-
    The <tt>auditd</tt> service can be configured to take an action
    when disk space is running low but prior to running out of space completely.
    Edit the file <tt>/etc/audit/auditd.conf</tt>. Add or modify the following line,
    substituting <i>ACTION</i> appropriately:
    <pre>disk_full_action = <i>ACTION</i></pre>
    Set this value to <tt>single</tt> to cause the system to switch to single-user
    mode for corrective action. Acceptable values also include <tt>syslog</tt>,
    <tt>exec</tt>, <tt>single</tt>, and <tt>halt</tt>. For certain systems, the need for availability
    outweighs the need to log all actions, and a different setting should be
    determined. Details regarding all possible values for <i>ACTION</i> are described in the
    <tt>auditd.conf</tt> man page.

rationale: |-
    Taking appropriate action in case of a filled audit storage volume will minimize
    the possibility of losing audit records.

    determine if the system is configured to either log to syslog,
    switch to single-user mode, execute a script,
