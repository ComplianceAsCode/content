title: 'Ensure SELinux State is Enforcing'

description: |-
    The SELinux state should be set to <tt><sub idref="var_selinux_state" /></tt> at
    system boot time.  In the file <tt>/etc/selinux/config</tt>, add or correct the
    following line to configure the system to boot into enforcing mode:
    <pre>SELINUX=<sub idref="var_selinux_state" /></pre>

rationale: |-
    Setting the SELinux state to enforcing ensures SELinux is able to confine
    potentially compromised processes to the security policy, which is designed to
    prevent them from causing damage to the system or further elevating their
    privileges.
