title: 'Configure SELinux Policy'

description: |-
    The SELinux <tt>targeted</tt> policy is appropriate for
    general-purpose desktops and servers, as well as systems in many other roles.
    To configure the system to use this policy, add or correct the following line
    in <tt>/etc/selinux/config</tt>:
    <pre>SELINUXTYPE=<sub idref="var_selinux_policy_name" /></pre>
    Other policies, such as <tt>mls</tt>, provide additional security labeling
    and greater confinement but are not compatible with many general-purpose
    use cases.

rationale: "Setting the SELinux policy to <tt>targeted</tt> or a more specialized policy\nensures the system will confine processes that are likely to be\ntargeted for exploitation, such as network or system services.\n\nNote: During the development or debugging of SELinux modules, it is common to \ntemporarily place non-production systems in <tt>permissive</tt> mode. In such \ntemporary cases, SELinux policies should be developed, and once work\nis completed, the system should be reconfigured to\n<tt><sub idref=\"var_selinux_policy_name\" /></tt>."
