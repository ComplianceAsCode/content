title: 'Disable Kernel Parameter for IPv6 Forwarding'

description: '<sysctl-desc-macro sysctl="net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding" value="0" />'

rationale: |-
    IP forwarding permits the kernel to forward packets from one network
    interface to another. The ability to forward packets between two networks is
    only appropriate for systems acting as routers.
