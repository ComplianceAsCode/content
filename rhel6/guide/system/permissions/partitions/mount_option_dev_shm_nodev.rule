title: 'Add nodev Option to /dev/shm'

description: "The <tt>nodev</tt> mount option can be used to prevent creation\nof device files in <tt>/dev/shm</tt>.\nLegitimate character and block devices should not exist\nwithin temporary directories like <tt>/dev/shm</tt>. \n<mount-desc-macro option=\"nodev\" part=\"/dev/shm\" />"

rationale: |-
    The only legitimate location for device files is the <tt>/dev</tt> directory
    located on the root partition. The only exception to this is chroot jails.
