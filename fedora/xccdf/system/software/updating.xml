<title>Updating Software</title>
<description>The <tt>dnf</tt> command line tool is used to install and
update software packages. The system also provides a graphical
software update tool in the <b>System</b> menu, in the <b>Administration</b> submenu,
called <b>Software Update</b>.
<br /><br />
Fedora systems contain an installed software catalog called
the RPM database, which records metadata of installed packages.  Tools such as
<tt>dnf</tt> or the graphical <b>Software Update</b> ensure usage of RPM
packages for software installation.  This allows for insight into the current
inventory of installed software on the system, and is highly recommended.

     ensure they have configured an update source! -->

<title>gpgcheck Enabled In Main Dnf Configuration</title>
<description>The <tt>gpgcheck</tt> option should be used to ensure
checking of an RPM package's signature always occurs prior to its
installation. To configure dnf to check package signatures before installing
them, ensure the following line appears in <tt>/etc/dnf/dnf.conf</tt> in
the <tt>[main]</tt> section:
<pre>gpgcheck=1</pre>
</description>
<ocil clause="GPG checking is not enabled">
To determine whether <tt>dnf</tt> is configured to use <tt>gpgcheck</tt>,
inspect <tt>/etc/dnf/dnf.conf</tt> and ensure the following appears in the
<tt>[main]</tt> section:
<pre>gpgcheck=1</pre>
A value of <tt>1</tt> indicates that <tt>gpgcheck</tt> is enabled. Absence of a
<tt>gpgcheck</tt> line or a setting of <tt>0</tt> indicates that it is
disabled.
</ocil>
<rationale>
Ensuring the validity of packages' cryptographic signatures prior to
installation ensures the provenance of the software and
protects against malicious tampering.
