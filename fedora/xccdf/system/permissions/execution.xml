<title>Restrict Programs from Dangerous Execution Patterns</title>
<description>The recommendations in this section are designed to
ensure that the system's features to protect against potentially
dangerous program execution are activated.
These protections are applied at the system initialization or
kernel level, and defend against certain types of badly-configured
or compromised programs.</description>

<title>Daemon Umask</title>
<description>The umask is a per-process setting which limits
the default permissions for creation of new files and directories.
The system includes initialization scripts which set the default umask
for system daemons.

<title>Set Daemon Umask</title>
<description>The file <tt>/etc/init.d/functions</tt> includes initialization
parameters for most or all daemons started at boot time.  The default umask of
022 prevents creation of group- or world-writable files.  To set the default
umask for daemons, edit the following line, inserting 022 or 027 for
<i>UMASK</i> appropriately:
<pre>umask <i><sub idref="var_umask_for_daemons" /></i></pre>
Setting the umask to too restrictive a setting can cause serious errors at
runtime.  Many daemons on the system already individually restrict themselves to
a umask of 077 in their own init scripts.
</description>
<ocil clause="it does not">
To check the value of the <tt>umask</tt>, run the following command:
<pre>$ grep umask /etc/init.d/functions</pre>
The output should show either <tt>022</tt> or <tt>027</tt>.

<rationale>The umask influences the permissions assigned to files created by a

<title>Disable Core Dumps</title>
<description>A core dump file is the memory image of an executable
program when it was terminated by the operating system due to
errant behavior. In most cases, only software developers
legitimately need to access these files. The core dump files may
also contain sensitive information, or unnecessarily occupy large
amounts of disk space.
<br /><br />
Once a hard limit is set in <tt>/etc/security/limits.conf</tt>, a
user cannot increase that limit within his or her own session. If access
to core dumps is required, consider restricting them to only
certain users or groups. See the <tt>limits.conf</tt> man page for more
information.
<br /><br />
The core dumps of setuid programs are further protected. The
<tt>sysctl</tt> variable <tt>fs.suid_dumpable</tt> controls whether
the kernel allows core dumps from these programs at all. The default
value of 0 is recommended.</description>

<Rule id="disable_users_coredumps">

<title>Enable ExecShield</title>
<description>ExecShield describes kernel features that provide
protection against exploitation of memory corruption errors such as buffer
overflows. These features include random placement of the stack and other
memory regions, prevention of execution in memory that should only hold data,
and special handling of text buffers. These protections are enabled by default
on 32-bit systems and controlled through <tt>sysctl</tt> variables
<tt>kernel.exec-shield</tt> and <tt>kernel.randomize_va_space</tt>. On the latest
64-bit systems, <tt>kernel.exec-shield</tt> cannot be enabled or disabled with

<rationale>ExecShield uses the segmentation feature on all x86 systems
to prevent execution in memory higher than a certain address. It
writes an address as a limit in the code segment descriptor, to
control where code can be executed, on a per-process basis. When
the kernel places a process's memory regions such as the stack and
heap higher than this address, the hardware prevents execution in that
address range. This is enabled by default on the latest Red Hat and Fedora
systems if supported by the hardware.</rationale>

<title>Enable Execute Disable (XD) or No Execute (NX) Support on
x86 Systems</title>
<description>Recent processors in the x86 family support the
ability to prevent code execution on a per memory page basis.
Generically and on AMD processors, this ability is called No
Execute (NX), while on Intel processors it is called Execute
Disable (XD). This ability can help prevent exploitation of buffer
overflow vulnerabilities and should be activated whenever possible.
Extra steps must be taken to ensure that this protection is
enabled, particularly on 32-bit x86 systems. Other processors, such
as Itanium and POWER, have included such support since inception
and the standard kernel for those platforms supports the
feature. This is enabled by default on the latest Red Hat and
Fedora systems if supported by the hardware.</description>

<description>Systems that are using the 64-bit x86 kernel package
do not need to install the kernel-PAE package because the 64-bit
x86 kernel already includes this support. However, if the system is
32-bit and also supports the PAE and NX features as
determined in the previous section, the kernel-PAE package should
be installed to enable XD or NX support:
<pre>$ sudo dnf install kernel-PAE</pre>
The installation process should also have configured the
bootloader to load the new kernel at boot. Verify this at reboot
and modify <tt>/etc/default/grub</tt> if necessary.</description>

installed on older systems that do not support the XD or NX bit, as
