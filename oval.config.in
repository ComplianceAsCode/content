# This file contains variables that are settings for OVAL checks such as 
# OVAL Schema version, i.e. 5.10, or the operating system version
# that the OVAL check currently supports, i.e. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.
#
# As OVAL checks support multiple operating system verions, the use of the
# multi_platform_ variables allow developers to easily specify the multiple
# operating system versions supported by a specific OVAL check. For example:
# 
#     <platform>Fedora 22</platform>
#     <platform>Fedora 23</platform>
#     <platform>Fedora 24</platform>
# 
# would be written in the OVAL check as:
#
#     <platform>multi_platform_fedora</platform>
#
# with the multi_platform_fedora variable set as the following in this file:
#
# multi_platform_fedora = 24,23,22
#
# Note: this file uses .ini style formatting
#
