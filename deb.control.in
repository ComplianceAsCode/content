Description: Security guidance and baselines in SCAP formats
 The __NAME__ project provides a guide for configuration of the
 system from the final system's security point of view. The guidance is
 specified in the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) format and
 constitutes a catalog of practical hardening advice, linked to government
 requirements where applicable. The project bridges the gap between generalized
 policy requirements and specific implementation guidelines. The system
 administrator can use the oscap command-line tool from the openscap-utils
 package to verify that the system conforms to provided guidelines.
