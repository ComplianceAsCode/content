The rules in this group are used to manage JBoss servers in a secure manner.
These rules are related to general best practices.

<Rule id="jboss_eap_configure_vcs" severity="medium">
<title>Configure Git for JBoss Maintenance and Deploayments</title>
<description>
All configuration files (such a data sources, custom connectors, etc) and any
scripts used for modifications and deployments should be stored in the version
control repository. Typical repositories include applications such as SVN or
Git.
<br /><br />
Additionally, a hash-validated 'Gold' version of the JBoss installation
package should also be stored in the version control system.
</description>
<ocil clause="it is not configured or in use">
</ocil>
<rationale>
Configuration management is an essential part long-term success for
any software application - especially for complex software or collaborative
environments. Using a versioning system allows for tighter control and
accountability of application server changes.
<br/><br/>
Maintaining a 'Gold' version of JBoss is useful for environments that may need
to periodically or dynamically deploy JBoss instances. This can also be useful
for static environments that simply desire to have a known baseline to deploy
from.
</rationale>
<fixtext><xhtml:p>Initiate a version control repository such as Git or SVN for JBoss maintenance and deployments. This will likely be a multi-stage process requiring planning and implementation.</xhtml:p> </fixtext>

<Rule id="jboss_eap_automate_deployments" severity="medium">
<title>Automate JBoss Deployments</title>
<description>
Scripts or other software tools should be used to automatically configure and
deploy JBoss applications in environments.
</description>
<ocil clause="">
</ocil>
<rationale>
As much as possible new application deployments to JBoss should be scripted.
This increases standardization in deployments and reduces the possibility of
errors and misconfigurations. Smaller environments may see less benefit from
implementing an automated process.
</rationale>
<fixtext><xhtml:p>Utilize custom scripts and/or software to automate application deployments to JBoss. Popular applications in this field include Cargo, ANT, JBoss Tools, and Hudson. Software in this category is quickly evolving and adding new features. </xhtml:p></fixtext>

<title>Ensure Application Performance Testing</title>
<description>
Ensure routine performance testing is completed before applications are
deployed to production. Establish and document performance profiles.

<ocil clause="there is no application performance testing">

<rationale>
Without adequate performance testing, production applications may fail to
perform to expectations - resulting in a denial of service.
</rationale>
<fixtext><xhtml:p>Ensure routine performance testing is completed before applications are deployed to production. Establish and document performance profiles. Attempt to test against anticipated peak demands as well as load averages. Individual tests will vary, but commonly consist of testing message throughputs (various message types), application inputs, connections open/closed/expired, data transactions completed, method calls, objects persisted, etc.</xhtml:p> </fixtext>

<Rule id="jboss_eap_enable_monitoring" severity="medium">
<title>Configure Monitoring of JBoss Servers</title>
<description>
JBoss Enterprise Application Platform servers in production environments should
be monitored real-time. Information monitored and alarm thresholds will vary.
Common monitoring tools include:
<ul>
<li>JBoss Operations Network (JON)</li>
<li>Foglight</li>
<li>HP Openview</li>
<li>Nagios</li>
</ul>
</description>
<ocil clause="JBoss is not being monitored, or monitoring is not configured">
</ocil>

Production environments should be carefully monitored to ensure the any problems
on the server are detected as quickly as possible. Identifying and isolating a
problem when it is small may prevent downtime or other problems on the network.
</rationale>
<fixtext><xhtml:p>Research and implement an appropriate monitoring solution for the production environment. Different environments will have different requirements owing to sensitivity to downtime, regulatory requirements, service agreements, and other factors. Be careful when implementing a monitoring solution to minimize performance impact on the servers where possible. Common monitoring tools include:</xhtml:p>

Software and packages should be downloaded from redhat.com, and hash validated.

Without validating downloaded files are authentic, malicious users may
compromise software before it has even been installed. Attackers may redirect
traffic to alternate download locations and attempt to trick administrators
into downloading modified software.
</rationale>
<fixtext><xhtml:p>When downloading software, first ensure it is coming from the site you expect it to. For instance, when downloading JBoss Enterprise Application Platform from Red Hat, JBoss administrators should review the X.509 certificate presented by the remote server to ensure the authenticity of the site.</xhtml:p>
<xhtml:p>Next, JBoss administrators should hash validate files after completed downloads. Hash generation will vary depending on operating system. These hashes should be compared to one of the hashes available on the Red Hat website.</xhtml:p></fixtext>

<Rule id="jboss_eap_configure_commons_criteria" severity="medium">
<title>Configure JBoss In Accordance With Common Criteria Requirements</title>
<description>
JBoss deployments in government and DoD organizations require JBoss be deployed
in a Common Criteria certified configuration. The Common Criteria configuration
is a list of technical configuration items, policy requirements, and other
configurations required to certify a JBoss installation at the EAL4+ protection
level. Red Hat maintains configuration guidance available online to assist
administrators during the installation and configuration of JBoss
(<a href="http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/index.html">http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/index.html</a>).
</description>
<ocil clause="it does not meet guidelines">
</ocil>
<rationale>
By deviating from a Common Criteria configuration, JBoss will no longer be
considered certified against any protection level - this may have legislative
or regulatory consequences that must be identified and risk assessed dependent
on your environment.
