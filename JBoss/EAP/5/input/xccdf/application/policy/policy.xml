<Rule id="jboss_eap_ensure_physical_protections" severity="high">
<title>Ensure Adequate Physical Protections</title>
<description>
The hardware and software executing JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, as well as the software critical to security policy enforcement must be protected from unauthorized modification including unauthorized modifications by potentially hostile outsiders. Reasonable physical security measures to ensure that unauthorized personnel do not have physical access to the hardware running the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform software must be implemented.
</description>
<ocil clause="there are not">
</ocil>
<rationale>
Many software security precautions can easily be bypassed by personnel with physical access to hardware storing data or executing an application.
</rationale>
		
<fixtext>
Implement reasonable physical access controls to protect the hardware running and storing information for JBoss Enterprise Application Platform. Typically, these sorts of protections will include locked doors, locked server cabinets, security alarms, cameras, door guards, etc. What is considered 'reasonable' will scale with the importance of the JBoss server and the sensitivity of the information it processes.

<description>
Java permissions for applications should be documented and carefully reviewed prior to deployment. Developers and administrators should strive to balance application permissions and application functionality.
</description>
<ocil clause="they are not">
</ocil>
<rationale>
Java permissions for deployed applications should be carefully restricted to enforce the least privilege principle. Careful documentation, along with a thorough review will help prevent needlessly insecure permission assignments for applications.

Without a comprehensive audit policy and review procedures, organizations risk missing critical events or event trends within their environment. These missed events may indicate system anomalies ranging from malicious attacks, system instabilities, system misuse, etc.

<rationale>
A consistent, cohesive access control policy is impossible to attain without a well-documented access control policy and related procedures. Failure to do so typically results in over-assignment of access permissions for users and applications, stale access for users and applications, and other access control misconfigurations that reduce the effectiveness of the security policy.

<Rule id="jboss_eap_configure_password_length" severity="medium">
<title>Configure Minimum And Maximum Password Settings</title>
<description>
Organizations should create an authenticator management policy that defines minimum and maximum password sizes for user accounts accessing JBoss and its deployed applications.
</description>
<ocil clause="password length is not defined or configured correctly">
</ocil>
<rationale>
In brute force scenarios, passwords of extended lengths increase password security and the length of time required to decrypt the password.
<br /><br />
However, there are risks associated with requiring passwords of great lengths, as users may take steps to circumvent policy; such as using repetitive passwords, writing password reminders, or writing down their passwords.
</rationale>

<fixtext>
<xhtml:p>
JBoss system administrators should work security team members to draft a comprehensive password policy. Minimum and maximum password lengths should be defined. Further, accounts may be categorized in order to define varying length requirements for particular types of accounts.
</xhtml:p>

<xhtml:p>

For example:

</xhtml:p>

<xhtml:ul>

<xhtml:li>
User accounts shall require password lengths of between 8 and 24 characters
</xhtml:li>

<xhtml:li>
Administrator shall require password lengths of 24 characters
</xhtml:li>

<xhtml:li>
Web service accounts shall require password lengths of 24 characters

<Rule id="jboss_eap_password_complexity" severity="medium">
<title>Configure Password Complexity</title>
<description>
Organizations should create an authenticator management policy that defines a minimum level of complexity for user accounts accessing JBoss and its deployed applications. These requirements should also restrict passwords from containing dictionary words and reusing previous passwords.
</description>
<ocil clause="password complexity is too week or not configured correctly">
</ocil>
<rationale>
Complex passwords increase password security and the length of time required to decrypt the password. Additionally, complex passwords are less likely to be found in password dictionaries.
<br /><br />
However, there are risks associated with requiring overly complex passwords, as users may take steps to circumvent policy; such as using repetitive passwords, writing password reminders, or writing down their passwords.
</rationale>

<fixtext>
<xhtml:p>
JBoss system administrators should work security team members to draft a comprehensive password policy. Password complexity requirements should be defined. The policy should not allow passwords to be reused or contain dictionary words. Further, accounts may be categorized in order to define varying complexity requirements for particular types of accounts.
</xhtml:p>

<xhtml:p>

For example:

</xhtml:p>

<xhtml:ul>

<xhtml:li>
User accounts shall require passwords containing at least 1 lowercase alphanumeric character, 1 uppercase alphanumeric character, and 1 number
</xhtml:li>

<xhtml:li>
Administrator accounts shall require passwords containing at least 2 lowercase alphanumeric characters, 2 uppercase alphanumeric characters, 2 numbers, and 2 special characters. Special characters include: !@#$%^&amp;*()

<title>Configure Password Expiration Interval</title>
<description>
Organizations should create an authenticator management policy that defines a maximum password age for user accounts accessing JBoss and its deployed applications.
</description>
<ocil clause="password expiration is not configured or not configured correctly">
</ocil>
<rationale>
In combination with password length and complexity, regularly changing passwords can defeat many attacks. If a password or password hash is intercepted by a malicious party, changing the password can remove access or render invalid a cracking attempt on the hash.
<br /><br />
However, there are risks associated with frequently changing passwords. Users may take steps to circumvent policy such as using repetitive passwords or using password derivatives. Additionally, changing passwords for system or application accounts introduces an element of configuration risk. Poorly coordinated or documented changes can result in system outages or create other problems.
