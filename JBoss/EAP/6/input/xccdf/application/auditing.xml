	<Rule id="jboss_roll_over_transfer_logs" severity="medium">
		<title>JBoss servers must be configured to roll over and transfer logs on a minimum weekly basis.</title>
		<description>Information stored in one location is vulnerable to accidental or incidental deletion or
			alteration. Protecting log data is important during a forensic investigation to ensure 
			investigators can track and understand what may have occurred. Off-loading should be set up 
			as a scheduled task but can be configured to be run manually, if other processes during 
			the off-loading are manual. Off-loading is a common process in information systems with 
			limited log storage capacity.</description>
