description: |-
    If the system is joined to the Red Hat Network, a Red Hat Satellite Server,
    or a yum server, run the following command to install updates:
    <pre>$ sudo yum update</pre>
    If the system is not configured to use one of these sources, updates (in the form of RPM packages)
    can be manually downloaded and installed using <tt>rpm</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Running an older version of Webmin can introduce security
    vulnerabilities to the system.
