title: 'Use passwd for changing passwords'

description: |-
    Webmin must use passwd for password changes so that password requirements configured in the operating system are 
    enforced on new password selections.

    To check that Webmin settings are configured correctly, you have to examine the config file
    available under <tt>/etc/webmin/config</tt>.
    If this config file contains the line <tt>passwd_cmd=/usr/bin/passwd</tt>,
    password changes will be enforced through the passwd utility.

rationale: |-
    The default mechanism for changing a user's password does not enforce password restricitions consistent with those 
    provided by the operating system.

severity: unknown

ocil_clause: |-
    the <pre>config</pre> doesn't contain the <pre>passwd_cmd=/usr/bin/passwd</pre> line

ocil: |-
    To verify that Webmin uses passwd, check the respective Webmin config file
    <pre>/etc/webmin/config</pre> contains the <pre>passwd_cmd=/usr/bin/passwd</pre> line:
    <pre>grep 'passwd_cmd=/usr/bin/passwd' /etc/webmin/config</pre>.
