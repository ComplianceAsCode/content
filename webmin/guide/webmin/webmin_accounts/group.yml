title: 'Webmin Accounts'

description: |-
    Webmin provides the ability to manage how users authenticate to the system.
    While it provides its own mechanisms for supporting authentication, it also 
    supports alternate mechanisms, such as the Password Authentication Module (PAM)
    commonly used within Linux.
