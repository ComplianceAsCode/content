title: 'Enable the ability for a user to change an expired password'

description: |-
    Webmin must enable a user to change their password when	it has expired.

    To check that Webmin settings are configured correctly, you have to examine the config file
    available under <tt>/etc/webmin/miniserv.conf</tt>.
    If this config file contains the line <tt>passwd_mode=2</tt>,
    a user is prompted to change their password when it expires.

rationale: |-
    Users need the ability to be prompted to change their password when it expires.

severity: unknown

ocil_clause: |-
    the <pre>miniserv.conf</pre> doesn't contain the <pre>passwd_mode=2</pre> line

ocil: |-
    To verify that Webmin prompts a user to change their password when it expires, 
    check the respective Webmin config file
    <pre>/etc/webmin/miniserv.conf</pre> contains the <pre>passwd_mode=2</pre> line:
    <pre>grep 'passwd_mode=2' /etc/webmin/miniserv.conf</pre>.
