title: 'Display approved login banner prior to login'

description: |-
    Webmin must present a login banner prior to allowing authentication. This informs the end user
    of any legal and organizational requirements enforced by accessing the system and provides them 
    an opportunity to exit or agree to the requirements and proceed with authentication.

    To check that Webmin settings are configured correctly, you have to examine the config file
    available under <tt>/etc/webmin/config</tt>.
    If this config file contains the line <tt>loginbanner=/etc/webmin/login_banner</tt>,
    a user is prompted with a login banner.

rationale: |-
    Organizations must convey access requirements to the end user prior to allowing authentication.

severity: unknown

ocil_clause: |-
    the <pre>config</pre> doesn't contain the <pre>loginbanner=/etc/webmin/login_banner</pre> line

ocil: |-
    To verify that Webmin prompts a user to change their password when it expires, 
    check the respective Webmin config file
    <pre>/etc/webmin/miniserv.conf</pre> contains the <pre>passwd_mode=2</pre> line:
    <pre>grep 'passwd_mode=2' /etc/webmin/miniserv.conf</pre>.
