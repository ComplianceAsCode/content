title: 'Encryption is enabled and enforced'

description: |-
    Webmin must enable session encryption and force redirection from an unencrypted connection to an encrypted connection.

    To check that Webmin settings are configured correctly, you have to examine the config file
    available under <tt>/etc/webmin/miniserv.conf</tt>.
    If this config file contains the lines <tt>ssl=1</tt> and <tt>ssl_redirect=1</tt>,
    a user is prompted to change their password when it expires.

rationale: |-
    Session encryption ensures the authentication credentials and actions performed are protected from being revealed to attackers.

severity: unknown

ocil_clause: |-
    the <pre>miniserv.conf</pre> doesn't contain the <pre>passwd_mode=2</pre> line

ocil: |-
    To verify that Webmin enforces session encryption, 
    check the respective Webmin config file
    <pre>/etc/webmin/miniserv.conf</pre> contains the <tt>ssl=1</tt> and <tt>ssl_redirect=1</tt> lines:
    <pre>grep 'ssl=1' /etc/webmin/miniserv.conf</pre>.
    <pre>grep 'ssl_redirect=1' /etc/webmin/miniserv.conf</pre>.
