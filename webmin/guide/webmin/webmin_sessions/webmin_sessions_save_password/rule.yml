title: 'Prevent the ability for a user to save their login credentials for future access'

description: |-
    Webmin must prevent users from saving their credentials in the browser.

    To check that Webmin settings are configured correctly, you have to examine the config file
    available under <tt>/etc/webmin/config</tt>.
    If this config file contains the line <tt>noremember=1</tt>,
    a user is prevented from selecting the checkbox to save their password.

rationale: |-
    Passwords saved in the browser are susceptible to being disclosed by an attacker.

severity: unknown
