title: 'Logs must not be accessible to unauthorized users'

description: |-
    Webmin must only allow access to the logs by authorized administrators.

    To check that Webmin settings are configured correctly, you have to examine the config file
    available under <tt>/etc/webmin/miniserv.conf</tt>.
    If this config file contains the line <tt>logperms=640</tt>,
    logs are restricted to read/write access by its owner and read-only access by its group.
    All other access is denied.

rationale: |-
    Logs need to be protected from unauthorized access.

severity: unknown

ocil_clause: |-
    the <pre>miniserv.conf</pre> doesn't contain the <pre>logperms=640</pre> line

ocil: |-
    To verify that Webmin protects the logs from unauthorized access, 
    check the respective Webmin config file
    <pre>/etc/webmin/miniserv.conf</pre> contains the <pre>logperms=640</pre> line:
    <pre>grep 'logperms=640' /etc/webmin/miniserv.conf</pre>.
