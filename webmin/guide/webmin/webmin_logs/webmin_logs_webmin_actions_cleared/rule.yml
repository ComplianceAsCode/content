title: 'Prevent users from covering their actions performed'

description: |-
    Webmin must prevent users from clearing the log.

    To check that Webmin settings are configured correctly, you have to examine the config file
    available under <tt>/etc/webmin/config</tt>.
    If this config file contains the line <tt>logclear=0</tt>,
    a user is prevented from clearing the log.

rationale: |-
    Users can cover their tracks by removing logs that record their actions within the system.

severity: unknown

ocil_clause: |-
    the <pre>config</pre> doesn't contain the <pre>logclear=0</pre> line

ocil: |-
    To verify that Webmin prevents users from clearing the log, 
    check the respective Webmin config file
    <pre>/etc/webmin/config</pre> contains the <pre>logclear=0</pre> line:
    <pre>grep 'logclear=0' /etc/webmin/config</pre>.
