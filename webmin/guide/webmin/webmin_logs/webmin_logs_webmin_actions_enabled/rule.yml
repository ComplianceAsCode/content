title: 'Log actions performed by users'

description: |-
    Webmin must enable logging of user actions in the Web interface.

    To check that Webmin settings are configured correctly, you have to examine the config file
    available under <tt>/etc/webmin/config</tt>.
    If this config file contains the line <tt>log=1</tt>,
    user actions are being recorded.

rationale: |-
    User actions need to be recorded to identify any malicious use of the software by a user.

severity: unknown

ocil_clause: |-
    the <pre>config</pre> doesn't contain the <pre>log=1</pre> line

ocil: |-
    To verify that Webmin records user actions, 
    check the respective Webmin config file
    <pre>/etc/webmin/config</pre> contains the <pre>log=1</pre> line:
    <pre>grep 'log=1' /etc/webmin/config</pre>.
