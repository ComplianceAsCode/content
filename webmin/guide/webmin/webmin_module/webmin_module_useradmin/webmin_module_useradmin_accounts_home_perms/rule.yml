title: 'Configure new accounts to create their home directory with a default permission setting of 750'

description: |-
    New users created through the UserAdmin Webmin module must have the default permissions of 750 
    applied to their home directory when created.

    To check that Webmin settings are configured correctly, you have to examine the config file
    available under <tt>/etc/webmin/useradmin/config</tt>.
    If this config file contains the line <tt>homedir_perms=0750</tt>,
    a user's home directory will be created with the default permissions of 750.

rationale: |-
    User home directories should be created with permissions that prevent other users on the system from accessing their data.

severity: unknown

ocil_clause: |-
    the <pre>config</pre> doesn't contain the <pre>homedir_perms=0750</pre> line

ocil: |-
    To verify that user home directories are created with the required permissions, 
    check the respective Webmin config file
    <pre>/etc/webmin/useradmin/config</pre> contains the <pre>homedir_perms=0750</pre> line:
    <pre>grep 'homedir_perms=0750' /etc/webmin/useradmin/config</pre>.
