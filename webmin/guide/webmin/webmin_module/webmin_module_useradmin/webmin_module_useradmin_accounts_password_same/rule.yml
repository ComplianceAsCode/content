title: 'Configure the UserAdmin Webmin module to require passwords to be different from the previously configured password'

description: |-
    Passwords created through the UserAdmin Webmin module must not be the same as the previous password used.

    To check that Webmin settings are configured correctly, you have to examine the config file
    available under <tt>/etc/webmin/useradmin/config</tt>.
    If this config file contains the line <tt>passwd_same=1</tt>,
    a user is prevented from using their previous password as their new password.

rationale: |-
    User passwords need to meet organizational requirements for complexity.

severity: unknown

ocil_clause: |-
    the <pre>config</pre> doesn't contain the <pre>passwd_same=1</pre> line

ocil: |-
    To verify that Webmin prevents users from using their previous password as their new password, 
    check the respective Webmin config file
    <pre>/etc/webmin/useradmin/config</pre> contains the <pre>passwd_same=1</pre> line:
    <pre>grep 'passwd_same=1' /etc/webmin/useradmin/config</pre>.
