title: 'Configure new accounts to prevent changing passwords more than once per the minimum number of days defined'

description: |-
    New users created through the UserAdmin Webmin module must include required minimum password life criteria.

    To check that Webmin settings are configured correctly, you have to examine the config file
    available under <tt>/etc/webmin/useradmin/config</tt>.
    If this config file contains the line <tt>default_min=1</tt>,
    a user is prevented from changing their password more than once a day.

rationale: |-
    User passwords need to meet organizational requirements for complexity.

severity: unknown
