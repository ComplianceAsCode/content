title: 'Configure the UserAdmin Webmin module to require passwords to not include dictionary words'

description: |-
    Passwords created through the UserAdmin Webmin module must not include dictionary words.

    To check that Webmin settings are configured correctly, you have to examine the config file
    available under <tt>/etc/webmin/useradmin/config</tt>.
    If this config file contains the line <tt>passwd_dict=1</tt>,
    passwords are checked against a dictionary to prevent simple known passwords from being used.

rationale: |-
    User passwords need to meet organizational requirements for complexity.

severity: unknown

ocil_clause: |-
    the <pre>config</pre> doesn't contain the <pre>passwd_dict=1</pre> line

ocil: |-
    To verify that Webmin requires users passwords to not include words from a dictionary, 
    check the respective Webmin config file
    <pre>/etc/webmin/useradmin/config</pre> contains the <pre>passwd_dict=1</pre> line:
    <pre>grep 'passwd_dict=1' /etc/webmin/useradmin/config</pre>.
