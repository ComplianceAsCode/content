title: 'Configure the UserAdmin Webmin module to require a minimum number of characters in passwords defined'

description: |-
    Passwords created through the UserAdmin Webmin module must include the minimum defined number of characters in the password.

    To check that Webmin settings are configured correctly, you have to examine the config file
    available under <tt>/etc/webmin/useradmin/config</tt>.
    If this config file contains the line <tt>passwd_min=14</tt>,
    a user is required to have at least 14 characters in their password.

rationale: |-
    User passwords need to meet organizational requirements for complexity.

severity: unknown

ocil_clause: |-
    the <pre>config</pre> doesn't contain the <pre>passwd_min=14</pre> line

ocil: |-
    To verify that Webmin requires users to have a minimum of 14 characters in their password, 
    check the respective Webmin config file
    <pre>/etc/webmin/useradmin/config</pre> contains the <pre>passwd_min=14</pre> line:
    <pre>grep 'passwd_min=14' /etc/webmin/useradmin/config</pre>.
