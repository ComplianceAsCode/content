The best protection against vulnerable software is running less software. This section describes how to review
the software which Red Hat Enterprise Linux installs on a system and disable software which is not needed. It
then enumerates the software packages installed on a default RHEL6 system and provides guidance about which
ones can be safely disabled.

RHEL6 provides a convenient minimal install option that essentially installs the bare necessities for a functional
system. When building RHEL6 servers it is highly recommended to select the minimal packages and then build up
the system from there.
