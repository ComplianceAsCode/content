title: 'Disable All Plugins by Default'

description: "Plugins are developed internally or by third party sources and are designed to extend\nGoogle Chromium's functionality. All plugins should be blacklisted from \ninstallation by default. To blacklist all plugins set <tt>DisabledPlugins</tt>\nto <tt>*</tt> in the Chromium policy file."

rationale: |-
    Plugins can access almost anything on a system and users can enable or install them
    at will. This means they pose a high risk to any system that would allow all plugins
    to be installed by default.

severity: unknown

ocil_clause: 'they are not disabled'

ocil: |-
    To verify that all plugins are blacklisted, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep DisabledPlugins /etc/chromium/policies/managed/*.json</pre>
    The output should contain:
    <pre>"DisabledPlugins": ["*"],</pre>
