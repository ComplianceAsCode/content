title: 'Disable Insecure And Obsolete Protocol Schemas'

description: |-
    Each access to a URL is handled by the browser according to the URL's "scheme".
    The "scheme" of a URL is the section before the ":". The term "protocol" is often
    mistakenly used for a "scheme". The difference is that the scheme is how the browser
    handles a URL and the protocol is how the browser communicates with a service. To
    disable insecure and obsolete protocol schema, set <tt>URLBlacklist</tt> to
    <tt><sub idref="var_url_blacklist" /></tt> in the Chromium policy file.

rationale: |-
    If a scheme or its associated protocol used by a browser is insecure or obsolete,
    vulnerabilities can be exploited resulting in exposed data or unrestricted access
    to the browser's system.

ocil: |-
    To verify that data synchronization is disabled, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep URLBlacklist /etc/chromium/policies/managed/*.json</pre>
    The output should contain:
    <pre>"URLBlacklist": ["<sub idref="var_url_blacklist" />"],</pre>
