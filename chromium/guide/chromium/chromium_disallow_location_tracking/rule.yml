title: 'Disable Location Tracking'

description: "Location tracking is enabled by default and can track user's browsing habits.\nLocation tracking should be disabled by setting <tt>DefaultGeolocationSetting</tt> \nto <tt>2</tt> in the Chromium policy file."

rationale: "Website tracking is the practice of gathering information as to which websites\nwere accesses by a browser. The common method of doing this is to have a website\ncreate a tracking cookie on the browser. If the information of what sites are\nbeing accessed is made available to unauthorized persons, this violates \nconfidentiality requirements, and over time poses a significant OPSEC issue."
