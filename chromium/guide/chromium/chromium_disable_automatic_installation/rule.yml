title: 'Disable Automatic Search And Installation of Plugins'

description: |-
    Chromium will automatically detect, search, and install plugins as required. This
    should be disabled by setting <tt>DisablePluginFinder</tt> to <tt>true</tt> in the
    Chromium policy file.

rationale: |-
    The automatic search and installation of missing or not installed plugins should be
    disabled as this can cause significant risk if a unapproved or vulnerable plugin were
    to be installed without proper permissions or authorization.

severity: unknown

    stigid: DTBC0036

ocil_clause: 'it is not disabled'

ocil: |-
    To verify that plugins cannot be automatically installed, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep DisablePluginFinder /etc/chromium/policies/managed/*.json</pre>
    The output should contain:
    <pre>"DisablePluginFinder": true,</pre>
