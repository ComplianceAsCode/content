title: 'Require Outdated Plugins to be Authorized'

description: |-
    Chromium should prompt users for authorization to run outdated plugins. This
    can be enabled by setting <tt>AlwaysAuthorizePlugins</tt> to <tt>false</tt>
    in the Chromium policy file.

rationale: |-
    Outdated plugins can compromise security and should request authorization from
    the user before running.

severity: unknown

ocil: |-
    To verify that plugins require authorization to run, run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep AlwaysAuthorizePlugins /etc/chromium/policies/managed/*.json</pre>
    The output should contain:
    <pre>"AlwaysAuthorizePlugins": false,</pre>
