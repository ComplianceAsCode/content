title: 'Disable Data Synchronization to Google'

description: '<tt>SyncDisabled</tt> to <tt>true</tt> in the Chromium policy file.'

rationale: |-
    Google Sync is used to sync information between different user devices,
    this data is then stored on Google owned servers. The synced data may consist
    of information such as email, calendars, viewing history, etc. This feature must
    be disabled because the organization does not have control over the servers the
    data is stored on.
