title: 'Minimize Software to Minimize Vulnerability'

description: |-
    The simplest way to avoid vulnerabilities in software is to avoid
    installing that software. {{{ full_name }}}
    allows for careful management of
    the set of software packages installed on a system. Installed software
    contributes to system vulnerability in several ways. Packages that
    include setuid programs may provide local attackers a potential path to
    privilege escalation. Packages that include network services may give
    this opportunity to network-based attackers. Packages that include
    programs which are predictably executed by local users (e.g. after
    graphical login) may provide opportunities for trojan horses or other
    attack code to be run undetected. The number of software packages
    installed on a system can almost always be significantly pruned to include
    only the software for which there is an environmental or operational need.
