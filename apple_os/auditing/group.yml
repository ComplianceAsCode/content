title: 'System Accounting with audit'

description: |-
    The Basic Security Module (BSM) security audit API and file format is Apple's
    auditing system. The audit() function submits a record to the kernel for inclusion in the
    global audit trail. The record must already be in BSM format. To protect
    the integrity of the audit trail, this system call must be made with sufficient
    privileges. Libbsm can be used to create and manipulate BSM data. Length
    is the length in bytes of the BSM record and record points to the data.
    The audit service provides substantial capabilities for recording system
    activities. Secure networks often have substantial auditing
    requirements, and <tt>auditd</tt> can be configured to meet these
    requirements.
