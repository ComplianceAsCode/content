title: "Shutdown System When Auditing Failures Occur"

description: |-
    The macOS system must shut down by default upon audit
    failure unless availability is an overriding concern.

rationale: |-
    The audit service should shut down the computer if it 
    is unable to audit system events. Once audit failure
    occurs, user and system activity is no longer recorded
    and malicious activity could go undetected. Audit
    processing failures include software/hardware errors,
    failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit
    storage capacity being reached or exceeded. Responses
    to audit failure depend on the nature of the failure
    mode.

    To verify that auditing is enabled and running, run the
    following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep -E "^policy.*ahlt" /etc/security/audit_control</pre>
    The output should contain <tt>ahlt</tt>

#check:
#  /usr/bin/grep -Ec "^policy.*ahlt" /etc/security/audit_control
