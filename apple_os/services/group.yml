    The best protection against vulnerable software is running less software. This section describes how to review
    the software which {{{ full_name }}} installs on a system and disable software which is not needed. It
    then enumerates the software packages installed on a default {{{ full_name }}} system and provides guidance about which
    ones can be safely disabled.
    <br /><br />
    {{{ full_name }}} provides a convenient minimal install option that essentially installs the bare necessities for a functional
    system. When building {{{ full_name }}} systems, it is highly recommended to select the minimal packages and then build up
    the system from there.
