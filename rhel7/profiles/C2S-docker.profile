title: 'C2S for Docker'

description: |-
    This profile demonstrates compliance against the
    U.S. Government Commercial Cloud Services (C2S) baseline.

    This baseline was inspired by the Center for Internet Security
    (CIS) Docker Community Edition Benchmark, v1.1.0 - 07-06-2017.

    For the SCAP Security Guide project to remain in compliance with
    CIS' terms and conditions, specifically Restrictions(8), note
    there is no representation or claim that the C2S profile will
    ensure a system is in compliance or consistency with the CIS
    baseline.
