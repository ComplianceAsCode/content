<description override="true">
The HIPAA Security Rule establishes U.S. national standards to protect individuals’
electronic personal health information that is created, received, used, or
maintained by a covered entity. The Security Rule requires appropriate
administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the
confidentiality, integrity, and security of electronic protected health
information.

This profile configures Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 to the HIPAA Security
Rule identified for securing of electronic protected health information.
