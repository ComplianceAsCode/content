# format:
# <mount_point>,<mount_option>[,create_fstab_entry_if_needed,<fileystem>,<type>]
# - mount point mounted with specified option. for more than
#     one option, use multiple lines with the same <mount_point>, use the 
#     variable name (i.e. name beginning with var_, without the leading
#     '$' to reference a variable, e.g. var_removable_partition,nodev)
#  If the remediation can create (i.e. not just modify) an /etc/fstab line,
#  add the 'create_fstab_entry_if_needed' literal string as the third argument,
#  followed by filesystem and type of the mount_point.

# /dev/shm is created by systemd and is not available at install time
# /dev/shm may not be in /etc/fstab, add entry if needed
