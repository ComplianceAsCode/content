The upstream STIG for any STIG profile the SCAP Security Guide project is
developed under the DoD consensus model and DISA FSO Vendor STIG process,
serving as the upstream development environment for Red Hat Product STIGS.

As a result of the upstream/downstream relationship between the SCAP Security
Guide project and the official DISA FSO STIG baseline, users should expect
variance between SSG and DISA FSO content. For official DISA FSO STIG content,
refer to https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/.

While this profile is packaged by Red Hat as part of the SCAP Security Guide
package, please note that commercial support of this SCAP content is NOT
available. This profile is provided as example SCAP content with no endorsement
for suitability or production readiness. Support for this profile is provided
by the upstream SCAP Security Guide community on a best-effort basis. The
upstream project homepage is https://www.open-scap.org/security-policies/scap-security-guide/.
