The best protection against vulnerable software is running less software. This section describes how to review
the software which <product-name-macro/> installs on a system and disable software which is not needed. It
then enumerates the software packages installed on a default <product-name-macro/> system and provides guidance about which
ones can be safely disabled.
<br /><br />
<product-name-macro/> provides a convenient minimal install option that essentially installs the bare necessities for a functional
system. When building <product-name-macro/> systems, it is highly recommended to select the minimal packages and then build up
the system from there.
