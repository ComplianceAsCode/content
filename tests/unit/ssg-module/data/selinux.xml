  <ns0:title>SELinux</ns0:title>
  <ns0:description>SELinux is a feature of the Linux kernel which can be
used to guard against misconfigured or compromised programs.
SELinux enforces the idea that programs should be limited in what
files they can access and what actions they can take.
<html:br/><html:br/>
The default SELinux policy, as configured on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, has been
sufficiently developed and debugged that it should be usable on
almost any system with minimal configuration and a small
amount of system administrator training. This policy prevents
system services - including most of the common network-visible
services such as mail servers, FTP servers, and DNS servers - from
accessing files which those services have no valid reason to
access. This action alone prevents a huge amount of possible damage
from network attacks against services, from trojaned software, and
so forth.
<html:br/><html:br/>
This guide recommends that SELinux be enabled using the
default (targeted) policy on every Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 system, unless that
system has unusual requirements which make a stronger policy
appropriate.</ns0:description>
