    title: Minimization of configuration
    description: >-
      The features configured at the level of launched services
      should be limited to the strict minimum.
    rationale: >-
        Minimization of configuration helps to reduce attack surface.
    automated: no
    notes: >-
      This is individual depending on the system workload
      therefore needs to be audited manually.

        title: The product must provide automated mechanisms for supporting account management functions.
        status: does not meet
        fixtext: There is no fixtext.
        check: There is no check.
        mitigation: |-
            Mitigate with third-party software.

            Although the listed mitigation is supporting the security function, it is not sufficient to reduce the residual risk of this requirement.
        description:
          The operating system must provide automated mechanisms for supporting account management functions.
        rationale:
          Enterprise environments make account management challenging and complex.
          A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential oversight or other errors.
        status_justification:
          Mitigate with third-party software.
