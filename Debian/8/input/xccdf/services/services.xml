The best protection against vulnerable software is running less software. This
section describes how to review the software which Fedora installs on a system
and disable software which is not needed. It then enumerates the software
packages installed on a default Fedora system and provides guidance about which
ones can be safely disabled.

Fedora provides a convenient minimal install option that essentially installs
the bare necessities for a functional system. When building Fedora servers, it
is highly recommended to select the minimal packages and then build up the
system from there.
