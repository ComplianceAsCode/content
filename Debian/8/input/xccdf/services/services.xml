<description>
The following sections contain information on security-relevant choices about
software services that may be installed or blacklisted on your system.<br />
Installed services can be secured in two ways:<br />
<ul><li>
Making them accessible only from where they need to be
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
Configuring them properly, so that they can be used only in a legitimate way, without divulgating any unecessary information on the system
</li></ul>
