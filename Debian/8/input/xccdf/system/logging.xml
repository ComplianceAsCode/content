<title>Configure Syslog</title>
<description>The syslog service has been the default Unix logging mechanism for
many years. It has a number of downsides, including inconsistent log format,
lack of authentication for received messages, and lack of authentication,
encryption, or reliable transport for messages sent over a network. However,
due to its long history, syslog is a de facto standard which is supported by
almost all Unix applications.
<br/>
<br/>
In Debian Jessie, rsyslog has replaced syslog as the syslog daemon of choice,
and it includes some additional security features such as reliable,
connection-oriented (i.e. TCP) transmission of logs, the option to log to
database formats, and the encryption of log data en route to
a central logging server. This section discusses how to configure rsyslog for
best effect, and how to use tools provided with the system to maintain and
monitor logs.</description>

<description>
The file <tt>/etc/rsyslog.conf</tt> controls where log message are written.
These are controlled by lines called <i>rules</i>, which consist of a
<i>selector</i> and an <i>action</i>.
These rules are often customized depending on the role of the system, the
requirements of the environment, and whatever may enable
the administrator to most effectively make use of log data.
The default rules in Debian 8 are:

<Group id="rsyslog_sending_messages">
<title>Rsyslog Logs Sent To Remote Host</title>
<description>
If system logs are to be useful in detecting malicious
activities, it is necessary to send logs to a remote server. An
intruder who has compromised the root account on a machine may
delete the log entries which indicate that the system was attacked
before they are seen by an administrator.
<br /><br />
However, it is recommended that logs be stored on the local
host in addition to being sent to the loghost, especially if
<tt>rsyslog</tt> has been configured to use the UDP protocol to send
messages over a network. UDP does not guarantee reliable delivery,
and moderately busy sites will lose log messages occasionally,
especially in periods of high traffic which may be the result of an
attack. In addition, remote <tt>rsyslog</tt> messages are not
authenticated in any way by default, so it is easy for an attacker to
introduce spurious messages to the central log server. Also, some
problems cause loss of network connectivity, which will prevent the
sending of messages to the central server. For all of these reasons, it is
better to store log messages both centrally and on each host, so
that they can be correlated if necessary.</description>

<Rule id="rsyslog_remote_loghost">
<title>Ensure Logs Sent To Remote Host</title>
<description>
To configure rsyslog to send logs to a remote log server,
open <tt>/etc/rsyslog.conf</tt> and read and understand the last section of the file,
which describes the multiple directives necessary to activate remote
logging.
Along with these other directives, the system can be configured
to forward its logs to a particular log server by
adding or correcting one of the following lines,
substituting <tt><i>loghost.example.com</i></tt> appropriately.
The choice of protocol depends on the environment of the system; 
although TCP and RELP provide more reliable message delivery, 
they may not be supported in all environments.
<br/>
To use UDP for log message delivery:
<pre>*.* @<i>loghost.example.com</i></pre>
<br/>
To use TCP for log message delivery:
<pre>*.* @@<i>loghost.example.com</i></pre>
<br/>
To use RELP for log message delivery:
