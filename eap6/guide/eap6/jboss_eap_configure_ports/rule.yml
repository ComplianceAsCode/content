rationale: |-
    Some networking protocols may not meet organizational security requirements to
    protect data and components.
    <br /><br />
    Application servers natively host a number of
    various features, such as management interfaces, httpd servers and message
    queues. These features all run on TCPIP ports. This creates the potential that
    the vendor may choose to utilize port numbers or network services that have been
    deemed unusable by the organization. The application server must have the
    capability to both reconfigure and disable the assigned ports without adversely
    impacting application server operation capabilities.

    Review the configured ports and
    determine if they are all approved by the PPSM CAL.
    <br /><br />
    If all the ports are not
    approved by the PPSM CAL, this is a finding.
