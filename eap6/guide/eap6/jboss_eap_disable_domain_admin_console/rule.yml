title: 'Disable Network Access to the Admin Console'

description: |-
    Run the <pre>&lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/bin/jboss-clii</pre> command line interface utility.
    Connect to
    the JBoss server and run the following command.
    <pre>/core-service=management/management-interface=httpinterface/:write-attribute(name=console-enabled,value.)</pre>
    <br /><br />
    Successful command execution returns
    <pre>{"outcome" =&gt; success"}</pre>,
    and future attempts to access the management console via web
    browser at <tt><i>SERVERNAME</i>:9990</tt> will result in no access to the admin console.

rationale: |-
    When configuring JBoss application servers into a domain configuration, HTTP
    management capabilities are not required on domain member servers as management
    is done via the server that has been designated as the domain controller.
    Leaving HTTP management capabilities enabled on domain member servers increases
    the attack surfaces; therefore, management services on domain member servers
    must be disabled and management services performed via the domain
    controller.

ocil: |-
    Log on to each of the JBoss domain member servers.
    <br /><br />
    Note: Sites that manage
    systems using the JBoss Operations Network client require HTTP interface access.
    It is acceptable that the management console alone be disabled rather than
    disabling the entire interface itself.
    <br /><br />
    Run the <pre>&lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/bin/jboss-cli</pre>
    command line interface utility and connect to the JBoss server.
    Run the
    following command:
    <pre>ls /core-service=management/management-interface=httpinterface/</pre>
    <br /><br />
    If <pre>console-enabled=true</pre>, this is a finding.
