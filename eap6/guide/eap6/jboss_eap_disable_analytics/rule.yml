    Using the EAP web console, log on using admin credentials.
    On the bottom right-hand side of the screen, select <tt>Settings</tt>,
    uncheck the <tt>Enable Data Usage Collection</tt> box, and save the
    configuration.

rationale: |-
    The Google Analytics feature aims to help Red Hat EAP team understand how
    customers are using the console and which parts of the console matter the most
    to the customers. This information will, in turn, help the team to adapt the
    console design, features, and content to the immediate needs of the customers.
    Sending analytical data to the vendor introduces risk of unauthorized data
    exfiltration. This capability must be disabled.
