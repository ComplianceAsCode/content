title: 'Configure Multi-Factor Authentication'

description: |-
    Configure the application server to authenticate privileged users via
    multifactor/certificate-based authentication mechanisms when using network
    access to the management interface.

rationale: |-
    Multifactor authentication creates a layered defense and makes it more
    difficult for an unauthorized person to access the application server. If one
    factor is compromised or broken, the attacker still has at least one more
    barrier to breach before successfully breaking into the target. Unlike a simple
    username/password scenario where the attacker could gain access by knowing both
    the username and password without the user knowing his account was compromised,
    multifactor authentication adds the requirement that the attacker must have
    something from the user, such as a token, or to biometrically be the user.
    Multifactor authentication is defined as: using two or more factors to achieve
    authentication.
    <br /><br />
    Factors include:
    (i) something a user knows (e.g.,
    password/PIN);
    (ii) something a user has (e.g., cryptographic identification
    device, token); or
    (iii) something a user is (e.g., biometric). A CAC or PKI
    Hardware Token meets this definition.
    <br /><br />
    A privileged account is defined as an
    information system account with authorizations of a privileged user. These
    accounts would be capable of accessing the web management interface.
    <br /><br />
    When
    accessing the application server via a network connection, administrative access
    to the application server must be PKI Hardware Token enabled or a DoD-approved
    soft certificate.

    Log on to the OS of the JBoss server with OS permissions that allow access to
    JBoss.
    Using the relevant OS commands and syntax, cd to the <tt>&lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/bin/</tt>
    folder.
    Run the <pre>jboss-cli</pre> script.
    Connect to the server and authenticate.
    Follow these steps:
    1. Identify the security realm assigned to the management
    interfaces by using the following command:
    <br /><br />
    For standalone systems:
    <pre>ls /core-service=management/management-interface=<i>INTERFACE-NAME</i></pre>
    <br /><br />
    For
    managed domain systems:
    <pre>ls /host=master/core-service=management/management-interface=<i>INTERFACE-NAME</i></pre>
    <br /><br />
    Document the name of the security-realm associated with each management interface.
    <br /><br />
    2. Review the security realm
    using the command:
    <br /><br />
    For standalone systems:
    <pre>ls /core-service=management/security-realm=<i>SECURITY_REALM_NAME</i>/authentication</pre>
    <br /><br />
    For managed domains:
    <pre>ls /host=master/core-service=management/security-realm=<i>SECURITY_REALM_NAME</i>/authentication</pre>
    <br /><br />
    If the command in step 2 does
    not return a security realm that uses certificates for authentication, this is a
    finding.
