description: |-
    Launch the jboss-cli management interface substituting standalone or domain for
    <i>CONFIG</i> based upon the server installation.
    <br /><br />
    <pre>&lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/<i>CONFIG</i>/bin/jboss-cli</pre>
    <br /><br />
    connect to the server and run the following command:
    <br /><br />
    <pre>/core-service=management/access=audit/logger=audit-log:write-attribute(name=enabled,value=true)</pre>

rationale: |-
    Without logging the enforcement of access restrictions against changes to the
    application server configuration, it will be difficult to identify attempted
    attacks, and a log trail will not be available for forensic investigation for
    after-the-fact actions. Configuration changes may occur to any of the modules
    within the application server through the management interface, but logging of
    actions to the configuration of a module outside the application server is not
    logged.
    <br /><br />
    Enforcement actions are the methods or mechanisms used to prevent
    unauthorized changes to configuration settings. Enforcement action methods may
    be as simple as denying access to a file based on the application of file
    permissions (access restriction). Log items may consist of lists of actions
    blocked by access restrictions or changes identified after the fact.

    Log on to the OS of the JBoss server with OS permissions that allow access to
    JBoss.
    Using the relevant OS commands and syntax, cd to the <tt>&lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/bin/</tt>
    folder.
    Run the <pre>jboss-cli</pre> script.
    Connect to the server and authenticate.
    Run the command:
    <br /><br />
    <pre>ls /core-service=management/access=audit/logger=audit-log</pre>
    <br /><br />
    If <pre>"enabled" =.</pre>, this is a finding.
