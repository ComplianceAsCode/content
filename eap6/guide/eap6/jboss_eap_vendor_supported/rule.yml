title: 'JBoss Version Is Vendor Supported'

description: 'Obtain vendor support from Red Hat.'

rationale: |-
    The JBoss product is available as Open Source; however, the Red Hat vendor
    provides updates, patches and support for the JBoss product. It is imperative
    that patches and updates be applied to JBoss in a timely manner as many attacks
    against JBoss focus on unpatched systems. It is critical that support be
    obtained and made available.

ocil_clause: 'it is not'

ocil: |-
    Interview the system admin and have them either show documented proof of
    current support, or have them demonstrate their ability to access the Red Hat
    Enterprise Support portal.
    <br /><br />
    Verify Red Hat support includes coverage for the
    JBoss product.
    <br /><br />
    If there is no current and active support from the vendor, this
    is a finding.
