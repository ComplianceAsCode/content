title: 'Separate JBoss Management Network'

description: |-
    Refer to Section 4.9 of the JBoss EAP 6.3 Installation guide for detailed
    instructions on how to start JBoss as a service.
    <br /><br />
    Use the following command line
    parameters to assign the management interface to a specific management network.
    These command line flags must be added both when starting JBoss as a service and
    when starting from the command line.
    <br /><br />
    Substitute your actual network address for
    the 10.x.x.x addresses provided as an example below.
    <br /><br />
    For a standalone
    configuration:
    <pre>
    JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -bmanagement=10.2.2.1 -b 10.1.1.1
    JBOSS_HOME/bin/domain.sh -bmanagement=10.2.2.1 -b 10.1.1.1
    </pre>
    <br /><br />
    If a management
    network is not available, you may substitute localhost/127.0.0.1 for management
    address. This will force you to manage the JBoss server from the local host.

rationale: |-
    JBoss provides multiple interfaces for accessing the system. By default,
    these are called public and management. Allowing non-
    management traffic to access the JBoss management interface increases the
    chances of a security compromise. The JBoss server must be configured to bind
    the management interface to a network that controls access. This is usually a
    network that has been designated as a management network and has restricted
    access. Similarly, the public interface must be bound to a network that is not
    on the same segment as the management interface.

ocil: |-
    Obtain documentation and network drawings from system admin that shows the
    network interfaces on the JBoss server and the networks they are configured for.
    If a management network is not used, you may substitute localhost/127.0.0.1 for
    management address. If localhost/127.0.0.1 is used for management interface,
    this is not a finding.
    <br /><br />
    From the JBoss server open the web-based admin console
    by pointing a browser to <pre>HTTP://127.0.0.1:9990</pre>.
    Log on to the management console
    with admin credentials.
    Select <tt>RUNTIME</tt>.
    Expand <tt>STATUS</tt> by clicking on <tt>+</tt>.
    Expand <tt>PLATFORM</tt> by clicking on <tt>+</tt>.
    In the <tt>Environment</tt> tab, click the <tt>&gt;</tt>
    arrow until you see the <tt>jboss.bind.properties</tt> and the
    <pre>jboss.bind.properties.management</pre> values.
    <br /><br />
    If the
    jboss.bind.properties and the jboss.bind.properties.management do not have
    different IP network addresses assigned, this is a finding.
    <br /><br />
    Review the network
    documentation. If access to the management IP address is not restricted, this
    is a finding.
