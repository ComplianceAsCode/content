title: 'Configure JBoss Log Permissions'

description: |-
    Configure the OS file permissions on the application server to protect log
    information from unauthorized access.

rationale: |-
    If log data were to become compromised, then competent forensic analysis and
    discovery of the true source of potentially malicious system activity is
    difficult, if not impossible, to achieve.
    <br /><br />
    When not configured to use a
    centralized logging solution like a syslog server, the JBoss EAP application
    server writes log data to log files that are stored on the OS; appropriate file
    permissions must be used to restrict access.
    <br /><br />
    Log information includes all
    information (e.g., log records, log settings, transaction logs, and log reports)
    needed to successfully log information system activity. Application servers must
    protect log information from unauthorized access.

    Examine the log file locations and inspect the file permissions. Interview the
    system admin to determine log file locations. The default location for the log
    files is:
    <br /><br />
    Standalone configuration:
    <pre>
    &lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/standalone/log/
    </pre>
    <br /><br />
    Managed
    Domain configuration:
    <pre>
    &lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/domain/servers/<i>servername</i>/log/
    &lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/domain/log/
    </pre>
    <br /><br />
    Review the file permissions for the log file
    directories. The method used for identifying file permissions will be based
    upon the OS the EAP server is installed on.
    <br /><br />
    Identify all users with file
    permissions that allow them to read, modify, or delete log files.
    <br /><br />
    Request documentation from
    system admin that identifies the users who are authorized to read, modify, or delete log files.
    <br /><br />
    If
    unauthorized users are allowed to read, modify, or delete log files, or if documentation that
    identifies the users who are authorized to read, modify, or delete log files is missing, this is a
    finding.
