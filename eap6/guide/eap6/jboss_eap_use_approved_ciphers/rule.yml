title: 'Use Approved Ciphers'

description: |-
    Reference section 4.6 of the JBoss EAP 6.3 Security Guide located on the Red
    Hat vendor's website for step-by-step instructions on establishing SSL
    encryption on JBoss.
    <br /><br />
    The overall steps include:
    <br /><br />
    1. Add an HTTPS connector.
    2. Configure the SSL encryption certificate and keys.
    3. Set the Cipher to an approved algorithm.

rationale: |-
    Preventing the disclosure or modification of transmitted information requires
    that application servers take measures to employ approved cryptography in order
    to protect the information during transmission over the network. This is usually
    achieved through the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS), SSL VPN, or IPSec
    tunnel.
    <br /><br />
    If data in transit is unencrypted, it is vulnerable to disclosure and
    modification. If approved cryptographic algorithms are not used, encryption
    strength cannot be assured.
    <br /><br />
    FIPS 140-2 approved TLS versions include TLS V1.0
    or greater.
    <br /><br />
    TLS must be enabled, and non-FIPS-approved SSL versions must be
    disabled. NIST SP 800-52 specifies the preferred configurations for government
    systems.

    Log on to the OS of the JBoss server with OS permissions that allow access to
    JBoss.
    Using the relevant OS commands and syntax, cd to the <tt>&lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/bin/</tt>
    folder.
    Run the <pre>jboss-cli</pre> script.
    Connect to the server and authenticate.
    Validate that the TLS protocol is used for HTTPS connections.
    Run the command:
    <pre>ls /subsystem=web/connector=https/ssl=configuration</pre>
    <br /><br />
    Review the
    cipher suites. The following suites are acceptable as per NIST 800-52r1 section
    3.3.1 - Cipher Suites. Refer to the NIST document for a complete list of
    acceptable cipher suites. The source NIST document and approved encryption
    algorithms/cipher suites are subject to change and should be referenced.
    <pre>
    AES_128_CBC
    AES_256_CBC
    AES_128_GCM
    AES_128_CCM
    AES_256_CCM
    </pre>
    <br /><br />
    If the cipher
    suites utilized by the TLS server are not approved by NIST as per 800-52r1, this
    is a finding.
