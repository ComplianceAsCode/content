title: 'Enable HTTPS for Management Sessions'

description: |-
    Follow the specific instructions in the Red Hat Security Guide for EAP version
    6.3 to configure the management console for HTTPS.
    <br /><br />
    This involves the following steps.
    1. Create a keystore in JKS format.
    2. Ensure the management console binds to HTTPS.
    3. Create a new Security Realm.
    4. Configure Management Interface to use new security realm.
    5. Configure the management console to use the keystore.
    6. Restart the EAP server.

rationale: |-
    Types of management interfaces utilized by the JBoss EAP application server
    include web-based HTTP interfaces as well as command line-based management
    interfaces. In the event remote HTTP management is required, the access must be
    via HTTPS.
    <br /><br />
    This requirement is in conjunction with the requirement to isolate
    all management access to a restricted network.

    Log on to the OS of the JBoss server with OS permissions that allow access to
    JBoss. Using the relevant OS commands and syntax, cd to the
    <tt>&lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/bin/</tt>
    folder. Run the <pre>jboss-cli</pre> script. Connect to the server and authenticate.
    <br /><br />
    For a standalone configuration run the following command:
    <pre>ls /core-service=management/management-interface=http-interface</pre>
    <br /><br />
    If <pre>"secure-socket-binding"=undefined</pre>, this is a finding.
    <br /><br />
    For a domain configuration run
    the following command:
    <pre>ls /host=master/core-service=management/management-interface=http-interface</pre>
    <br /><br />
    If <tt>secure-port</tt> is undefined, this is a finding.
