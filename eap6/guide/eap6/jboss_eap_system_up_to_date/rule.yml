title: 'JBoss System Is Patched'

description: |-
    Configure the operating system and the application server to use a patch
    management system or process that ensures security-relevant updates are
    installed within the time period directed by the ISSM.

rationale: |-
    The JBoss product is available as Open Source; however, the Red Hat vendor
    provides updates, patches and support for the JBoss product. It is imperative
    that patches and updates be applied to JBoss in a timely manner as many attacks
    against JBoss focus on unpatched systems. It is critical that support be
    obtained and made available.
