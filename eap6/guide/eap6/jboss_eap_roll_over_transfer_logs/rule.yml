title: 'Roll Over and Transfer JBoss Logs'

description: |-
    Open the web-based management interface by opening a browser and pointing it to
    <tt>HTTPS://<i>EAP_SERVER</i>:9990/</tt>
    <br /><br />
    Authenticate as a user with Admin rights.
    Navigate
    to the <tt>Configuration</tt> tab.
    Expand <tt>+</tt> Subsystems.
    Expand <tt>+</tt> Core.
    Select
    <tt>Logging</tt>.
    Select the <tt>Handler</tt> tab.
    Select <tt>Periodic</tt>.
    <br /><br />
    If a
    periodic file handler does not exist, reference JBoss admin guide for
    instructions on how to create a file handler that will rotate logs on a daily
    basis.
    Create scripts that package and off-load log data at least weekly.

rationale: |-
    Information stored in one location is vulnerable to accidental or incidental
    deletion or alteration. Protecting log data is important during a forensic
    investigation to ensure investigators can track and understand what may have
    occurred. Off-loading should be set up as a scheduled task but can be
    configured to be run manually, if other processes during the off-loading are
    manual.
    <br /><br />
    Off-loading is a common process in information systems with limited log
    storage capacity.

    If the JBoss server is configured to use a Syslog Handler, this is not a
    finding.
    <br /><br />
    Log on to the OS of the JBoss server with OS permissions that allow
    access to JBoss.
    Using the relevant OS commands and syntax, cd to the
    <tt>&lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/bin/</tt> folder.
    Run the <pre>jboss-cli</pre> script.
    Connect to the server and authenticate.
    <br /><br />
    Determine if there is a periodic rotating file handler.
    <br /><br />
    For a
    domain configuration run the following command; where <i>SERVERNAME</i> is a variable
    for all of the servers in the domain. Usually <tt>server-one</tt>, <tt>server-two</tt>, etc.:
    <br /><br />
    <pre>ls /host=master/server=<i>SERVERNAME</i>/subsystem=logging/periodic-rotating-file-handler=</pre>
    <br /><br />
    For a standalone configuration run the command:
    <pre>ls /subsystem=logging/periodic-rotating-file-handler=</pre>
    <br /><br />
    If the command does not return <tt>FILE</tt>, this is a finding.
    <br /><br />
    Review the
    <tt>&lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/standalone/log</tt> folder for the existence of rotated logs, and ask
    the admin to demonstrate how rotated logs are packaged and transferred to
    another system on at least a weekly basis.
