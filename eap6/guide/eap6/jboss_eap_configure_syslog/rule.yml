title: 'Enable Logging to syslog'

description: |-
    Log on to the OS of the JBoss server with OS permissions that allow access to
    JBoss.
    Using the relevant OS commands and syntax, cd to the <tt>&lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/bin/</tt>
    folder.
    Run the <pre>jboss-cli</pre> script.
    Connect to the server and authenticate.
    Run
    the command:
    <br /><br />
    Standalone configuration:
    <pre>ls /subsystem=logging/syslog-handler=</pre>
    <br /><br />
    Domain configuration:
    <pre>ls /profile=default/subsystem=logging/syslog-handler=</pre>
    <br /><br />
    If no values are returned, this is a finding.

rationale: |-
    Information system logging capability is critical for accurate forensic
    analysis. Log record content that may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of
    this control includes, but is not limited to, time stamps, source and
    destination IP addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions,
    application-specific events, success/fail indications, filenames involved,
    access control or flow control rules invoked.
    <br /><br />
    Off-loading is a common process
    in information systems with limited log storage capacity.
    <br /><br />
    Centralized
    management of log records provides for efficiency in maintenance and management
    of records, as well as the backup and archiving of those records. Application
    servers and their related components are required to off-load log records onto a
    different system or media than the system being logged.
