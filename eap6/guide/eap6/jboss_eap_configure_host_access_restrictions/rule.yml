title: 'Configure Host Access Restrictions for Applications'

description: |-
    Configure the Java security manager to enforce access restrictions to the host
    system resources in accordance with application design and resource
    requirements.

rationale: |-
    The Java Security Manager is a java class that manages the external boundary of
    the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) sandbox, controlling how code executing within
    the JVM can interact with resources outside the JVM.
    <br /><br />
    The JVM requires a
    security policy in order to restrict application access. A properly configured
    security policy will define what rights the application has to the underlying
    system. For example, rights to make changes to files on the host system or to
    initiate network sockets in order to connect to another system.

ocil: |-
    Obtain documentation from the admin that identifies the applications hosted on
    the JBoss server as well as the corresponding rights the application requires.
    For example, if the application requires network socket permissions and file
    write permissions, those requirements should be documented.
    <br /><br />
    1. Identify the
    JBoss installation as either domain or standalone and review the relevant
    configuration file.
    For domain installs: <tt>JBOSS_HOME/bin/domain.conf</tt>
    For
    standalone installs: <tt>JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.conf</tt>
    <br /><br />
    2. Identify the location
    and name of the security policy by reading the JAVA_OPTS flag
    <pre>-Djava.security.policy=<i>file name</i></pre>
    where <i>file name</i> will indicate name and
    location of security policy. If the application uses a policy URL, obtain URL
    and policy file from system admin.
    <br /><br />
    3. Review security policy and ensure hosted
    applications have the appropriate restrictions placed on them as per documented
    application functionality requirements.
    <br /><br />
    If the security policy does not
    restrict application access to host resources as per documented requirements,
    this is a finding.
