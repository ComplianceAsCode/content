title: 'Remove Unnecessary Applications'

description: |-
    Identify, authorize, and document all applications that are deployed to the
    application server. Remove unauthorized applications.

rationale: |-
    Extraneous services and applications running on an application server expands
    the attack surface and increases risk to the application server. Securing any
    server involves identifying and removing any unnecessary services and, in the
    case of an application server, unnecessary and/or unapproved applications.

    Log on to the OS of the JBoss server with OS permissions that allow access to
    JBoss.
    Using the relevant OS commands and syntax, cd to the <tt>&lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/bin/</tt>
    folder.
    Run the <pre>jboss-cli</pre> script.
    Connect to the server and authenticate.
    Run the command:
    <br /><br />
    <pre>ls /deployment</pre>
    <br /><br />
    The list of deployed applications is displayed.
    Have the system admin identify the applications listed and confirm they are
    approved applications.
    <br /><br />
    If the system admin cannot provide documentation proving
    their authorization for deployed applications, this is a finding.
