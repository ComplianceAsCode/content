title: 'Configure LDAP'

description: |-
    Follow steps in section 11.8 - Management Interface Security in the
    JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform-6.3
    -Administration_and_Configuration_Guide-en-US document.
    <br /><br />
    1. Create an outbound connection to the LDAP server.
    2. Create an LDAP-enabled security realm.
    3. Reference the new security domain in the Management Interface.

rationale: |-
    To assure accountability and prevent unauthorized access, application server
    users must be uniquely identified and authenticated. This is typically
    accomplished via the use of a user store that is either local (OS-based) or
    centralized (Active Directory/LDAP) in nature. It should be noted that JBoss
    does not specifically mention Active Directory since AD is LDAP aware.
    <br /><br />
    To
    ensure accountability and prevent unauthorized access, the JBoss Server must be
    configured to utilize a centralized authentication mechanism.

    Log on to the OS of the JBoss server with OS permissions that allow access to
    JBoss.
    Using the relevant OS commands and syntax, cd to the <tt>&lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/bin/</tt>
    folder.
    Run the <pre>jboss-cli</pre> script.
    Connect to the server and authenticate.
    <br /><br />
    To obtain the list of security realms run the command:
    <pre>ls /core-service=management/security-realm=</pre>
    <br /><br />
    Review each security realm using the
    command:
    <pre>ls /core-service=management/security-realm=<i>SECURITY_REALM_NAME</i>/authentication</pre>
    <br /><br />
    If this command does not
    return a security realm that uses LDAP for authentication, this is a finding.
