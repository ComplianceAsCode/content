title: 'Configure mgmt-users.properties File Permissions'

description: "Configure the file permissions to allow access to authorized users only.\nOwner can be full access. Group can be full access. \nAll others must have execute\npermissions only."

rationale: |-
    The mgmt-users.properties file contains the password hashes of all users who
    are in a management role and must be protected. Application servers have the
    ability to specify that the hosted applications utilize shared libraries. The
    application server must have a capability to divide roles based upon duties
    wherein one project user (such as a developer) cannot modify the shared library
    code of another project user. The application server must also be able to
    specify that non-privileged users cannot modify any shared library code at
    all.

    The mgmt-users.properties files are located in the standalone or domain
    configuration folder.

    <br /><br />
    Identify users who
    have access to the files using relevant OS commands.
    <br /><br />
    Obtain documentation from
    system admin identifying authorized users.
    <br /><br />
    Owner can be full access. Group can be full access.
    All others must have execute permissions only.
    <br /><br />
    If the file
    permissions are not configured so as to restrict access to only authorized
    users, or if documentation that identifies authorized users is missing, this is
    a finding.
