title: 'Remove Silent Authentication - Application Security Realm'

description: |-
    Log on to the OS of the JBoss server with OS permissions that allow access to
    JBoss.
    Using the relevant OS commands and syntax, cd to the <tt>&lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/bin/</tt>
    folder.
    Run the <pre>jboss-cli</pre> script.
    Connect to the server and authenticate.
    Remove the local element from the Application Realm.
    For standalone servers, run
    the following command:
    <pre>/core-service=management/securityrealm=ApplicationRealm/authentication=local:remove</pre>
    <br /><br />
    For managed domain installations,
    run the following command:
    <pre>/host=HOST_NAME/core-service=management/securityrealm=ApplicationRealm/authentication=local:remove</pre>

rationale: |-
    Silent Authentication is a configuration setting that allows local OS users
    access to the JBoss server and a wide range of operations without specifically
    authenticating on an individual user basis. By default $localuser is a
    Superuser. This introduces an integrity and availability vulnerability and
    violates best practice requirements regarding accountability.
