title: 'Use Approves TLS version'

description: |-
    Reference section 4.6 of the JBoss EAP 6.3 Security Guide located on the Red
    Hat vendor's web site for step-by-step instructions on establishing SSL
    encryption on JBoss.
    <br /><br />
    The overall steps include:
    <br /><br />
    1. Add an HTTPS connector.
    2. Configure the SSL encryption certificate and keys.
    3. Set the protocol to TLS V1.1 or V1.2.

rationale: |-
    Preventing the disclosure of transmitted information requires that the
    application server take measures to employ some form of cryptographic mechanism
    in order to protect the information during transmission. This is usually
    achieved through the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS).
    <br /><br />
    JBoss relies on
    the underlying SSL implementation running on the OS. This can be either Java
    based or OpenSSL. The SSL protocol setting determines which SSL protocol is
    used. SSL has known security vulnerabilities, so TLS should be used instead.
    If data is transmitted unencrypted, the data then becomes vulnerable to
    disclosure. The disclosure may reveal user identifier/password combinations,
    website code revealing business logic, or other user personal information.
    <br /><br />
    FIPS 140-2 approved TLS versions include TLS V1.0 or greater.
    <br /><br />
    TLS must be enabled,
    and non-FIPS-approved SSL versions must be disabled. NIST SP 800-52 specifies
    the preferred configurations for government systems.

    Log on to the OS of the JBoss server with OS permissions that allow access to
    JBoss.
    Using the relevant OS commands and syntax, cd to the <tt>&lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/bin/</tt>
    folder.
    Run the <pre>jboss-cli</pre> script.
    Connect to the server and authenticate.
    Validate that the TLS protocol is used for HTTPS connections.
    Run the command:
    <pre>ls /subsystem=web/connector=https/ssl=configuration</pre>
    <br /><br />
    If a TLS V1.1 or V1.2 protocol is not returned, this is a finding.
