title: 'Configure JBoss Log Off-Loading Frequency'

description: |-
    Configure the application server to off-load log records every seven days onto
    a different system or media from the system being logged.

rationale: |-
    JBoss logs by default are written to the local file system. A centralized
    logging solution like syslog should be used whenever possible; however, any log
    data stored to the file system needs to be off-loaded. JBoss EAP does not
    provide an automated backup capability. Instead, reliance is placed on OS or
    third-party tools to back up or off-load the log files.
    <br /><br />
    Protection of log data
    includes assuring log data is not accidentally lost or deleted. Off-loading log
    records to a different system or onto separate media from the system the
    application server is actually running on helps to assure that, in the event of
    a catastrophic system failure, the log records will be retained.

ocil: |-
    Interview the system admin and obtain details on how the log files are being
    off-loaded to a different system or media.
    <br /><br />
    If the log files are not off-loaded
    a minimum of every 7 days, this is a finding.
