title: 'Use DoD Approved Certificates'

description: |-
    Configure the application server to use DoD- or CNSS-approved Class 3 or Class
    4 PKI certificates.

rationale: |-
    Class 3 PKI certificates are used for servers and software signing rather than
    for identifying individuals. Class 4 certificates are used for business-to-
    business transactions. Utilizing unapproved certificates not issued or approved
    by DoD or CNS creates an integrity risk. The application server must utilize
    approved DoD or CNS Class 3 or Class 4 certificates for software signing and
    business-to-business transactions.

ocil_clause: 'it is not'

ocil: |-
    Interview the administrator to determine if JBoss is using certificates for
    PKI. If JBoss is not performing any PKI functions, this finding is NA.
    <br /><br />
    The CA
    certs are usually stored in a file called cacerts located in the directory
    <tt>$JAVA_HOME/lib/security</tt>. If the file is not in this location, use a search
    command to locate the file, or ask the administrator where the certificate store
    is located.
    <br /><br />
    Open a dos shell or terminal window and change to the location of
    the certificate store. To view the certificates within the certificate store,
    run the command (in this example, the keystore file is cacerts.):
    <pre>keytool -list -v -keystore ./cacerts</pre>
    <br /><br />
    Locate the <pre>OU</pre> field for each certificate
    within the keystore. The field should contain either <pre>DoD</pre> or
    <pre>CNSS</pre> as the Organizational Unit (OU).
    <br /><br />
    If the OU does not show that
    the certificates are DoD or CNSS supplied, this is a finding.
