title: 'Restrict the JBoss Account'

description: |-
    Use the relevant OS commands to restrict JBoss user account from interactively
    logging on to the console of the JBoss system.
    <br /><br />
    For Windows systems, use GPO.
    For UNIX like systems using ssh DenyUsers <i>account id</i> or follow established
    procedure for restricting access.

rationale: |-
    JBoss does not require admin rights to operate and should be run as a regular
    user. In addition, if the user account was to be compromised and the account
    was allowed interactive logon rights, this would increase the risk and attack
    surface against the JBoss system. The right to interactively log on to the
    system using the JBoss account should be limited according to the OS
    capabilities.

ocil_clause: 'it is not'

ocil: |-
    Identify the user account used to run the JBoss server. Use relevant OS
    commands to determine logon rights to the system. This account should not have
    full shell/interactive access to the system.
    <br /><br />
    If the user account used to
    operate JBoss can log on interactively, this is a finding.
