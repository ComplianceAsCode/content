title: 'Enable Role Based Access Control (RBAC)'

description: |-
    Run the following command.
    <pre>&lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/bin/jboss-cli.sh -c -&gt; connect -&gt; cd
    /core-service=management/access-authorization :write-attribute(name=provider,
    value=rbac)</pre>
    <br /><br />
    Restart JBoss.
    <br /><br />
    Map users to roles by running the following
    command. Upper-case words are variables.
    <br /><br />
    <pre>role-mapping=ROLENAME/include=ALIAS:add(name-USERNAME, type=USER ROLE)</pre>

rationale: |-
    By default, the JBoss server is not configured to utilize role based access
    controls (RBAC). RBAC provides the capability to restrict user access to their
    designated management role, thereby limiting access to only the JBoss
    functionality that they are supposed to have. Without RBAC, the JBoss server is
    not able to enforce authorized access according to role.

    Log on to the OS of the JBoss server with OS permissions that allow access to
    JBoss.
    Using the relevant OS commands and syntax, cd to the
    <pre>&lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/bin/</pre>
    folder. Run the jboss-cli script.
    Connect to the server and authenticate.
    <br /><br />
    Run the following command:
    <br /><br />
    For standalone servers:
    <pre>ls /core-service=management/access=authorization/</pre>
    <br /><br />
    For managed domain
    installations:
    <pre>ls /host=master/core-service=management/access=authorization/</pre>
    <br /><br />
    If the <tt>provider</tt>
    attribute is not set to <tt>rbac</tt>, this is a finding.
