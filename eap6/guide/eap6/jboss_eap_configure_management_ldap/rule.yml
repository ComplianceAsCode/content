title: 'Configure LDAP for Management Interfaces'

description: |-
    Follow steps in section 11.8 - Management Interface Security in the
    JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform-6.3
    -Administration_and_Configuration_Guide-en-US document.
    <br /><br />
    1. Create an outbound connection to the LDAP server.
    2. Create an LDAP-enabled security realm.
    3. Reference the new security domain in the Management Interface.

rationale: |-
    JBoss EAP provides a security realm called ManagementRealm. By default, this
    realm uses the mgmt-users.properties file for authentication. Using file-based
    authentication does not allow the JBoss server to be in compliance with a wide
    range of user management requirements such as automatic disabling of inactive
    accounts as per DoD policy. To address this issue, the management interfaces
    used to manage the JBoss server must be associated with a security realm that
    provides centralized authentication management. Examples are AD or LDAP.
    Management of user identifiers is not applicable to shared information system
    accounts (e.g., guest and anonymous accounts). It is commonly the case that a
    user account is the name of an information system account associated with an
    individual.

    Log on to the OS of the JBoss server with OS permissions that allow access to
    JBoss.
    Using the relevant OS commands and syntax, cd to the <tt>&lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/bin/</tt>
    folder.
    Run the <pre>jboss-cli</pre> script.
    Connect to the server and authenticate.
    Obtain the list of management interfaces by running the command:
    <pre>ls /core-service=management/management-interface</pre>
    <br /><br />
    Identify the security realm used
    by each management interface configuration by running the command:
    <pre>ls /core-service=management/management-interface=<i>MANAGEMENT-INTERFACE-NAME</i></pre>
    Determine if the security realm assigned to the management interface uses LDAP
    for authentication by running the command:
    <pre>ls /core-service=management/security-realm=<i>SECURITY_REALM_NAME</i>/authentication</pre>
    <br /><br />
    If the security
    realm assigned to the management interface does not utilize LDAP for
    authentication, this is a finding.
