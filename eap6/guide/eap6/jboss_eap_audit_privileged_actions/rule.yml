title: 'Audit JBoss Privileged Actions'

description: |-
    Launch the jboss-cli management interface substituting standalone or domain for
    <i>CONFIG</i> based upon the server installation.
    <br /><br />
    <pre>&lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/<i>CONFIG/</i>/bin/jboss-cli</pre>
    <br /><br />
    connect to the server and run the following command:
    <br /><br />
    <pre>/core-service=management/access=audit/logger=audit-log:write-attribute(name=enabled,value=true)</pre>

rationale: |-
    In order to be able to provide a forensic history of activity, the application
    server must ensure users who are granted a privileged role or those who utilize
    a separate distinct account when accessing privileged functions or data have
    their actions logged.
    <br /><br />
    If privileged activity is not logged, no forensic logs
    can be used to establish accountability for privileged actions that occur on the
    system.
