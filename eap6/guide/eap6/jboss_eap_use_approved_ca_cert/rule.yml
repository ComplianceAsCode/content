title: 'Use Approved DoD Certificate Authorities'

description: |-
    Locate the cacerts file for the JVM. This can be done using the appropriate
    find command for the OS and change to the directory where the cacerts file is
    located.
    <br /><br />
    Remove the certificates that have a CA that is non-DoD approved, and
    import DoD CA-approved certificates.

rationale: |-
    Untrusted Certificate Authorities (CA) can issue certificates, but they may be
    issued by organizations or individuals that seek to compromise DoD systems or by
    organizations with insufficient security controls. If the CA used for verifying
    the certificate is not a DoD-approved CA, trust of this CA has not been
    established.
    <br /><br />
    The DoD will only accept PKI certificates obtained from a DoD-
    approved internal or external certificate authority. Reliance on CAs for the
    establishment of secure sessions includes, for example, the use of SSL/TLS
    certificates. The application server must only allow the use of DoD PKI-
    established certificate authorities for verification.

    Locate the cacerts file for the JVM. This can be done using the appropriate
    find command for the OS and change to the directory where the cacerts file is
    located.
    <br /><br />
    To view the certificates stored within this file, execute the java
    command <pre>keytool -list -v -keystore ./cacerts</pre>.
    Verify that the Certificate
    Authority (CA) for each certificate is DoD-approved.
    <br /><br />
    If any certificates have a
    CA that are not DoD-approved, this is a finding.
