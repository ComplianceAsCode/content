title: 'Disable or Replace the JBoss Welcome Page'

description: |-
    Use the Management CLI script <pre>$JBOSS_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh</pre> to run the following
    command. You may need to change the profile to modify a different managed domain
    profile, or remove the <pre>/profile=default</pre> portion of the command for a
    standalone server.
    <br /><br />
    <pre>/profile=default/subsystem=web/virtual-server=default-host:writeattribute(name=enable-welcome-root,value.)</pre>
    <br /><br />
    To configure
    your web application to use the root context (/) as its URL address, modify the
    applications jboss-web.xml, which is located in the applications <tt>META-INF/</tt> or
    <tt>WEB-INF/</tt> directory. Replace its <tt>&lt;context-root&gt;</tt> directive with one that looks
    like the following:
    <br /><br />
    <pre>
    <jboss-web>
        <context-root>/</context-root>
    </jboss-web>
    </pre>

rationale: |-
    The Welcome to JBoss web page provides a redirect to the JBoss admin console,
    which, by default, runs on TCP 9990 as well as redirects to the Online User
    Guide and Online User Groups hosted at locations on the Internet. The welcome
    page is unnecessary and should be disabled or replaced with a valid web
    page.

ocil: |-
    Use a web browser and browse to <pre>HTTP://JBOSS SERVER IP ADDRESS:8080</pre>
    <br /><br />
    If the
    JBoss Welcome page is displayed, this is a finding.
