title: 'Configure JBoss Auditor Role'

description: |-
    Obtain documented approvals from ISSM, and assign the appropriate personnel
    into the <pre>Auditor</pre> role.

rationale: |-
    The JBoss server must be configured to select which personnel are assigned the
    role of selecting which loggable events are to be logged.
    In JBoss, the role
    designated for selecting auditable events is the <tt>Auditor</tt> role.
    The
    personnel or roles that can select loggable events are only the ISSM (or
    individuals or roles appointed by the ISSM).

ocil: |-
    Log on to the OS of the JBoss server with OS permissions that allow access to
    JBoss.
    Using the relevant OS commands and syntax, cd to the <tt>&lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/bin/</tt>
    folder.
    Run the <pre>jboss-cli</pre> script to start the Command Line Interface (CLI).
    Connect to the server and authenticate.
    Run the command:
    <br /><br />
    For a Managed Domain
    configuration:
    <pre>ls host=master/server/<i>SERVERNAME</i>/core-service=management/access=authorization/role-mapping=Auditor/include=</pre>
    <br /><br />
    For a Standalone configuration:
    <pre>ls /core-service=management/access=authorization/role-mapping=Auditor/include=</pre>
    <br /><br />
    If
    the list of users in the Auditors group is not approved by the ISSM, this is a
    finding.
