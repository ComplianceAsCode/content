title: 'Configure JBoss Log Directory Permissions'

description: |-
    Configure file permissions on the JBoss log folder to protect from unauthorized
    access.

rationale: |-
    If the application provides too much information in error logs and
    administrative messages to the screen, this could lead to compromise. The
    structure and content of error messages need to be carefully considered by the
    organization and development team. The extent to which the information system is
    able to identify and handle error conditions is guided by organizational policy
    and operational requirements.
    <br /><br />
    Application servers must protect the error
    messages that are created by the application server. All application server
    users' accounts are used for the management of the server and the applications
    residing on the application server. All accounts are assigned to a certain role
    with corresponding access rights. The application server must restrict access to
    error messages so only authorized users may view them. Error messages are
    usually written to logs contained on the file system. The application server
    will usually create new log files as needed and must take steps to ensure that
    the proper file permissions are utilized when the log files are created.

    If the JBoss log folder is installed in the default location and
    AS-000133-JBOSS-00079 is not a finding, the log folders are protected and this
    requirement is not a finding.
    <br /><br />
    By default, JBoss installs its log files into a
    sub-folder of the <pre>jboss-eap-6.3</pre> home folder.
    Using a UNIX like OS
    example, the default location for log files is:
    <br /><br />
    <pre>
    JBOSS_HOME/standalone/log
    JBOSS_HOME/domain/log
    </pre>
    <br /><br />
    For a standalone configuration:
    <tt>JBOSS_HOME/standalone/log/server.log</tt> Contains all server log messages,
    including server startup messages.
    <br /><br />
    For a domain configuration:
    <tt>JBOSS_HOME/domain/log/hostcontroller.log</tt>
    Host Controller boot log. Contains log
    messages related to the startup of the host controller.
    <tt>JBOSS_HOME/domain/log/processcontroller.log</tt>
    Process controller boot log.
    Contains log messages related to the startup of the process controller.
    <tt>JBOSS_HOME/domain/servers/SERVERNAME/log/server.log</tt>
    The server log for the named
    server. Contains all log messages for that server, including server startup
    messages.
    <br /><br />
    Log on with an OS user account with JBoss access and permissions.
    Navigate to the <tt>Jboss-eap-6.3</tt> folder using the relevant OS commands
    for either a UNIX like OS or a Windows OS.
    <br /><br />
    Examine the permissions of the JBoss logs folders.
    <br /><br />
    Owner can be full access. Group can be full access.
    All others must be restricted.
    <br /><br />
    If the JBoss log folder is world readable or world
    writeable, this is a finding.
