title: 'Secure the JBoss Management Interfaces'

description: |-
    Identify the security realm used for management of the system. By default,
    this is called <tt>Management Realm</tt>.
    <br /><br />
    If a management security realm is not
    already available, reference the Jboss EAP 6.3 system administration guide for
    instructions on how to create a security realm for management purposes. Create
    the management realm, and assign authentication and authorization access
    restrictions to the management realm.
    <br /><br />
    Assign the management interfaces to the management realm.

rationale: |-
    JBoss utilizes the concept of security realms to secure the management
    interfaces used for JBoss server administration. If the security realm
    attribute is omitted or removed from the management interface definition, access
    to that interface is no longer secure. The JBoss management interfaces must be
    secured.

    Log on to the OS of the JBoss server with OS permissions that allow access to
    JBoss.
    Using the relevant OS commands and syntax, cd to the <pre>&lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/bin/</pre>
    folder.
    Run the <pre>jboss-cli</pre> script.
    Connect to the server and authenticate.
    Identify the management interfaces. To identity the management interfaces, run
    the following command:
    <br /><br />
    For standalone servers:
    <pre>ls /core-service=management/management-interface=</pre>
    <br /><br />
    For managed domain installations:
    <pre>ls /host=HOST_NAME/core-service=management/management-interface=</pre>
    <br /><br />
    By default,
    JBoss provides two management interfaces; they are named <tt>NATIVE-INTERFACE</tt>
    and <tt>HTTP-INTERFACE</tt>. The system may or may not have both
    interfaces enabled. For each management interface listed as a result of the
    previous command, append the name of the management interface to the end of the
    following command.
    <br /><br />
    For a standalone system:
    <br /><br />
    <pre>ls /core-service=management/management-interface=&lt;MANAGEMENT INTERFACE NAME&gt;</pre>
    <br /><br />
    For a managed domain:
    <pre>ls /host=HOST_NAME/core-service=management/management-interface=&lt;MANAGEMENT INTERFACE NAME&gt;</pre>
    <br /><br />
    If the <pre>security-realm=</pre> attribute is not
    associated with a management realm, this is a finding.
