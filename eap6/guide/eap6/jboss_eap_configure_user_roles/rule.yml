title: 'Configure JBoss User Roles'

description: |-
    Document approved management users and their roles. Configure the application
    server to use RBAC and ensure users are placed into the appropriate roles.

rationale: |-
    Security realms are a series of mappings between users and passwords and users
    and roles. There are 2 JBoss security realms provided by default; they are
    <tt>management realm</tt> and <tt>application realm</tt>.
    <br /><br />
    Management realm
    stores authentication information for the management API, which provides
    functionality for the web-based management console and the management command
    line interface (CLI).
    <br /><br />
    mgmt-groups.properties stores user to group mapping for
    the ManagementRealm but only when role-based access controls (RBAC) is enabled.
    If management users are not in the appropriate role, unauthorized access to
    JBoss resources can occur.

    Review the <tt>mgmt-users.properties</tt> file.  Also review the <tt>&lt;management /&gt;</tt> section
    in the standalone.xml or domain.xml configuration files. The relevant xml file
    will depend on if the JBoss server is configured in standalone or domain mode.
    Ensure all users listed in these files are approved for management access to the
    JBoss server and are in the appropriate role.
    <br /><br />
    For domain configurations:
    <pre>
    &lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/domain/configuration/mgmt-users.properties.
    &lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/domain/configuration/domain.xml
    </pre>
    <br /><br />
    For standalone configurations:
    <pre>
    &lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/standalone/configuration/mgmt-users.properties.
    &lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml
    </pre>
    <br /><br />
    If the users listed are
    not in the appropriate role, this is a finding.
