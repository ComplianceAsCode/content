title: 'Disable Automatic Deployment'

description: |-
    Determine the JBoss server configuration as being either standalone or domain.
    Launch the relevant jboss-cli management interface substituting standalone or
    domain for <i>CONFIG</i>
    <br /><br />
    <pre>&lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/<i>CONFIG</i>/bin/jboss-cli</pre>
    <br /><br />
    connect to the server and run the command:
    <pre>/subsystem=deployment-scanner/scanner=default:write-attribute(name=scan-enabled,value.)</pre>

rationale: |-
    When dealing with access restrictions pertaining to change control, it should
    be noted that any changes to the software and/or application server
    configuration can potentially have significant effects on the overall security
    of the system.
    <br /><br />
    Access restrictions for changes also include application
    software libraries.
    <br /><br />
    If the application server provides automatic code
    deployment capability, (where updates to applications hosted on the application
    server are automatically performed, usually by the developers' IDE tool), it
    must also provide a capability to restrict the use of automatic application
    deployment. Automatic code deployments are allowable in a development
    environment, but not in production.

    Log on to the OS of the JBoss server with OS permissions that allow access to
    JBoss.
    Using the relevant OS commands and syntax, cd to the <tt>&lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/bin/</tt>
    folder.
    Run the <pre>jboss-cli</pre> script.
    Connect to the server and authenticate.
    Run
    the command:
    <br /><br />
    <pre>ls /subsystem=deployment-scanner/scanner=default</pre>
    <br /><br />
    If <pre>"scan-enabled"=true</pre>, this is a finding.
