title: 'Remove JBoss Group Acount Access'

description: |-
    Configure the application server so required users are individually
    authenticated by creating individual user accounts. Utilize an LDAP server that
    is configured according to DOD policy.

rationale: |-
    To assure individual accountability and prevent unauthorized access,
    application server users (and any processes acting on behalf of application
    server users) must be individually identified and authenticated.
    <br /><br />
    A group
    authenticator is a generic account used by multiple individuals. Use of a group
    authenticator alone does not uniquely identify individual users.
    <br /><br />
    Application
    servers must ensure that individual users are authenticated prior to
    authenticating via role or group authentication. This is to ensure that there is
    non-repudiation for actions taken.

    If the application server management interface is configured to use LDAP
    authentication this requirement is NA.
    <br /><br />
    Determine the mode in which the JBoss
    server is operating by authenticating to the OS, changing to the
    <tt>&lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/bin/</tt> folder and executing the <pre>jboss-cli</pre> script.
    Connect to the
    server and authenticate.
    Run the command: <pre>ls</pre> and examine the <tt>launch-type</tt> setting.
    <br /><br />
    User account information is stored in the following
    files for a JBoss server configured in standalone mode. The command line flags
    passed to the <tt>standalone</tt> startup script determine the standalone
    operating mode:
    <pre>
    &lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml
    &lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/standalone/configuration/standalone-full.xml
    &lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/standalone/configuration/standalone.-full-ha.xml
    &lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/standalone/configuration/standalone.ha.xml
    </pre>
    <br /><br />
    For a Managed Domain:
    <pre>
    &lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/domain/configuration/domain.xml
    </pre>
    <br /><br />
    Review both files for generic or
    shared user accounts.
    <br /><br />
    Open each xml file with a text editor and locate the
    &lt;management-interfaces&gt; section.
    Review the <pre>&lt;user name = "xxxxx"&gt;</pre> sub-
    section where <pre>xxxxx</pre> will be a user name.
    <br /><br />
    Have the system
    administrator identify the user of each user account.
    <br /><br />
    If user accounts are not
    assigned to individual users, this is a finding.
