title: 'Use Separate Management and Application Networks'

description: |-
    Start the application server with a <tt>-bmanagement</tt> and a <tt>-b</tt> flag so that admin
    management functionality and hosted applications are separated.
    <br /><br />
    Refer to
    section 4.9 in the JBoss EAP 6.3 Installation Guide for specific instructions on
    how to start the JBoss server as a service.

rationale: |-
    The application server consists of the management interface and hosted
    applications. By separating the management interface from hosted applications,
    the user must authenticate as a privileged user to the management interface
    before being presented with management functionality. This prevents non-
    privileged users from having visibility to functions not available to the user.
    By limiting visibility, a compromised non-privileged account does not offer
    information to the attacker or functionality and information needed to further
    the attack on the application server.
    <br /><br />
    JBoss is designed to operate with
    separate application and management interfaces.
    The JBoss server is started via
    a script. To start the JBoss server in domain mode, the admin will execute the
    /bin/domain.sh or domain.bat script.
    <br /><br />
    To start the JBoss server in standalone
    mode, the admin will execute /bin/standalone.bat or standalone.sh.
    <br /><br />
    Command line
    flags are used to specify which network address is used for management and which
    address is used for public/application access.

ocil: |-
    If JBoss is not started with separate management and public interfaces, this is
    a finding.
    <br /><br />
    Review the network design documents to identify the IP address space
    for the management network.
    <br /><br />
    Use relevant OS commands and administrative
    techniques to determine how the system administrator starts the JBoss server.
    This includes interviewing the system admin, using the <pre>ps -ef|grep</pre>
    command for UNIX like systems or checking command line flags and properties on
    batch scripts for Windows systems.
    <br /><br />
    Ensure the startup syntax used to start
    JBoss specifies a management network address and a public network address.
    <br /><br />
    The
    <tt>-b</tt> flag specifies the public address space.
    The
    <tt>-bmanagement</tt> flag specifies the management address space.
    <br /><br />
    Example:
    <pre>
    &lt;JBOSS_HOME&gt;/bin/standalone.sh -bmanagement 10.10.10.35 -b 192.168.10.25
    </pre>
    <br /><br />
    If
    JBoss is not started with separate management and public interfaces, this is a
    finding.
