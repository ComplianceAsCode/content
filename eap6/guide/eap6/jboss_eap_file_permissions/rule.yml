title: 'Configure JBoss Application File Permissions'

description: |-
    Configure file permissions on the JBoss folder to protect from unauthorized
    access.

rationale: |-
    The JBoss EAP Application Server is a Java-based AS. It is installed on the OS
    file system and depends upon file system access controls to protect application
    data at rest. The file permissions set on the JBoss EAP home folder must be
    configured so as to limit access to only authorized people and processes. The
    account used for operating the JBoss server and any designated administrative or
    operational accounts are the only accounts that should have access.
    <br /><br />
    When data
    is written to digital media such as hard drives, mobile computers,
    external/removable hard drives, personal digital assistants, flash/thumb drives,
    etc., there is risk of data loss and data compromise. Steps must be taken to
    ensure data stored on the device is protected.

ocil: |-
    By default, JBoss installs its files into a folder called <tt>jboss-eap-6.3</tt>.
    This folder by default is stored within the home folder of the JBoss user
    account. The installation process, however, allows for the override of default
    values to obtain folder and user account information from the system admin.
    <br /><br />
    Log
    on with a user account with JBoss access and permissions.
    <br /><br />
    Navigate to the <tt>Jboss-eap-6.3</tt>
    folder using the relevant OS commands for either a UNIX-
    like OS or a Windows OS.
    <br /><br />
    Examine the permissions of the JBoss folder.
    <br /><br />
    Owner can be full access. Group can be full access.
    All others must be restricted to
    execute access or no permission.
    <br /><br />
    If the JBoss folder is world readable or world
    writeable, this is a finding.
