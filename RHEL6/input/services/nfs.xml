<title>NFS and RPC</title>
<description>The Network File System is the most popular distributed filesystem for the Unix environment, and is very widely deployed. Unfortunately, NFS was not designed with security in mind, and has a number of weaknesses, both in terms of the protocol itself and because any NFS installation must expose several daemons, running on both servers and clients, to network attack.
<br /><br />
This section discusses the circumstances under which it is possible to disable NFS and its dependencies, and then details steps which should be taken to secure, as much as possible, NFS's configuration. This section is relevant to machines operating as NFS clients, as well as to those operating as NFS
servers.</description>

<description>Is there a mission-critical reason for this machine to operate as either an NFS client or an NFS server?

If not, follow all instructions in the remainder of this section to disable subsystems required by NFS.
<br /><br />
NFS is a commonly used mechanism for sharing data between machines in an organization. However, its use opens many potential security holes. If NFS is not universally needed in your organization, improve the security posture of any machine which does not require NFS by disabling it entirely.</description>

then disable the RPC bind service.
<br /><br />
By design, the RPC model does not require particular services to listen on fixed ports, but instead uses a daemon, rpcbind, to tell prospective clients which ports to use to contact the services they are trying to reach. This model weakens system security by introducing another privileged daemon which may be directly attacked, and is unnecessary because RPC was never adopted by enough services to risk using up all the ports on a system.
<br /><br />
Unfortunately, rpcbind is central to RPC design, so it cannot be disabled if your site is using NFSv3 or NFSv2, NIS (see Section 3.2.4 for information about NIS, which is not recommended), or any third-party or custom RPC-based program. If none of these programs are in use, however, rpcbind should be disabled to improve system security.
<br /><br />
In order to get more information about whether rpcbind may be disabled on a given host, query rpcbind using the command:
<pre># rpcinfo -p</pre>
If the only services listed are portmapper and status, it is safe to disable rpcbind. If other services are listed and your site is not running NFS or NIS, investigate these services and disable them if possible.</description>

<description>If NFS must be used, it should be deployed in the simplest configuration possible to avoid maintainability problems which may lead to unnecessary security exposure. Due to the reliability and security problems caused
by NFS (specially NFSv3 and NFSv2), it is not a good idea for machines which act as NFS servers to also mount filesystems via NFS. At the least, crossed mounts (the situation in which each of two servers mounts a filesystem from the other) should never be used.

<title>Restrict Access to rpcbind</title>
<description>When using NFSv2 or NFSv3 which require <tt>rpcbind</tt>, access to the <tt>rpcbind</tt> service should be restricted by using TCP Wrappers. The <tt>/etc/hosts.allow</tt> and <tt>/etc/hosts.deny</tt> files are used by TCP Wrappers to determine whether specified remote hosts are allowed to access certain services. The default RPC Bind service shipped with RHEL6 has TCP Wrappers support built in, so this specification can be used to provide some protection against network attacks on <tt>rpcbind</tt>.
<br /><br />
Note: This step protects only the RPC Bind service itself. It is still possible for attackers to guess the port numbers of NFS services and attack those services directly, even if they are denied access to <tt>rpcbind</tt>.
<br /><br />
Edit the file <tt>/etc/hosts.deny</tt>. Add or correct the line:
<pre>rpcbind: ALL</pre>
Edit the file <tt>/etc/hosts.allow</tt>. Add or correct the line:
<pre>rpcbind: IPADDR1 , IPADDR2 , ...</pre>
where each <tt>IPADDR</tt> is the IP address of a server or client with which this machine shares NFS filesystems. If the machine is an NFS server, it may be simpler to use an IP netblock specification, such as 10.3.2. (this is the TCP Wrappers syntax representing the netblock 10.3.2.0/24), or a hostname specification, such as
.subdomain.example.com. The use of hostnames is not recommended.

<title>Configure NFS Services to Use Fixed Ports (NFSv3 and NFSv2)</title>
<description>Firewalling should be done at each host and at the border firewalls to protect the NFS daemons from remote access, since NFS servers should never be accessible from outside the organization. However, by default for NFSv3 and NFSv2, the RPC Bind service assigns each NFS service to a port dynamically at service startup time. Dynamic ports cannot be protected by port filtering firewalls such as iptables.
<br /><br />
Therefore, restrict each service to always use a given port, so that firewalling can be done effectively. Note that, because of the way RPC is implemented, it is not possible to disable the RPC Bind service even if ports are assigned statically to all RPC services.
<br /><br />
In NFSv4, the mounting and locking protocols have been incorporated into the protocol, and the server listens on the the well-known TCP port 2049. As such, NFSv4 does not need to interact with the <tt>rpcbind, lockd, and rpc.statd</tt> daemons, which can and should be disabled in a pure NFSv4 environment. The <tt>rpc.mountd</tt> daemon is still required on the NFS server to setup exports, but is not involved in any over-the-wire operations.
