<description>The Network File System is a popular distributed filesystem for
the Unix environment, and is very widely deployed.  This section discusses the
circumstances under which it is possible to disable NFS and its dependencies,
and then details steps which should be taken to secure
NFS's configuration. This section is relevant to machines operating as NFS
clients, as well as to those operating as NFS servers.

By design, the RPC model does not require particular services to listen on
fixed ports, but instead uses a daemon, rpcbind, to tell prospective clients
which ports to use to contact the services they are trying to reach. This model
weakens system security by introducing another privileged daemon which may be
directly attacked, and is unnecessary because RPC was never adopted by enough
services to risk using up all the ports on a system.  Unfortunately, rpcbind is
central to RPC design, so it cannot be disabled if your site is using NFSv3 or
NFSv2, NIS (see Section 3.2.4 for information about NIS, which is not
recommended), or any third-party or custom RPC-based program. If none of these
programs are in use, however, rpcbind should be disabled to improve system
security.  In order to get more information about whether rpcbind may be
disabled on a given host, query rpcbind using the command:
<pre># rpcinfo -p</pre>
If the only services listed are portmapper and status, it is safe to disable
rpcbind. If other services are listed and your site is not running NFS or NIS,
investigate these services and disable them if possible.

<description>If NFS must be used, it should be deployed in the simplest
configuration possible to avoid maintainability problems which may lead to
unnecessary security exposure. Due to the reliability and security problems
caused by NFS (specially NFSv3 and NFSv2), it is not a good idea for machines
which act as NFS servers to also mount filesystems via NFS. At the least,
crossed mounts (the situation in which each of two servers mounts a filesystem
from the other) should never be used.

<title>Restrict Access to rpcbind</title>
<description>When using NFSv2 or NFSv3 which require <tt>rpcbind</tt>, access
to the <tt>rpcbind</tt> service should be restricted by using TCP Wrappers. The
<tt>/etc/hosts.allow</tt> and <tt>/etc/hosts.deny</tt> files are used by TCP
Wrappers to determine whether specified remote hosts are allowed to access
certain services. The default RPC Bind service shipped with RHEL6 has TCP
Wrappers support built in, so this specification can be used to provide some
protection against network attacks on <tt>rpcbind</tt>.
<br /><br />
Note: This step protects only the RPC Bind service itself. It is still possible
for attackers to guess the port numbers of NFS services and attack those
services directly, even if they are denied access to <tt>rpcbind</tt>.
<br /><br />
Edit the file <tt>/etc/hosts.deny</tt>. Add or correct the line:
<pre>rpcbind: ALL</pre>
Edit the file <tt>/etc/hosts.allow</tt>. Add or correct the line:
<pre>rpcbind: IPADDR1 , IPADDR2 , ...</pre>
where each <tt>IPADDR</tt> is the IP address of a server or client with which
this machine shares NFS filesystems. If the machine is an NFS server, it may be
simpler to use an IP netblock specification, such as 10.3.2. (this is the TCP
Wrappers syntax representing the netblock 10.3.2.0/24), or a hostname
specification, such as .subdomain.example.com. The use of hostnames is not
recommended.  </description>

<Group id="nfs_configure_fixed_ports">
<title>Configure NFS Services to Use Fixed Ports (NFSv3 and NFSv2)</title>
<description>Firewalling should be done at each host and at the border
firewalls to protect the NFS daemons from remote access, since NFS servers
should never be accessible from outside the organization. However, by default
for NFSv3 and NFSv2, the RPC Bind service assigns each NFS service to a port
dynamically at service startup time. Dynamic ports cannot be protected by port
filtering firewalls such as iptables.
<br /><br />
Therefore, restrict each service to always use a given port, so that
firewalling can be done effectively. Note that, because of the way RPC is
implemented, it is not possible to disable the RPC Bind service even if ports
are assigned statically to all RPC services.
<br /><br />
In NFSv4, the mounting and locking protocols have been incorporated into the
protocol, and the server listens on the the well-known TCP port 2049. As such,
NFSv4 does not need to interact with the <tt>rpcbind, lockd, and rpc.statd</tt>
daemons, which can and should be disabled in a pure NFSv4 environment. The
<tt>rpc.mountd</tt> daemon is still required on the NFS server to setup
exports, but is not involved in any over-the-wire operations.
