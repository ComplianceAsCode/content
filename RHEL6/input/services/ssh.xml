<title>SSH Server</title>
<description>The SSH protocol is recommended for remote login and
remote file transfer. SSH provides confidentiality and integrity
for data exchanged between two systems, as well as server
authentication, through the use of public key cryptography. The
implementation included with the system is called OpenSSH, and more
detailed documentation is available from its website,
http://www.openssh.org. Its server program is called <tt>sshd</tt> and
provided by the RPM package <tt>openssh-server</tt>.</description>

<description>SSH allows administrators to set an idle timeout

To set an idle timeout interval, edit the following line in <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt> as

The timeout <b>interval</b> is given in seconds. To have a timeout
of 15 minutes, set <b>interval</b> to 900.

If a shorter timeout has already been set for the login
shell, that value will preempt any SSH
setting made here. Keep in mind that some processes may stop SSH
from correctly detecting that the user is idle.
