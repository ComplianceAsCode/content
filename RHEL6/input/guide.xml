<title>Guide to the Secure Configuration of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6</title>
<description>This guide provides a comprehensive catalog of security-relevant
configuration settings for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.  It is a catalog, not a
checklist, and satisfaction of every item is not likely to be possible or advisable
in many operational scenarios.
<br/>
Providing system administrators with such guidance informs them how to securely
configure systems under their control in a variety of network roles.  Policy
makers and baseline creators can use this catalog of settings, with its
associated references to higher-level security control catalogs, in order
to assist them in security baseline creation. The XCCDF format enables granular
selection and adjustment of settings, and their association with OVAL and OCIL
content provides an automated checking capability.  Transformations of this
document, and its associated automated checking content, are capable of
providing baselines that meet a diverse set of policy objectives.

this guide without first testing them in a non-operational environment. The
