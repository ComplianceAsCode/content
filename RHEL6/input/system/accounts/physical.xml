<title>Protect Physical Console Access</title>
<description>It is impossible to fully protect a system from an
attacker with physical access, so securing the space in which the
system is located should be considered a necessary step. However,
there are some steps which, if taken, make it more difficult for an
attacker to quickly or undetectably modify a system from its
console.</description>

<Group id="bootloader">
<title>Set Boot Loader Password</title>
<description>During the boot process, the boot loader is
responsible for starting the execution of the kernel and passing
options to it. The boot loader allows for the selection of
different kernels - possibly on different partitions or media.
The default RHEL boot loader for x86 systems is called GRUB.
Options it can pass to the kernel include <i>single-user mode</i>, which
provides root access without any authentication, and the ability to
disable SELinux. To prevent local users from modifying the boot
parameters and endangering security, protect the boot loader configuration
with a password and ensure its configuration file's permissions
are set properly.

<title>Configure Screen Locking</title>
<description>When a user must temporarily leave an account
logged-in, screen locking should be employed to prevent passersby
from abusing the account. User education and training is
particularly important for screen locking to be effective, and policies
can be implemented to reinforce this.
<br /><br />
Automatic screen locking is only meant as a safeguard for
those cases where a user forgot to lock the screen.</description>

<Group id="gui_screen_locking">
<title>Configure GUI Screen Locking</title>
<description>In the default GNOME desktop, the screen can be locked
by choosing <b>Lock Screen</b> from the <b>System</b> menu.
<br /><br />
The <tt>gconftool-2</tt> program can be used to enforce mandatory
screen locking settings for the default GNOME environment.
The
following sections detail commands to enforce idle activation of the screen saver,
screen locking, a blank-screen screensaver, and an idle
activation time.

<br /><br />
Because users should be trained to lock the screen when they
step away from the computer, the automatic locking feature is only
meant as a backup. The Lock Screen icon from the System menu can
also be dragged to the taskbar in order to facilitate even more
convenient screen-locking.
<br /><br />
The root account cannot be screen-locked, but this should
<!-- TODO: is this still true? -->have no practical effect as the root account should <i>never</i> be used
to log into an X Windows environment, and should only be used to
for direct login via console in emergency circumstances.
