<title>Protect Accounts by Configuring PAM</title>
<description>PAM, or Pluggable Authentication Modules, is a system
which implements modular authentication for Linux programs. PAM provides
a flexible and configurable architecture for authentication, and it should be configured
to minimize exposure to unnecessary risk. This section contains
guidance on how to accomplish that.
<br /><br />
PAM is implemented as a set of shared objects which are
loaded and invoked whenever an application wishes to authenticate a
user. Typically, the application must be running as root in order
to take advantage of PAM, because PAM's modules often need to be able
to access sensitive stores of account information, such as /etc/shadow.
Traditional privileged network listeners
(e.g. sshd) or SUID programs (e.g. sudo) already meet this
requirement. An SUID root application, userhelper, is provided so
that programs which are not SUID or privileged themselves can still
take advantage of PAM.
<br /><br />
PAM looks in the directory <tt>/etc/pam.d</tt> for
application-specific configuration information. For instance, if
the program login attempts to authenticate a user, then PAM's
libraries follow the instructions in the file <tt>/etc/pam.d/login</tt>
to determine what actions should be taken.
<br /><br />
One very important file in <tt>/etc/pam.d</tt> is
<tt>/etc/pam.d/system-auth</tt>. This file, which is included by
many other PAM configuration files, defines 'default' system authentication
measures. Modifying this file is a good way to make far-reaching
authentication changes, for instance when implementing a
centralized authentication service.</description>
<warning category="general">Be careful when making changes to PAM's
configuration files. The syntax for these files is complex, and
modifications can have unexpected consequences. The default
configurations shipped with applications should be sufficient for
most users.</warning>
<warning category="general">Running <tt>authconfig</tt> or
<tt>system-config-authentication</tt> will re-write the PAM configuration
files, destroying any manually made changes and replacing them with
a series of system defaults. One reference to the configuration
file syntax can be found at
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/Linux-PAM-html/sag-configuration-file.html.</warning>

<title>Set Password Quality Requirements</title>
<description>The default <tt>pam_cracklib</tt> PAM module provides strength
checking for passwords. It performs a number of checks, such as
making sure passwords are not similar to dictionary words, are of
at least a certain length, are not the previous password reversed,
and are not simply a change of case from the previous password. It
can also require passwords to be in certain character classes.
<br /><br />
The <tt>pam_passwdqc</tt> PAM module also provides the ability to enforce
stringent password strength requirements. It is provided
in an RPM of the same name.
<br /><br />
The man pages <tt>pam_cracklib(8)</tt> and <tt>pam_passwdqc(8)</tt>
provide information on the capabilities and configuration of
each.</description>

<Group id="password_quality_pamcracklib">
<title>Set Password Quality Requirements, if using
pam_cracklib</title>
<description>The <tt>pam_cracklib</tt> PAM module can be configured to meet
requirements for a variety of policies.
<br /><br />
For example, to configure <tt>pam_cracklib</tt> to require at least one uppercase
character, lowercase character, digit, and other (special)
character, locate the following line in <tt>/etc/pam.d/system-auth</tt>:
<pre>password requisite pam_cracklib.so try_first_pass retry=3</pre>
and then alter it to read:
<pre>password required pam_cracklib.so try_first_pass retry=3 minlen=14 dcredit=-1 ucredit=-1 ocredit=-1 lcredit=0</pre>
The arguments can be modified to ensure compliance with
your organization's security policy. Discussion of each parameter follows.
