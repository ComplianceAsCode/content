<title>Updating Software</title>
<description>The <tt>yum</tt> command line tool is used to install and
update software packages. The system also provides two graphical
package managers, <tt>pirut</tt> and <tt>pup</tt>. The <tt>pirut</tt>
tool is a graphical front-end for <tt>yum</tt> that allows users to install
and update packages while <tt>pup</tt> is a simple update tool for packages
that are already installed. In the <b>Applications</b> menu, <tt>pirut</tt>
is labeled <b>Add/Remove Software</b> and pup is labeled
<b>Software Updater</b>.
<br /><br />
Red Hat Enteprise Linux systems contain an embedded Installed Software
Catalog, or "RPM Database," which records metadata of installed packages.
The <tt>yum</tt>, <tt>pirut</tt>, and <tt>pup</tt> tools interface
with the Installed Software Catalog to ensure all system metadata is
accurate with regard to installed software and security patches, and
for this reason, their use is strongly encouraged.

<title>Ensure Red Hat GPG Key Installed</title>
<description>
To ensure that the system can cryptographically verify base
software packages come from Red Hat (and to connect to the Red
Hat Network to receive them if desired), the Red Hat GPG key
must properly be installed. Run the following command to
install the Red Hat GPG key, of which Red Hat uses to sign
publically released software:

<pre>$ rpm -q --queryformat "%{SUMMARY}\n" gpg-pubkey</pre>
The command should return the string:
<pre>gpg(Red Hat, Inc. (release key &lt;security@redhat.com&gt;)</pre>

<rationale>
This key is necessary to cryptographically verify that packages
are from Red Hat.

<title>Ensure gpgcheck Enabled In Main Yum Configuration</title>

them, ensure that the following line appears in <tt>/etc/yum.conf</tt> in
the <tt>[main]</tt> section:
