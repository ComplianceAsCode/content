<title>Software Integrity Checking</title>
<description>
Both the AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment)
software and the RPM package management system provide
mechanisms for verifying the integrity of installed software.
AIDE is the successor to the well-known Tripwire integrity
checker. The RPM package management system can conduct integrity
checks by comparing information in its metadata database with
files installed on the system.
<br /><br />
Integrity checking cannot <i>prevent</i> intrusions into your
system, but can detect that they have occurred. Requirements
for software integrity checking may be highly dependent on
the environment in which the system will be used.

<title>Verify Integrity with AIDE</title>
<description>AIDE conducts integrity checks by comparing information
about files with previously-gathered information. Ideally, the AIDE
database should be created immediately after your system is built,
and before the system is connected to any network. AIDE is highly
configurable, with further configuration information located in

<description>Run the following command to generate a new database:
<pre># /usr/sbin/aide --init</pre>
By default, the database will be written to the file <tt>/var/lib/aide/aide.db.new.gz</tt>.
Storing the database, the configuration file <tt>/etc/aide.conf</tt>, and the binary
<tt>/usr/sbin/aide</tt> (or hashes of these files), in a secure location (such as on read-only media) provides additional assurance about their integrity.
The newly-generated database can be installed as follows:
<pre># cp /var/lib/aide/aide.db.new.gz /var/lib/aide/aide.db.gz</pre>
To initiate a manual check, run the following command:
<pre># /usr/sbin/aide --check</pre>
If this check produces any unexpected output, investigate.

For AIDE to be effective, an initial database of "known-good" information about files

<title>Manually Verify Integrity of AIDE</title>
<description>
Manually verify the integrity of the AIDE binaries, configuration file, and database. Possibilities for doing
so include:
<br /><br />
1. Use sha1sum or md5sum to generate checksums on the files and then visually compare them to those
generated from the safely stored versions. This does not, of course, preclude the possibility that such
output could also be faked.
<br /><br />
2. Mount the stored versions on read-only media and run <tt>/bin/diff</tt> to verify that there are no differences
between the files.
<br /><br />
3. Copying the files to another system and performing the hash or file comparisons there may impart
additional confidence that the manual verification process is not being interfered with.
</description>
<rationale>
Because integrity checking is a means of intrusion detection and not intrusion prevention, it cannot be guaranteed
that the AIDE binaries, configuration files, or database have not been tampered with. An attacker could disable
or alter these files after a successful intrusion. Because of this, manual and frequent checks on these files is
recommended. The safely stored copies (or hashes) of the database, binary, and configuration file were created
earlier for this purpose.

<title>Verify Integrity with RPM</title>
<description>The RPM package management system includes the ability
to verify the integrity of installed packages by comparing the
installed files with information about the files taken from the
package metadata stored in the RPM database. Although an attacker
could corrupt the RPM database (analogous to attacking the AIDE
database as described above), this check can still reveal
modification of important files. To list which files on the system differ from what is expected by the RPM database:
<pre># rpm -qVa</pre>
See the man page for <tt>rpm</tt> to see a complete explanation of each column.

<title>Install Intrusion Detection Software</title>
<description>
The base Red Hat platform already includes a sophisticated auditing system that
can detect intruder activity, as well as SELinux, which provides host-based
intrusion prevention capabilities by confining privileged programs and user
sessions which may become compromised.
<br/>
<br/>
Install an additional intrusion detection tool to provide complementary or
duplicative monitoring, reporting, and reaction capabilities to those of the base
platform.  For DoD systems, the McAfee Host-based Security System is provided
to fulfill this role.  
<!-- provide link to cybercom site? -->

Adding host-based intrusion detection tools can provide the capability to
automatically take actions in response to malicious behavior, which can provide
additional agility in reacting to network threats. These tools also often
include a reporting capability to provide network awareness of system, which

Install virus scanning software, which uses signatures to search for the
presence of viruses on the filesystem. 
The McAfee uvscan virus scanning tool is provided for DoD systems.
Ensure virus definition files are no older than 7 days, or their last release.
<!-- need info here on where DoD admins can go to get this -->
Configure the virus scanning software to perform scans dynamically on all
accessed files.  If this is not possible, configure the
system to scan all altered files on the system on a daily
basis. If the system processes inbound SMTP mail, configure the virus scanner
to scan all received mail.

<pre># grep uvscan /etc/cron* /var/spool/cron/*</pre>
This will reveal if and when the uvscan program will be run.
