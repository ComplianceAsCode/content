<title>File Permissions and Masks</title>
<description>Traditional Unix security relies heavily on file and
directory permissions to prevent unauthorized users from reading or
modifying files to which they should not have access. Adhere to the
principle of least privilege â€” configure each file, directory, and
filesystem to allow only the access needed in order for that file
to serve its purpose.
<br /><br />
Note: Several of the commands in this section search filesystems
for files or directories with certain characteristics, and are
intended to be run on every local partition on a given machine.
When the variable <i>PART</i> appears in one of the commands below,
it means that the command is intended to be run repeatedly, with the
name of each local partition substituted for <i>PART</i> in turn.
<br /><br />
The following command prints a list of ext4 partitions on the local
machine, which is the default filesystem for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
6 installations.
<pre>$ mount -t ext4 | awk '{print $3}'</pre>
If your site uses a local filesystem type other than ext4 then you
will need to modify this command.</description>
