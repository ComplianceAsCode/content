<title>Restrict Dynamic Mounting and Unmounting of
Filesystems</title>
<description>Linux includes a number of facilities for the
automated addition and removal of filesystems on a running system.
These facilities may increase convenience, but they all bring some
risk, whether direct risk from allowing unprivileged users to
introduce arbitrary filesystems to a machine, or risk that software
flaws in the automated mount facility itself will allow an attacker
to compromise the system.
<br /><br />
This command can be used to list the types of filesystems that are
available to the currently executing kernel:
<pre># find /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/fs -type f -name '*.ko'</pre>
If these filesystems are not required then they should be explicitly disabled
in the appropriate <tt>/etc/modprobe.d</tt> configuration file.
<br /><br />
Use caution when enabling any such facility, and find out
whether better configuration management or user education might
solve the same problem with less risk.</description>

<title>Remove USB Storage Driver</title>
<description>If your system never requires the use of USB storage devices, then the
supporting driver can be permanently removed. Though more effective than disabling the
module within modprobe, this solution is less elegant than the modprobe method described
in "Disable Modprobe Loading of USB". The technique described here will cause the
command <tt>rpm -V kernel</tt> to fail which may be an undesirable side effect.
<br /><br />
To permanently remove the USB storage driver from the system execute this command:
<pre># rm /lib/modules/<i>KERNEL-VERSION</i>/kernel/drivers/usb/storage/usb-storage.ko</pre>
The variable <tt><i>KERNEL-VERSION</i></tt> can be determined using the <tt>uname -r</tt>
command which returns the version of the currently loaded kernel. The <tt>rm</tt> command
will need to be repeated every time the kernel is updated.</description>

<title>Disable the Automounter</title>
<description>The <tt>autofs</tt> daemon mounts and unmounts filesystems, such as user
home directories shared via NFS, on demand. In addition, autofs can be used to handle
removable media, and the default configuration provides the cdrom device as <tt>/misc/cd</tt>.
However, this method of providing access to removable media is not common, so autofs
can almost always be disabled if NFS is not in use. Even if NFS is required, it is
almost always possible to configure filesystem mounts statically by editing <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>
rather than relying on the automounter.
<br /><br />
If the <tt>autofs</tt> service is not needed to dynamically mount NFS filesystems
or removable media, disable the service for all runlevels:
<pre># chkconfig --level 0123456 autofs off</pre>
</description>
<ocil clause="it does not">
To verify that the <tt>autofs</tt> service is disabled, run the following command:
<pre>chkconfig --list autofs</pre>

DVDs.
