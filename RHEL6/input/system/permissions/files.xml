<title>Verify Permissions on Important Files and
Directories</title>
<description>Permissions for many files on a system must be set
restrictively to ensure sensitive information is properly protected.
This section discusses important
permission restrictions which can be verified
to ensure that no harmful discrepancies have
arisen.</description>

<title>Verify Permissions on Files with Local Account Information and Credentials</title>
<description>The default restritctive permissions for files which act as
important security databases such as <tt>passwd</tt>, <tt>shadow</tt>,
<tt>group</tt>, and <tt>gshadow</tt> files must be maintained.  Many utilities
need read access to the <tt>passwd</tt> file in order to function properly, but
read access to the <tt>shadow</tt> file allows malicious attacks against system
passwords, and should never be enabled.</description>

<description>Some directories contain files whose confidentiality or integrity
is notably important and may also be susceptible to misconfiguration over time, particularly if

<Rule id="sticky_world_writable_dirs">
<title>Verify that All World-Writable Directories Have Sticky Bits Set</title>
<description>When the so-called 'sticky bit' is set on a directory,
only the owner of a given file may remove that file from the
directory. Without the sticky bit, any user with write access to a
directory may remove any file in the directory. Setting the sticky
bit prevents users from removing each other's files. In cases where
there is no reason for a directory to be world-writable, a better
solution is to remove that permission rather than to set the sticky
bit. However, if a directory is used by a particular application,
consult that application's documentation instead of blindly
changing modes.
<br/>
To set the sticky bit on a world-writable directory <i>DIR</i>, run the
following command:
<pre># chmod +t <i>DIR</i></pre>

<description>Data in world-writable files can be modified by any

It is generally a good idea to remove global (other) write
access to a file when it is discovered. However, check with
documentation for specific applications before making changes.
Also, monitor for recurring world-writable files, as these may be
symptoms of a misconfigured application or user
