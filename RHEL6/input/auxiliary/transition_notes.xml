This could be covered in the RHEL6 content itself, though it seems more like something appropriate for a CTO

Current mapping does not meet requirement as it works for passwords, not keys
Per Steve Grubb there is a patch coming to enable this through PAM, so we can map to met_inherently in RHEL 6.4
