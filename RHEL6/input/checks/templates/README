These templates are designed to make generation of OVAL tests
which have repetitive structure easier.

For example:

./create_services_disabled.py services_disabled.csv

Should produce all the OVAL checks (in a shorthand format)
to disable services in the output folder.

The CSV input files should contain all the relevant information
for each check.  Files should be compared to existing OVAL checks
for consistency before copying to the main checks directory.
