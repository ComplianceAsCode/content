OVAL checks here are currently defined in individual files of well-formed 
XML, each of which contains the elements necessary to conduct the check.  
Each file consists of one definition and the tests, states, objects and 
variables upon which it depends.

When developing new OVAL content make sure that IDs assigned to new 
definitions, tests, objects, states, and variables are unique and not 
replicated in any other OVAL check in this directory.  The presence of 
duplicate IDs will result in a "Duplicate ID" warning being printed when 
the "make all" command is issued. Because each of these XML files is 
eventually concatenated and reordered to create a valid OVAL document, 
the presence of duplicate IDs can introduce errors when evaluating the 
OVAL content.  Please note that there may be times when it makes sense
to duplicate an object assuming that the object is *exactly* the same
across OVAL checks.  This warning is meant to discourage the accidental
introduction of duplicate IDs.

Interrogatory checks (which cannot be automated) may be defined in the 
OCIL language and stored here.

As soon as it supports newer OVAL versions, checks may also be defined in 
(or replaced by translations of) the SC language and compiled into OVAL 
using the scc tool. More information is available at:
