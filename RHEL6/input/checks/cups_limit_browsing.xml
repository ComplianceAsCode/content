      <description>By default, when printer sharing is enabled, CUPS will broadcast to every network that its host machine is connected to through all available network interfaces on port 631. It will also listen to incoming broadcasts from other machines on the network. Either list one BrowseAddress line for each client machine and one BrowseAllow line for each print server or use one of the supported shorthand notations that the CUPS service recognizes. Please see the cupsd.conf(5) man page or the documentation provided at http://www.cups.org for more information on other ways to format these directives.</description>
