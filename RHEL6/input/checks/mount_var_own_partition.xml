      <description>Ensuring that /var is mounted on its own partition enables the
      setting of more restrictive mount options, which is used as temporary
      storage by many program, particularly system services such as daemons.
      It is not uncommon for the /var directory to contain world-writable directories,
      installed by other software packages.</description>
