# In BSI Basic Protection there are multiple Requirements in one control.
# i.e. there are multiple sentences, some including a RFC2119 keyword
# Since we must increase granularity to create a precise control,
# we number each sentence with a RFC2119 keyword as a section, grouping sentences, which are logically connected.
# we number inline in brackets, so the lookup is easy

      Checking RPM integrity, with rpm_verify_hashes, rpm_verify_ownership and
      rpm_verify_permissions is of no avail, since in OpenShift Container Platform,
      the Machine Config Operator handles operating system upgrades.
      Instead of upgrading individual packages, as is done with yum upgrades, rpm-ostree
      delivers upgrades of the OS as an atomic unit. The new OS deployment is staged
      during upgrades and goes into effect on the next reboot. If something goes wrong
      with the upgrade, a single rollback and reboot returns the system to the previous
      state. RHCOS upgrades in OpenShift Container Platform are performed during cluster

      scripts can be executed. (2) The rules SHOULD be set as restrictively as possible. (3) If explicit
      specification of paths and hashes is not possible, certificate-based or path rules SHOULD be
      used as an alternative.
    notes: >-
      While not directly leveraging a allowlist of executable programs, SELinux helps to
      address this issue. They deny execution or fileaccess based on a list of allowed permissions.
