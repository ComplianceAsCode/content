  title: {{{ full_name }}} must provide an immediate warning to the SA and ISSO
    (at a minimum) when allocated audit record storage volume reaches 75 percent of
    repository maximum audit record storage capacity.
  status: not applicable
  status_justification: |-
    Not applicable - The location of the external logging server
    used for audit log aggregation is outside the scope of OpenShift Container Platform
    configuration. Because the configuration recommended in response to SRG-APP-000111-CTR-000220
    configures an external log aggregation server outside of the control of the OpenShift
    cluster, it is up to individual implementation to ensure that the location of that
    log aggregation point meets other requirements.
