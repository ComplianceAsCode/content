    Verify that no insecure registries configured:

    $ oc get image.config.openshift.io/cluster -ojsonpath='{.spec.allowedRegistriesForImport}'

    If any registries set the "insecure: true" flag, this is a finding

    Also check:

    $ oc get image.config.openshift.io/cluster -ojsonpath='{.spec.registrySources}'

    If the results contain any "insecureRegistrySources", this is a finding

    Remove insecure registries from the cluster's image registry configuration

    $ oc edit image.config.openshift.io/cluster
