  status_justification: |-
    OpenShift does not execute containers with a user's account. Pods use service
    accounts to launch containers.  Service accounts are uniquely identified
    by project and name.  Service accounts provide a means to control access
    to the API without using the user's credentials. Service Accounts can be
    assigned roles defined and enforced by the RBAC policy.
