    on-demand reporting requirements.

  status_justification: |-
    Not applicable - The location of the external logging server used for audit
    log aggregation is outside the scope of {{{ full_name }}} configuration.
    Because the configuration recommended in response to SRG-APP-000111-CTR-000220
    configures an external log aggregation server outside of the control of the
    {{{ full_name }}} cluster, it is up to individual implementation to ensure that
    the location of that log aggregation point meets other requirements.
