  status_justification: |-
    The OpenShift Container Platform provides RBAC policies and enforcement of those policies out of the box.  Verification of SRG-APP-000340-CTR-000770 will ensure that binding of user and groups to roles provides proper restriction of access to resources. For more information on how RBAC policies work in OpenShift.

    Only users with cluster-admin priviliges are permitted to create, modify, or view platform identity providers stored within the Oauth custom resource defining identity provider configuration(s).
