    To determine at what level the OpenShift audit policy logging verbosity
    is configured, run the following command as a cluster-administrator:

    > oc get apiserver.config.openshift.io/cluster \
    -ojsonpath='{.spec.audit.profile}'

    If the output, from the options of Default, WriteRequestBodies, and
    AllRequestBodies, does not match the defined auditable event threshhold,
    this is a finding.
  fixtext: |-
    As the cluster administrator, update the
    APIServer.config.openshift.io/cluster object to set the profile to the
    defined level of detail. For example, to configure the profile to Write
    Request Bodies, meaning that all write requests to any API server object
    are logged in their entirety, run the following command:

    > oc patch apiserver.config.openshift.io/cluster --type=merge \ 
    -p '{"spec":{"audit": {"profile": "WriteRequestBodies"}}}'
