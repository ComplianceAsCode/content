    OpenShift must be configurated at the time of installation.  Because FIPS
    must be enabled before the operating system that your cluster uses boots
    for the first time, you cannot enable FIPS after you deploy a cluster. If
    a cluster is installed in FIPS mode, the nodes will indicate FIPS mode
    and this will propogate into the platform.

    To validate that the OpenShift cluster is running with FIPS enabled on
    each node run the command:

    > for node in $(oc get node -oname); \
    do oc debug $node -- chroot /host /bin/bash -c 'echo -n "$HOSTNAME "; \ 
    sysctl crypto.fips_enabled' 2>/dev/null; done

    If any lines of output end in anything other than a 1, this is a finding.

    Verify that the Cluster Log Forwarder is using an encrypted transport:

    > oc get clusterlogforwarder -n openshift-logging

    For each Cluster Log Forwarder, run the following command to display the configuration

    > oc describe clusterlogforwarder <name> -n openshift-logging

    Review the configuration and determine if the transport is secure, such
    as tls:// or https://. If there are any tranports configured that are
    not secured by TLS, this is a finding.
  fixtext: |-
    Reinstall the OpenShift cluster in FIPS mode. The file install-config.yaml
    has a top level key that enables FIPS mode for all nodes and the cluster
    platform layer. If your install-config.yaml was not backed up prior to
    consumption as part of the installation, you will need to recreate it. An
    example install-config.yaml with some sections trimmed out for brevity,
    and the "fips: true" key applied at the top level is shown below:

    apiVersion: v1 baseDomain: example.com controlPlane:
      name: master platform:
        aws:
          [...]
      replicas: 3
    compute: - name: worker
      platform:
        aws:
      replicas: 3
    metadata:
      name: fips-cluster
    networking:
      [...]
    platform:
      aws:
        [...]
    sshKey: ssh-ed25519 AAAA...  pullSecret: '{"auths": ...}' fips: true

    Once you have saved the install-config.yaml with corresponding
    correct information for your installation infrastructure, run the
    installer to create a cluster that uses FIPS Validated / Modules in
    Process cryptographic libraries. The command to install a cluster and
    consume the install-config.yaml is: 
    > ./openshift-install create cluster --dir=<installation_directory> \
    --log-level=info 
    Where <installation_directory> is the directory that contains install-config.yaml

    Edit the Cluster Log Forwarder configuration to configure TLS on the transport.

    > oc edit clusterlogforwarder <name> -n openshift-logging

    configuration of the Cluster Log Forwarder see
