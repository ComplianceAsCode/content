    Verify that each user namespace has a Network Policy

    1. Get a list of existing projects(namespaces)

    > oc get projects

    2. For each user namespace (exclude default, kube-*, openshift-*) verify
    that one or more Network Policy objects exist.

    > oc get NetworkPolicy -n <PROJECT>

    If a project does not have any NetworkPolicy definitions, this is a finding.

    Configure a default network policy as necessary to protect the flow of
    information by performing the following steps.

    1. Create a networkpolicy.yaml file with the NetworkPolicy object
    definitions desired. For example, the following section defines two
    policies one to allow requests from the same namespace, the other to
    allow from the openshift ingress routing service.

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: List
    items:
    - apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
      kind: NetworkPolicy
      metadata:
        name: allow-from-same-namespace
      spec:
        podSelector:
        ingress:
        - from:
          - podSelector: {}
    - apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
      kind: NetworkPolicy
      metadata:
        name: allow-from-openshift-ingress
      spec:
        ingress:
        - from:
          - namespaceSelector:
              matchLabels:
                network.openshift.io/policy-group: ingress
        podSelector: {}
        policyTypes:
        - Ingress

    3. Apply the NetworkPolicy object to the appropriate namespaces by
    running the following command:

    > oc apply -f networkpolicy.yaml -n <PROJECT>
