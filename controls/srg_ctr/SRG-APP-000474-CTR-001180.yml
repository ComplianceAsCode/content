    If the OpenShift Compliance Operator is configured in accordance with
    the Fix data in SRG-APP-000516-CTR-001325, then administrators will be
    able to query when a ComplianceCheckResult shows non-compliant status
    for any of the rules defined in the compliance profile, aligning with
    the SSP for the system.

    This capability does not currently natively support alerting for
    non-compliant status. External tooling, such as Red Hat Advanced Cluster
    Security or compliance solutions from other vendors, may be integrated
    using their own mechanisms to provide active alerts conditionally.
  mitigation: |-
    Use external tooling, such as Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security or
    compliance solutions from other vendors to provide active alerts
    conditionally. Applying an external tool mitigates this risk to a
    CAT III.
