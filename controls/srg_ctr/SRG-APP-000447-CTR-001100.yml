  status_justification: All changes to the system go through API Server which is protected
    through transport security (TLS), as well as authentication, authorization, and additional
    admission controllers. These security mechanisms are configured out of the box with
    strong security controls but can be even further limited to enforce least privilege.
    Additionally, the API Server safeguards against unintended consequences by rejecting
    invalid inputs and creating audit records of API events. Alerts and logs and also
    be setup to display changes of API events.
