    The OpenShift Container Platform provides RBAC policies and enforcement of those policies out of the box.  Verification of SRG-APP-000340-CTR-000770 will ensure that binding of user and groups to roles provides proper restriction of access to resources. For more information on how RBAC policies work in OpenShift.

    OpenShift Container Platform stores private keys and certs as Secret objects within the platform. Access to those objects is enforced by the platform's RBAC policies.
