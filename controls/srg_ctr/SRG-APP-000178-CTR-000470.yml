  title: {{{ full_name }}} must obscure feedback of authentication information
    during the authentication process to protect the information from possible exploitation/use
    by unauthorized individuals.

    Supporting evidence is in the following documentation

    https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/index.html
  status_justification: |-
    The OpenShift Container Platform's web console hides the user's
    password as it is typed in. The CLI interface also hides the password as it is typed
    via standard input on the console.  To access the API server a user must first authenticate
    and obtain an OAuth token (or a x.509 certificate) in order send requests to the
    API server. In this way, the user's authentication credentials (username/password)
    are protected from discovery.
