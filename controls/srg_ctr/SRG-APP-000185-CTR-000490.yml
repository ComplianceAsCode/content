    Typically maintenence of the OpenShift Platform is performed remotely
    using the API server by means of the web console or cli tools. Access
    to host nodes is done either through SSH using SSH keys provided during
    install, or through the OpenShift CLI (oc) tool. Note, that applying
    SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227 will disable SSH access to the node's host
    machine. Thus limiting any remote management access to using only the
    API Server. The API server requires TLS encryption, and enforces the
    authentication and authorization policies configured on the platform.
