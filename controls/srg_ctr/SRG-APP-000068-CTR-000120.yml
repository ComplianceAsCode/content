    From a web browser, go to the Openshift web console to login (logout
    if already logged in). Verify that the DOD notice and consent banner is
    displayed before proceeding to the login page.

    If the DOD notice and consent banner is not displayed, this is a finding.

    To verify that the OpenShift CLI tool is configured to display the DoD 
    Notice and Consent Banner do eith of the following steps:

    Login to OpenShift using the oc cli tool

    > oc login -u <USER> <OPENSHIFT_URL>
    enter password when prompted

    If the DoD Notice and Consent Banner is not displayed, this is a finding.

    Or

    Verify that motd config map exists and contains the DoD Notice and Constent Banner

    > oc describe configmap/motd -n openshift

    If the configmap does not exist, or it does not contain the DoD Notice
    and Constent Banner text in the message data attribute, this is a finding.

    The following steps may be used to provide a custom login page that will
    diplay the DOD notice and consent banner. This will replace OpenShift's
    default login page and the login providers selection page. Please note
    that deending on the number and type of identity providers configured,
    it is possible that these pages will not be used. If that is the case,
    then it is the responsibility of the identity provider being used to
    display the DOD notice and consent banner.
    
    1. Create a login page template
    
    > oc adm create-login-template > login.html

    2. Create a providers page template
    
    > oc adm create-provider-selection-template > providers.html
    
    3. Edit each template to add the DOD notice and consent banner by adding
    the following lines at the end of the html body. In addition, any look
    and feel custimizations should also be applied to the pages.

        <script type="text/javascript">
          window.onload = function(){
                    alert("You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG)
                    Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized
                    use only. By using this IS (which includes any device
                    attached to this IS), you consent to the following
                    conditions:\n\n-The USG routinely intercepts and monitors
                    communications on this IS for purposes including, but
                    not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring,
                    network operations and defense, personnel misconduct
                    (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI)
                    investigations.\n\n-At any time, the USG may inspect and
                    seize data stored on this IS.\n\n-Communications using,
                    or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to
                    routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be
                    disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose.\n\n-This
                    IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and
                    access controls) to protect USG interests--not for your
                    personal benefit or privacy.\n\n-Notwithstanding the above,
                    using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE or
                    CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content
                    of privileged communications, or work product, related
                    to personal representation or services by attorneys,
                    psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants. Such
                    communications and work product are private and
                    confidential. See User Agreement for details.");
          }
        </script>

    4. Add custom login pages to OpenShift

    > oc create secret generic login-template --from-file=login.html \
    -n openshift-config > oc create secret generic providers-template \
    --from-file=providers.html -n openshift-config > oc patch oauths cluster \
    --type='json' -p '[{ "op":"add","path":"/spec/templates", \
    "value":{"login": { "name": "login-template" }, \
    "providerSelection": { "name": "providers-template" }}}]'
    
    The following command will create a configmap that diplays the DOD notice
    and consent banner when logging in using the OpenShift CLI tool (oc)

    > echo 'apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: motd
      namespace: openshift
    data:
