    Supporting evidence is in the following documentation

  status_justification: |-
    The OpenShift Container Platform provides RBAC policies and enforcement of those policies out of the box.  Verification of SRG-APP-000340-CTR-000770 will ensure that binding of user and groups to roles provides proper restriction of access to resources. For more information on how RBAC policies work in OpenShift.

    The internal OpenShift registry is protected by the platform's RBAC policies. Users requiring access to the registry must be granted the role registry-viewer or registry-editor to access the internal registry.
