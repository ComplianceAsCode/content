    The administrator must verify that Openshift is configured with the
    necessary RBAC access controls.

    Review the RBAC configuration by running the following commands:

    As the cluster-admin, view the cluster roles and their associated
    rule sets:

    > oc describe clusterrole.rbac

    Now view the current set of cluster role bindings, which shows the
    users and groups that are bound to various roles:

    >  oc describe clusterrolebinding.rbac

    Local roles and bindings can be determined using the follow commands:

    > oc describe rolebinding.rbac

    If these results show users with privileged access that do not require
    that access, this is a finding.
  fixtext: |-
    If users or groups exist that are bound to roles they should not have,
    modify the user or group permissions using the following cluster and
    local role binding commands:

    * Remove a User from a Cluster RBAC role

    > oc adm policy remove-cluster-role-from-user <role> <username>

    * Remove a Group from a Cluster RBAC role

    > oc adm policy remove-cluster-role-from-group <role> <groupname>

    * Remove a User from a Local RBAC role

    > oc adm policy remove-role-from-user <role> <username>

    * Remove a Group from a Local RBAC role

    > oc adm policy remove-role-from-group <role> <groupname>
