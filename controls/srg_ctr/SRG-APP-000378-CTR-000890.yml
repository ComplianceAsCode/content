  status_justification: |-
    User's of the OpenShift platform allows users with the appropriate
    roles and permissions to create images, or request existing images. OpenShift
    maintains and internal registry that is restricted from general users through RBAC
    policy.  Instead, user's with the appropriate permissions will manage images through
    the API. Most often this is done indirectly through image streams.  Refer to the
    following documentation for more details:
