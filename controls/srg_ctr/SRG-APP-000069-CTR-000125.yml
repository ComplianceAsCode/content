    From a web browser, go to the Openshift web console to login (logout
    if already logged in). Verify that the DOD notice and consent banner is
    displayed, and that the user must select 'Ok' before proceeding to the
    login page.

    If the DOD notice and consent banner is not displayed, or does not have an
    'Ok' button to acknowledge consent before proceeding, this is a finding.
