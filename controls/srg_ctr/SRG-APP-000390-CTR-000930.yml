  artifact_description: |-
    Supporting evidence is in the following documentation

    https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/using-rbac.html
  status_justification: |-
    The OpenShift Container Platform does not required a user/device to re-authenticate when changes to the RBAC policy, or permissions to a service/object change in the system.  These changes are applied and effective immediately and do not require the user/device to first logout.
