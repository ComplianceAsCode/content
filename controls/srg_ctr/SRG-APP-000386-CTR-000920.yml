  status_justification: |-
    The OpenShift Container Platform uses an extensive RBAC policy
    to determine if a user is allowed to perform a given action. The RBAC model defines
    a resource and a verb (or action) to be permitted. If an action is not explicitly
    allowed, it is denied by default.  See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/using-rbac.html
    for more information.
