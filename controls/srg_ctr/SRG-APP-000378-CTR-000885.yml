  title: {{{ full_name }}} runtime must prohibit the instantiation of container
    images without explicit privileged status.
  status: inherently met
  artifact_description: |-
    Supporting evidence is in the following documentation
    https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/using-rbac.html
  status_justification: |-
    User's of the OpenShift platform do not directly instantiate
    a container image. Instead in order to instantiate a container, the user creates
    a Deployment object with the details of the requested state.  OpenShift will then
    instantiate the containers inside pods on behalf of the users using a service
    account. OpenShift employs a robust RBAC policy to allow an administrator to control
    who has access to create, update, modify container deployments. Thus only user's
    with the appropriate permissions to a given namespace may create or modify deployment
    objects.
