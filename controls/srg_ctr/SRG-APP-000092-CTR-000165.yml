    Determine if cluster log forwarding is configured by performing the
    following commands.

    Verify that the cluster-logging operator is installed:

    > oc get subscription/cluster-logging -n openshift-logging 
    NAME            PACKAGE         SOURCE            CHANNEL 
    cluster-logging cluster-logging redhat-operators  stable

    If the cluster-logging operator is not present, this is a finding.

    List the cluster log forwarders defined:

    > oc get clusterlogforwarder -n openshift-logging

    If there are no clusterlogforwarders defined, this is a finding.

    For each cluster log forwarder listed above, view the configuration details:

    > oc describe clusterlogforwarder/<CLF_NAME> -n openshift-logging

    Review the details of the cluster log forwarder. If the configuration is
    not set to forward logs the organization's centralized logging service,
    this is a finding.
  fixtext: |-
    To resolve this, the OpenShift Cluster Logging operator first needs to
    be installed, then the Cluster Log Forwarder is configured to forward
    logs to a centralized log aggregation service.

    In order to install the OpenShift Cluter Logging operator, Run the
    following command to apply the subscription manifests to your cluster:

    > oc apply -f - << 'EOF' --- 
    apiVersion: project.openshift.io/v1 
    kind:Project 
    metadata:
      labels:
        kubernetes.io/metadata.name: openshift-logging
        openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: "true"
      name: openshift-logging
    spec: {} 
    ...  
    --- 
    apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1 
    kind: OperatorGroup
    metadata:

      namespace: openshift-logging
    spec:
      targetNamespaces: 
      - openshift-logging
    ...  
    --- 
    apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1 
    kind: Subscription
    metadata:
      labels:
        operators.coreos.com/cluster-logging.openshift-logging: ""

      source: redhat-operators 
      sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
    ...  
    EOF

    After the OpenShift Logging operator has finished installing, you can
    create a ClusterLogForwarder instance to forward cluster logs to a log
    aggregator. A basic configuration that would forward OpenShift audit,
    application, and infrastructure logs to an rsyslog server that you manage
    separately, and is configured for mTLS authentication over TCP when
    sending Audit logs but traditional UDP access for other types of logs,
    can be provided by editing the appropriate values in the Secret resource
    below and changing the "url" parameters in the "outputs" section of the
    "spec" below, then running the command to apply it like this: 

    oc apply -f - << 'EOF' 
    --- 
    apiVersion: v1 
    kind: Secret 
    metadata:
      name: rsyslog-tls-secret 
      namespace: openshift-logging
    data:
      tls.crt: <base64 encoded client certificate> 
      tls.key: <base64 encoded client key> 
      ca-bundle.crt: <base64 encoded CA bundle that signed the
      certificate of your rsyslog server>
    ...

    Please note that many log forwarding destinations are
    supported, and the fix does not require that you forward your
    audit logs to rsyslog over mTLS. To better understand how to
    configure the ClusterLogForwarder for your infrastructure and
    environment, please consult the OpenShift Logging documentation:
    https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/logging/cluster-logging-external.html
