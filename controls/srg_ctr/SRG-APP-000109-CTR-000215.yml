  status_justification: |-
    OpenShift's architecture is not structured to allow it to specifically
    halt on a failure to log.  The same database and API that power
    recording events are shared for normal access, so interactivity with the
    cluster would be lost in the event of a logging component failure, but
    workloads would continue operating.  This is by design, as the system
    is architected to attempt to recover from failure of components. In
    many failure modes, automated remediations would likely take place in
    the event of a logging failure.  The system will continue to operate
    during the remediation attempts.
  mitigation: |-
    The OpenShift Platform will generate an alert upon failure of the
    audit logging service. The responses to those alerts may be defined
    by the organizations administrative group, and may even be automated
    responses.  If there is a failure to forward logs to the organization's
    log collection service, OpenShift will retain about 10 logs up to
    100MB each, more than that, the logs will then rotate.
