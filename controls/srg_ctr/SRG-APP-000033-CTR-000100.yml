  title: Least privilege access and need to know must be required to access the container
    platform keystore.
  status: inherently met
  status_justification: |-
    The OpenShift Container Platform provides RBAC policies and
    enforcement of those policies out of the box.  Verification of
    SRG-APP-000340-CTR-000770 will ensure that binding of user and groups
    to roles provides proper restriction of access to resources. For more
    information on how RBAC policies work in OpenShift, refer to
    https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/using-rbac.html

    OpenShift Container Platform stores private keys and certs as Secret
    objects within the platform. Access to those objects is enforced by
    the platform's RBAC policies.
