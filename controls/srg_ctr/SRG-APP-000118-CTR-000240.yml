  status: does not meet
  status_justification: |-
    Fluentd stores logs that are to be forwarded to a centralized log collection service.
    The file permissions are too permissive,

    The /var/lib/fluentd permissions issue is tracked by https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2176
  mitigation: |-
    The logs themselves are protected by a combination of UNIX DAC permissions
    and SELinux labels.
    When OpenShift Cluster Logging Operator is used to forward logs off the
    cluster, then all the Cluster Logging Operator components are sandboxed
    (running inside the openshift-logging namespace and using a custom, locked down SCC).

    However, the SRG is marked as Does Not Meet, because data that is about to be
    forwarded off the OpenShift cluster are processed by fluentd in a MessagePack
    format and stored in a directory /var/log/fluentd whose permissions are too
    open and allow the MessagePacks to be read by any user.

    It should be noted though that in order to read those files, the user would
    either need to log in to the nodes or have access to a pod that mounts the host
    filesystem which is a privileged operation.
  fixtext: |-
    This requirement is a permanent finding and cannot be fixed.
  check: |-
    {{{ full_name }}} does not support this requirement.
    This is an applicable-does not meet finding.
