  notes: |-
    The authenticity and integrity of the container image during the container
    image lifecycle is part of the overall security posture of the container
    platform. This begins with the container image creation and pull of a base
    image from a trusted source for child container image creation and the
    instantiation of the new image into a running service. If an insecure
    protocol is used during transmission of container images at any step of the
    lifecycle, a bad actor may inject nefarious code into the container image.
    The container image, when instantiated, then becomes a security risk to the
    container platform, the host server, and other containers within the
    container platform. To thwart the injection of code during transmission, a
    secure protocol (TLS 1.2 or newer) must be used. Further guidance on secure
    transport protocols can be found in NIST SP 800-52.

    Supplemental Guidance:  The encryption strength of mechanism is selected
    based on the security categorization of the information. Related controls:
