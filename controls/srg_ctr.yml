    The authenticity and integrity of the container image during the container
    image lifecycle is part of the overall security posture of the container
    platform. This begins with the container image creation and pull of a base
    image from a trusted source for child container image creation and the
    instantiation of the new image into a running service. If an insecure
    protocol is used during transmission of container images at any step of the
    lifecycle, a bad actor may inject nefarious code into the container image.
    The container image, when instantiated, then becomes a security risk to the
    container platform, the host server, and other containers within the
    container platform. To thwart the injection of code during transmission, a
    secure protocol (TLS 1.2 or newer) must be used. Further guidance on secure
    transport protocols can be found in NIST SP 800-52.

    The information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to protect the
    confidentiality and integrity of remote access sessions.
    
    Supplemental Guidance:  The encryption strength of mechanism is selected
    based on the security categorization of the information. Related controls:
    SC-8, SC-12, SC-13.

    OpenShift supports several different types of identity providers.  In order
    to add users and grant access to OpenShift, an identity provider needs to be
    configured. Some of the identity provider types, such as HTPassword, only
    provide simple user management and are not intended for production. Other
    types are public services, like GitHub. These provider types may not be
    appropriate as they are managed by public service providers and therefore
    are unable to enforce the organizations account management requirements.
    
    Use either the LDAP or the OpenIDConnect Identity Provider type to configure
    OpenShift to use the organizations centrally managed IdP that is able to
    enforce the organization's policies in regard to user identity management.

    The organization employs automated mechanisms to support the management of
    information system accounts.
    
    Supplemental Guidance: The use of automated mechanisms can include, for
    example: using email or text messaging to automatically notify account
    managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information
    system to monitor account usage; and using telephonic notification to report
    atypical system account usage.
