    title: Planning the Separation of the Applications
    levels:
    - basic
    description: >-
      Before going live, the manner in which the applications running in the pods in question and
      their different test and production operating environments will be separated MUST be
      planned. Based on the protection needs of the applications, the planning MUST determine
      which architecture of namespaces, meta tags, clusters, and networks adequately addresses the
      risks at hand and whether virtualised servers and networks should also be used.
      The planning MUST include provisions separating for networks, CPUs, and persistent
      volumes. The separation SHOULD also take into account and be aligned with the network
      zone concept and the protection requirements at hand.
      Each application SHOULD run in a separate Kubernetes namespace that includes all the
      programs of the application. Only applications with similar protection needs and similar
      possible attack vectors SHOULD share a Kubernetes cluster.
    notes: >-
      These requirements must be implemented organizationally. OpenShift fully supports them.
      OpenShift simplifies the implementation of the stated requirements for separating applications
      as well as development and production environments by setting up projects (tenants).
      Namespaces, networks/network separation, meta tags as well as CPU and memory separation are already
      configured by OpenShift as required (security-by-design). Special requirements for protection and
      network zone concepts can also be flexibly and easily mapped using additional measures.
      This particularly includes the ability to define application classes, operate in multiple,
      separate clusters, and automatically distribute workloads to protection zones and fire compartments.
      Particularly in the case of separate clusters, ACM can support rule-based distribution of applications using labels.

    title: Planning Automation with CI/CD
    levels:

    description: >-
      (1) Automating the operation of applications in Kubernetes using CI/CD MUST ONLY take place
      after appropriate planning. (2) The planning MUST cover the entire lifecycle from commissioning
      to decommissioning, including development, testing, operation, monitoring, and updates. (3) A
      roles and rights concept and the securing of Kubernetes Secrets MUST be part of the planning
    notes: >-
      Since this requirement is a plan only, we cannot test this with compliance checks.
      Section 1: This requirement must be implemented organizationally.
      The documentation at https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/cicd/pipelines/understanding-openshift-pipelines.html
      provides information on the planning
      Section 2: The protective measure is primarily of an organizational nature. OpenShift fully supports them.
      With the integrated CI/CD technologies Jenkins, Tekton and OpenShift GitOps, OpenShift already offers preconfigured solutions
      for automated CI/CD pipelines. Of course, other technologies such as Gitlab CI and GitHub Actions can also be integrated.
      Section 3: Kubernetes secrets are secured by a Role Based Access Control (RBAC) system.
      Depending on the protection requirement, Kubernetes secrets can be secured via an (encrypted) etcd metadata store or
      additionally via an integration of Vault components or "sealed secrets" for CD and GitOps mechanisms.
      Secrets and roles can also be managed centrally using ACM and rolled out consistently to the managed clusters using policies.

      (1) Kubernetes and all other control plane applications MUST authenticate and authorise each
      action taken by a user or, in automated mode, corresponding software. This applies whether
      the actions are taken via a client, a web interface, or a corresponding API. Administrative
      actions MUST NOT be performed anonymously.
      (2) Each user MUST ONLY be granted the permissions they absolutely require. Unlimited access
      rights MUST be granted in a very restrictive manner.
      (3) Only a small group of people SHOULD be authorised to define automation processes. Only
      selected administrators SHOULD be given the right to create or change shares for persistent
      volumes in Kubernetes.
    notes: >-
      Section 1: In the default configuration, OpenShift restricts the use of the web console and APIs only to authenticated and authorized users.|
      Connection to external directory services (LDAP, OIDC and others) is possible.
      Section 2: OpenShift already offers roles for a least privilege concept. The RBAC roles can be adapted or supplemented with new roles.
      The preconfigured roles enable easy authorization assignment according to the least-privilege and need-to-know principles.
      User actions can be tracked via the audit log.
      Section 3: In the default configuration, persistent storage can only be integrated by cluster administrators.
      For dynamically provisioned storage, the corresponding provisioners have the necessary authorizations.
      These provisioners must be set up and configured by an admin. Storage requirements are controlled and restricted using quota mechanisms.

    notes: >-

      One of the key mechanisms in OCP4 to separate Workloads is SELinux. Thus this should be

      (2) Only the network ports of the pods necessary for operation SHOULD be released into the designated networks. (3) If a Kubernetes cluster contains multiple applications, all the network connections between the Kubernetes namespaces SHOULD first be prohibited and only required network connections permitted (whitelisting). (4) The network ports necessary for the administration of the nodes, the runtime, and Kubernetes (including its extensions) SHOULD ONLY be accessible from the corresponding administration network and from pods that need them.
      (5) Only selected administrators SHOULD be authorised in Kubernetes to manage the CNI and create or change rules for the network.
    notes: >-
      Section 1-3:
      The requirements for restricting network ports and network connections between Kubernetes namespaces are already supported by OpenShift as standard using network policies and the option for default network policies (security by design).

      The separation of the management network can also be implemented at the namespace level via network policies (incoming, the responsibility of the namespace administrator) and egress firewalls (outgoing, the responsibility of the cluster admins).

      Externally exposed services can receive their own IP and thus data traffic can also be separated outside the platform. Inter-node communication is carried out via suitable tunnel protocols (VXLAN, GENEVE) and can also be encrypted using IPSec.

      The determination of the necessary network policies for applications is supported by the network policy generator in ACS.
