    title: Planning the Separation of the Applications
    levels:
    - basic
    description: >-
      Before going live, the manner in which the applications running in the pods in question and
      their different test and production operating environments will be separated MUST be
      planned. Based on the protection needs of the applications, the planning MUST determine
      which architecture of namespaces, meta tags, clusters, and networks adequately addresses the
      risks at hand and whether virtualised servers and networks should also be used.
      The planning MUST include provisions separating for networks, CPUs, and persistent
      volumes. The separation SHOULD also take into account and be aligned with the network
      zone concept and the protection requirements at hand.
      Each application SHOULD run in a separate Kubernetes namespace that includes all the
      programs of the application. Only applications with similar protection needs and similar
      possible attack vectors SHOULD share a Kubernetes cluster.
    notes: >-
      These requirements must be implemented organizationally. OpenShift fully supports them.
      OpenShift simplifies the implementation of the stated requirements for separating applications
      as well as development and production environments by setting up projects (tenants).
      Namespaces, networks/network separation, meta tags as well as CPU and memory separation are already
      configured by OpenShift as required (security-by-design). Special requirements for protection and
      network zone concepts can also be flexibly and easily mapped using additional measures.
      This particularly includes the ability to define application classes, operate in multiple,
      separate clusters, and automatically distribute workloads to protection zones and fire compartments.
      Particularly in the case of separate clusters, ACM can support rule-based distribution of applications using labels.

    title: Planning Automation with CI/CD
    levels:
    - basic
    description: >-
      (1) Automating the operation of applications in Kubernetes using CI/CD MUST ONLY take place
      after appropriate planning. (2) The planning MUST cover the entire lifecycle from commissioning
      to decommissioning, including development, testing, operation, monitoring, and updates. (3) A
      roles and rights concept and the securing of Kubernetes Secrets MUST be part of the planning
    notes: >-
      Since this requirement is a plan only, we cannot test this with compliance checks.
      Section 1: This requirement must be implemented organizationally.
      The documentation at https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/cicd/pipelines/understanding-openshift-pipelines.html
      provides information on the planning
      Section 2: The protective measure is primarily of an organizational nature. OpenShift fully supports them.
      With the integrated CI/CD technologies Jenkins, Tekton and OpenShift GitOps, OpenShift already offers preconfigured solutions
      for automated CI/CD pipelines. Of course, other technologies such as Gitlab CI and GitHub Actions can also be integrated.
      Section 3: Kubernetes secrets are secured by a Role Based Access Control (RBAC) system.
      Depending on the protection requirement, Kubernetes secrets can be secured via an (encrypted) etcd metadata store or
      additionally via an integration of Vault components or "sealed secrets" for CD and GitOps mechanisms.
      Secrets and roles can also be managed centrally using ACM and rolled out consistently to the managed clusters using policies.

      the actions are taken via a client, a web interface, or a corresponding API. Administrative
      actions MUST NOT be performed anonymously.
      (2) Each user MUST ONLY be granted the permissions they absolutely require. Unlimited access
      rights MUST be granted in a very restrictive manner.
      (3) Only a small group of people SHOULD be authorised to define automation processes. Only
      selected administrators SHOULD be given the right to create or change shares for persistent
      volumes in Kubernetes.
    notes: >-
      Section 1: In the default configuration, OpenShift restricts the use of the web console and APIs only to authenticated and authorized users.|
      Connection to external directory services (LDAP, OIDC and others) is possible.
      Section 2: OpenShift already offers roles for a least privilege concept. The RBAC roles can be adapted or supplemented with new roles.
      The preconfigured roles enable easy authorization assignment according to the least-privilege and need-to-know principles.
      User actions can be tracked via the audit log.
      Section 3: In the default configuration, persistent storage can only be integrated by cluster administrators.
      For dynamically provisioned storage, the corresponding provisioners have the necessary authorizations.
      These provisioners must be set up and configured by an admin. Storage requirements are controlled and restricted using quota mechanisms.

    notes: >-

      One of the key mechanisms in OCP4 to separate Workloads is SELinux. Thus this should be
