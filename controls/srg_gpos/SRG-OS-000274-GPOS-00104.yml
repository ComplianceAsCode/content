        title: {{{ full_name }}} must notify system administrators and ISSOs when accounts
            are created.
        status: does not meet
        rationale: |-
            Once an attacker establishes access to a system, the attacker often attempts to create a persistent method of reestablishing access.
            One way to accomplish this is for the attacker to create a new account. Notification of account creation is one method for mitigating this risk.
            A comprehensive account management process will ensure an audit trail that documents the creation of operating system user accounts and notifies administrators and ISSOs that it exists.
            Such a process greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be surreptitiously created and provides logging that can be used for forensic purposes.
    
            To address access requirements, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level authentication/access/auditing mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements.
        check: |-
            {{{ full_name }}} does not support this requirement.
            This is an applicable-does not meet finding.
        fixtext: |-
            This requirement is a permanent finding and cannot be fixed.
            An appropriate mitigation for the system must be implemented, but this finding cannot be considered fixed.
        mitigation:
            Mitigate with third-party software.  

            Although the listed mitigation is supporting the security function, it is not sufficient to reduce the residual risk of this requirement.
        status_justification:
            Notification when accounts are created/modified/deleted must be provided by a third-party application that will communicate that an audit record of these actions has been created.
