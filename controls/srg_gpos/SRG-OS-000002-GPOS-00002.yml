          Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) is a single-purpose
          container operating system. RHCOS is only supported as a component
          of the OpenShift Container Platform. RHCOS is based on RHEL OS,
          but is designed to be managed more tightly, with controlled
          immutability, limiting the number of system settings that may
          be modified. Direct modification of the RHCOS configuration
          should not be done. Instead, management of RHCOS is therefore
          done using the OpenShift Container Platform's machine config
          management API and ignition configs as appropriate.

          For additional information about the RHCOS architecture see:
          https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/architecture/architecture-rhcos.html

          User account management is performed by the Identity Provider
          configured at the OpenShift Platform level. RHCOS includes
          a single user account (core) in addition to the root(0)
          account. Both accounts have no password, which prevents password
          based authentication. The core account is intended for debugging
          and troubleshooting purposes only. Automated account management
          of RHCOS is delegated to the platform level, without traditional
          Linux user logins on the RHCOS system. Checks to ensure that
          account management is not performed at the RHCOS level include
          (ref to SSHD_DISABLE) and (ref to SSSD_NO_AUTH_BACKEND).
