        title: {{{ full_name }}} must enforce dual authorization for movement and/or
            deletion of all audit information, when such movement or deletion is not part
            of an authorized automatic process.

            {{{ full_name }}} does not support this requirement.
            This is an applicable-does not meet finding.
        fixtext: |-
            This requirement is a permanent finding and cannot be fixed.
            An appropriate mitigation for the system must be implemented, but this finding cannot be considered fixed.
        mitigation:
            The following items mitigate this risk by protecting the audit logs and tools from unauthorized access.

            SRG-OS-000206-GPOS-00084
            or mitigate with third-party software.

            Although the listed mitigation is supporting the security function, it is not sufficient to reduce the residual risk of this requirement.
        status_justification:
            This is a procedural-only requirement that is not enforced by the OS.
