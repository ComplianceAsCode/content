        title: {{{ full_name }}} must allow operating system admins to change security
            attributes on users, the operating system, or the operating systems components.
        status: inherently met
        rationale: |-
            Administrators of {{{ full_name }}} need to be able change attributes on users, the operating system, 
            or {{{ full_name }}} components in order secure the system and ensure that the system is setup
            to perform the mission.
        check: |-
            {{{ full_name }}} supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance.
            {{{ full_name }}} inherently meets this requirement.
        fixtext: |-
            {{{ full_name }}} inherently meets this requirement.
            No fix is required.
        artifact_description:

            The root user has the abiliy to full administrator {{{ full_name }}}.
        status_justification:
          {{{ full_name }}} meets this requirement and it is not configurable.
