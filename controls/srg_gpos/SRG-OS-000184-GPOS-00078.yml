        title: {{{ full_name }}} must fail to a secure state if system initialization
            fails, shutdown fails, or aborts fail.
        status: inherently met
        rationale: |-
            Failure to a known safe state helps prevent systems from failing to a state that may cause loss of data or unauthorized access to system resources.
            Operating systems that fail suddenly and with no incorporated failure state planning may leave the system available but with a reduced security protection capability.
            Preserving operating system state information also facilitates system restart and return to the operational mode of the organization with less disruption to mission-essential processes.

            Abort refers to stopping a program or function before it has finished naturally.
            The term abort refers to both requested and unexpected terminations.
        check: |-
            {{{ full_name }}} supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance.
            {{{ full_name }}} inherently meets this requirement.
        fixtext:
            {{{ full_name }}} inherently meets this requirement.
            No fix is required.
        status_justification:
            {{{ full_name }}} is secure in the event of a failure.
            Authentication and authorizations are still necessary to access the system.
