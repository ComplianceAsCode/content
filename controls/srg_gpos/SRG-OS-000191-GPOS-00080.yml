        title: |-
            {{{ full_name }}} must employ automated mechanisms to determine the state of system
            components with regard to flaw remediation using the following frequency:
            continuously, 30 days, and annually, for external scans by Computer Network
            Defense Service Provider (CNDSP).

        rationale: |-
            Without the use of automated mechanisms to scan for security flaws on a continuous and/or periodic basis, the operating system or other system components may remain vulnerable to the exploits presented by undetected software flaws.

            To support this requirement, the operating system may have an integrated solution incorporating continuous scanning using ESS and periodic scanning using other tools, as specified in the requirement.
        status_justification:
            {{{ full_name }}} does not have configuration options to meet this requirement.
        check: |-
            {{{ full_name }}} does not support this requirement.
            This is an applicable-does not meet finding.
        fixtext:
            This requirement is a permanent finding and cannot be fixed.
            An appropriate mitigation for the system must be implemented, but this finding cannot be considered fixed.
        mitigation:
            A third-party software will be needed to meet this requirement e.g. McAfee policy auditor.

            Although the listed mitigation is supporting the security function, it is not sufficient to reduce the residual risk of this requirement.
