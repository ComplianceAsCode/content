        title: '{{{ full_name }}} must employ automated mechanisms to determine the state
                of system components with regard to flaw remediation using the following frequency:
                continuously, where ESS is used; 30 days, for any additional internal network
                scans not cover'
        status: does not meet
        rationale: |-
            Without the use of automated mechanisms to scan for security flaws on a continuous and/or periodic basis, the operating system or other system components may remain vulnerable to the exploits presented by undetected software flaws.
        
            To support this requirement, the operating system may gihave an integrated solution incorporating continuous scanning using ESS and periodic scanning using other tools, as specified in the requirement.
        status_justification:
            {{{ full_name }}} does not have configuration options to meet this requirement.
        check: |-
            {{{ full_name }}} does not support this requirement.
            This is an applicable-does not meet finding.
        fixtext:
            This requirement is a permanent finding and cannot be fixed.
            An appropriate mitigation for the system must be implemented, but this finding cannot be considered fixed.
        mitigation:
            A third-party software will be needed to meet this requirement e.g. McAfee policy auditor.
        
            Although the listed mitigation is supporting the security function, it is not sufficient to reduce the residual risk of this requirement.
