        title: {{{ full_name }}} must enforce access restrictions.
        status: inherently met
        rationale: |-
            Failure to provide logical access restrictions associated with changes to system configuration may have significant effects on the overall security of the system.

            When dealing with access restrictions pertaining to change control, it should be noted that any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of the operating system can have significant effects on the overall security of the system.

            Accordingly, only qualified and authorized individuals should be allowed to obtain access to operating system components for the purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.

            Logical access restrictions include, for example, controls that restrict access to workflow automation, media libraries, abstract layers (e.g., changes implemented into third-party interfaces rather than directly into information systems), and change windows (e.g., changes occur only during specified times, making unauthorized changes easy to discover).
        check: |-
            {{{ full_name }}} supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance.
            {{{ full_name }}} inherently meets this requirement.

            {{{ full_name }}} inherently meets this requirement.
            No fix is required.
        status_justification: |-
          {{{ full_name }}} is based on the Linux kernel. The Linux kernel enforces access restrictions as detailed here: https://www.linux.com/tutorials/overview-linux-kernel-security-features/.

        artifact_description: |-
            The UNIX permissions construct separates user and privileged user (the operating system accounts) access.
