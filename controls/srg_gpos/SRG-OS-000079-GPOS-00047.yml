        title:  {{{ full_name }}} must obscure feedback of authentication information
            during the authentication process to protect the information from possible exploitation/use
            by unauthorized individuals.
        description: {{{ full_name }}} must obscure feedback of authentication information during the authentication process to protect the information from possible exploitation/use by unauthorized individuals.
        rationale: |-
            To prevent the compromise of authentication information, such as passwords during the authentication process, the feedback from {{{ full_name }}} must not provide any information allowing an unauthorized user to compromise the authentication mechanism.

            Obfuscation of user-provided information that is typed into the system is a method used when addressing this risk.

            For example, displaying asterisks when a user types in a password is an example of obscuring feedback of authentication information.
        check: |-
            {{{ full_name }}} supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance.
            {{{ full_name }}} inherently meets this requirement.
        fixtext: The technology inherently meets this requirement. No fix is required.
        mitigation: |-
            The "passwd", "login", and "sudo" do not display the passwords being typed.

            The "passwd.c" from the "passwd" source code uses the "getpass" function, which is specific for retrieving passwords, thus does not provide a feedback to the terminal.

            The "tgetpass.c" from the sudo source code uses "tgetpass" function, which has a similar behavior to "getpass", including not providing a terminal feedback for passwords.

            The login uses pam_authenticate, which similarly does not provide a terminal feedback during password authentication.
        status_justification: The "passwd", "login", and "sudo" commands on the system does not print any characters that are entered as a password.
        status: inherently met
