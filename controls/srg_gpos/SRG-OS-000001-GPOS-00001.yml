        title: {{{ full_name }}} must provide automated mechanisms for supporting account
            management functions.
        description: |-
            {{{ full_name }}} must provide automated mechanisms for supporting account management functions.
        rationale: |-
            Enterprise environments make account management challenging and complex.
            A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential oversight or other errors.

            A comprehensive account management process that includes automation helps to ensure accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed.
            Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended, or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores such as multiple servers.
            This requirement applies to all account types, including individual/user, shared, group, system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and service.

            The automated mechanisms may reside within the operating system itself or may be offered by another infrastructure providing automated account management capabilities.
            Automated mechanisms may be composed of differing technologies that, when placed together, contain an overall automated mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements.

            Account management functions include: assigning group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. 
            The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to automatically notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephonic notification to report atypical system account usage.
        status_justification: |-
            Mitigate with third-party software.

            As noted in the vulnerability discussion, "The automated mechanisms may reside within the operating system itself or may be offered by another infrastructure providing automated account management capabilities.
            Automated mechanisms may be composed of differing technologies that, when placed together, contain an overall automated mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements.
            This is not required to be provided by {{{ full_name }}} and must be implemented via a third party solution.
        mitigation: |-
            Mitigate with third-party software.

            Although the listed mitigation is supporting the security function, it is not sufficient to reduce the residual risk of this requirement.
        fixtext: |-
            This requirement is a permanent finding and cannot be fixed.
            An appropriate mitigation for the system must be implemented, but this finding cannot be considered fixed.
        check: |-
            {{{ full_name }}} does not support this requirement.
            This is an applicable-does not meet finding.
        status: does not meet

          Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) is a single-purpose
          container operating system. RHCOS is only supported as a component
          of the OpenShift Container Platform. RHCOS is based on RHEL OS,
          but is designed to be managed more tightly, with controlled
          immutability, limiting the number of system settings that may
          be modified. Direct modification of the RHCOS configuration
          should not be done. Instead, management of RHCOS is therefore
          done using the OpenShift Container Platform's machine config
          management API and ignition configs as appropriate.

          For additional information about the RHCOS architecture see:
          https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/architecture/architecture-rhcos.html

          User account management is performed by the Identity Provider
          configured at the OpenShift Platform level. RHCOS includes
          a single user account (core) in addition to the root(0)
          account. Both accounts have no password, which prevents password
          based authentication. The core account is intended for debugging
          and troubleshooting purposes only. Automated account management
          of RHCOS is delegated to the platform level, without traditional
          Linux user logins on the RHCOS system. Checks to ensure that
          account management is not performed at the RHCOS level include
          (ref to SSHD_DISABLE) and (ref to SSSD_NO_AUTH_BACKEND).
