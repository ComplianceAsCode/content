        title: {{{ full_name }}} must require devices to re-authenticate when changing
            authenticators.
        status: not applicable
        rationale: |-
            Without re-authentication, devices may access resources or perform tasks for which they do not have authorization.

        check:
            This requirement is NA for {{{ full_name }}}.
        fixtext:
            The requirement is NA.
            No fix is required.
        status_justification:
            Devices are not assigned authenticators in {{{ full_name }}}.
