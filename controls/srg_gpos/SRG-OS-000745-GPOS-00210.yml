controls:
    -   id: SRG-OS-000745-GPOS-00210
        title: '{{{ full_name }}} must accept only external credentials that are NIST-compliant.'
        levels:
            - medium
        status: does not meet
        rationale: |-
            Allowing only NIST-compliant external authenticators ensures that the system meets or exceeds federal requirements, enabling federal government relying parties to trust these authenticators during authentication transactions at a specified authenticator assurance level.
        mitigation: |-
            Ensure system level controls are in place to implement comprehensive authenticator and identifier alignment to correlating system requirements.

            Although the listed mitigation is supporting the security function, it is not sufficient to reduce the residual risk of this requirement.
        status_justification: |-
            {{{ full_name }}} does not natively provide mechanisms which satisfy all requirements identified in NIST SP 800-63b.
