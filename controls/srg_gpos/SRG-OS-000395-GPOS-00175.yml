        title: '{{{ full_name }}} must verify remote disconnection at the termination of
    nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions, when used for nonlocal maintenance
    sessions.'
        check:
          {{{ full_name }}} supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance.
          {{{ full_name }}} inherently meets this requirement.
        fixtext:
            {{{ full_name }}} inherently meets this requirement. No fix is required.
        artifact_description:
            When a process terminates, Linux kernel executes the kernel/exit.c:do_exit() function which indirectly calls fs/file.c:close_files().
            The latter iterates over all file descriptors of the process and close them.
            Since a socket also receives a file descriptor, the kernel close those, as well.
        status_justification:
            The use of the "exit" command will end any communication session on the system.
            This is part of the kernel and cannot be removed without recompiling.
        status: inherently met
