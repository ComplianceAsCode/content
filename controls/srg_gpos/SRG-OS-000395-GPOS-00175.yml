        title: {{{ full_name }}} must verify remote disconnection at the termination of
            nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions, when used for nonlocal maintenance sessions.
            If the remote connection is not closed and verified as closed, the session may remain open and be exploited by an attacker; this is referred to as a zombie session.
            Remote connections must be disconnected and verified as disconnected when nonlocal maintenance sessions have been terminated and are no longer available for use.
        check:
          {{{ full_name }}} supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance.
          {{{ full_name }}} inherently meets this requirement.
        fixtext:
            {{{ full_name }}} inherently meets this requirement. No fix is required.
        artifact_description:
            When a process terminates, Linux kernel executes the kernel/exit.c:do_exit() function which indirectly calls fs/file.c:close_files().
            The latter iterates over all file descriptors of the process and close them.
            Since a socket also receives a file descriptor, the kernel close those, as well.
        status_justification:
            The use of the "exit" command will end any communication session on the system.
            This is part of the kernel and cannot be removed without recompiling.
        status: inherently met
