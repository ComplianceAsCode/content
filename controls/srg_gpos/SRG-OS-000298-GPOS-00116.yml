        title: {{{ full_name }}} must provide the capability to immediately disconnect
            or disable remote access to the operating system.
        status: inherently met
        rationale: |-
            Without the ability to immediately disconnect or disable remote access, an attack or other compromise taking place would not be immediately stopped.

            {{{ full_name }}} remote access functionality must have the capability to immediately disconnect current users remotely accessing the information system and/or disable further remote access.
            The speed of disconnect or disablement varies based on the criticality of missions functions and the need to eliminate immediate or future remote access to organizational information systems.

            The remote access functionality (e.g., RDP) may implement features such as automatic disconnect (or user-initiated disconnect) in case of adverse information based on an indicator of compromise or attack.
        check: |-
            {{{ full_name }}} supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance.
            {{{ full_name }}} inherently meets this requirement.
        fixtext: |-
            {{{ full_name }}} inherently meets this requirement.
            No fix is required.
        artifact_description: |-
            The admin can shutdown networking to the host by port, NIC, or the entire network as desired.
        status_justification: |-
            The use of the "exit" command will end any communication session on the system. This is part of the kernel and cannot be removed without recompiling.

            The admin can shutdown networking to the host by port, NIC, or the entire network as desired.
