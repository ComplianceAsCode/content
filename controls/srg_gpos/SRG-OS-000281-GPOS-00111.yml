        title: {{{ full_name }}} must display an explicit logoff message to users indicating
            the reliable termination of authenticated communications sessions.
        status: inherently met
        rationale: |-
            If a user cannot explicitly end an operating system session, the session may remain open and be exploited by an attacker; this is referred to as a zombie session.
            Users need to be aware of whether or not the session has been terminated.

            Information resources to which users gain access via authentication includes for example, local workstations and remote services.
            Logoff messages can be displayed after authenticated sessions have been terminated. 
            However, for some types of interactive sessions, including, for example, remote logon, and information systems typically send logoff messages as final messages prior to terminating sessions.
        check:
            {{{ full_name }}} supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance.
            {{{ full_name }}} inherently meets this requirement.
        fixtext: |-
            {{{ full_name }}} inherently meets this requirement.
            No fix is required.
        artifact_description:
            When logging off from a SSH terminal session, SSH prints "Connection to <host> closed".
            This is hard coded in client_loop() in clientloop.c, https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/master/clientloop.c
            When the remote ends the connection, a message is also printed. "Connection to <host> closed by remote host". 
            This message is hard-code in client_process_net_input() in clientloop.c
        status_justification:
          {{{ full_name }}} meets this requirement and it is not configurable.
