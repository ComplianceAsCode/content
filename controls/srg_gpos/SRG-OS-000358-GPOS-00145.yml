        title: {{{ full_name }}} must record time stamps for audit records that meet
            a minimum granularity of one second for a minimum degree of precision.
        status: inherently met
        rationale: |-
            Without sufficient granularity of time stamps, it is not possible to adequately determine the chronological order of records.

            Time stamps generated by the operating system include date and time.
            Granularity of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between information system clocks and reference clocks.
        check: |-
          {{{ full_name }}} supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance.
          {{{ full_name }}} inherently meets this requirement.
        fixtext: |-
             {{{ full_name }}} inherently meets this requirement.
             No fix is required.
        artifact_description: |-
            Linux kernel audit subsystem always adds a timestamp to each audit buffer used to contain the entire audit log data.
            Function kernel/audit.c:audit_log_start() calls kernel/audit.c:audit_get_stamp() to fetch the timestamp and formats the message into the audit log buffer.
        status_justification: |-
            The {{{ full_name }}} clock is part of the Linux kernel and is driven by a timer interrupt.
            The "ntp_adjtime" only allows for two modes of operation: "ntp_adjtime" or "adj_nano".
