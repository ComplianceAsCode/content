    title: {{{ full_name }}} must allow the use of a temporary password for system
             logons with an immediate change to a permanent password.
    status: inherently met
    rationale: |-
      Without providing this capability, an account may be created without a password.
      Non-repudiation cannot be guaranteed once an account is created if a user is not forced to change the temporary password upon initial logon.
      
      Temporary passwords are typically used to allow access when new accounts are created or passwords are changed.
      It is common practice for administrators to create temporary passwords for user accounts that allow the users to log on, yet force them to change the password once they have successfully authenticated.
    check: |-
      {{{ full_name }}} supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance.
      {{{ full_name }}} inherently meets this requirement.
    fixtext: |-
      {{{ full_name }}} inherently meets this requirement.
      No fix is required.
    artifact_description: |-
      {{{ full_name }}} offers the following commands to facilitate the use of a temporary password.
      
      chage -d 0 [username]
      (forces the user to change their password at next logon)
    
      passwd -e [username]
      (expires the passwd for a given user forcing a change at next logon.)
    status_justification: |-
      {{{ full_name }}} has the capability to perform temporary passwords based on organization policy.
      Configuration is not appropriate to define at an enterprise level.
