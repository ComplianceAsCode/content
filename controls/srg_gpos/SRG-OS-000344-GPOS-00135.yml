        title: {{{ full_name }}} must provide an immediate real-time alert to the SA
            and ISSO, at a minimum, of all audit failure events requiring real-time alerts.
        status: does not meet
        description: |-
            {{{ full_name }}} must provide an immediate real-time alert to the SA and ISSO, at a minimum, of all audit failure events requiring real-time alerts.
        rationale: |-
            It is critical for the appropriate personnel to be aware if a system is at risk of failing to process audit logs as required.
            Without a real-time alert, security personnel may be unaware of an impending failure of the audit capability and system operation may be adversely affected.

            Alerts provide organizations with urgent messages.
            Real-time alerts provide these messages immediately (i.e., the time from event detection to alert occurs in seconds or less).
        check: |-
            {{{ full_name }}} does not support this requirement.
            This is an applicable-does not meet finding.
        fixtext:
            This requirement is a permanent finding and cannot be fixed.
            An appropriate mitigation for the system must be implemented, but this finding cannot be considered fixed.
        mitigation:
            Mitigate with third-party software.

            Although the listed mitigation is supporting the security function, it is not sufficient to reduce the residual risk of this requirement.
        status_justification:
            Notification when accounts are created/modified/deleted must be provided by a third party application that will communicate that an audit record of these actions has been created.
