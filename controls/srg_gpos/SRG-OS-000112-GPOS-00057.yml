        title: {{{ full_name }}} must implement replay-resistant authentication mechanisms
            for network access to privileged accounts.
        status: inherently met
        rationale: |-
            A replay attack may enable an unauthorized user to gain access to {{{ full_name }}}. Authentication sessions between the authenticator and {{{ full_name }}} validating the user credentials must not be vulnerable to a replay attack.

            An authentication process resists replay attacks if it is impractical to achieve a successful authentication by recording and replaying a previous authentication message.

            A privileged account is any information system account with authorizations of a privileged user.

            Techniques used to address this include protocols using nonces (e.g., numbers generated for a specific one-time use) or challenges (e.g., TLS, WS_Security). Additional techniques include time-synchronous or challenge-response one-time authenticators.
        check: |-
            {{{ full_name }}} supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance.
            {{{ full_name }}} inherently meets this requirement.
        fixtext: |-
            {{{ full_name }}} inherently meets this requirement.
            No fix is required.
        artifact_description: |-
            The release notes of OpenSSH 7.6 states "OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and includes sftp client and server support."
            https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-7.6
        status_justification:
            The OpenSSH package in {{{ full_name }}} is version 9.6, which is newer than 7.6 which only supports SSH protocol 2.0 which is restraint to replay attacks.
