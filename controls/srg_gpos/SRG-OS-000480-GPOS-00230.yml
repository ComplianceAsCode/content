        title: '{{{ full_name }}} must limit the ability of non-privileged users to grant
            other users direct access to the contents of their home directories/folders.'
        status: does not meet
        rationale: |-
            Users home directories/folders may contain information of a sensitive nature.
            Non-privileged users should coordinate any sharing of information with an SA
            through shared resources.
        fixtext: |-
            This requirement is a permanent finding and cannot be fixed.
            An appropriate mitigation for the system must be implemented, but this finding cannot be considered fixed.
        mitigation: |-
            Ensure discretionary access control policies are implemented at the system level to enforce
               restrictions preventing non-privileged user from granting other users access to their home directories.

            Although the listed mitigation is supporting the security function, it is not sufficient to reduce the residual risk of this requirement.
        status_justification: |-
            {{{ full_name }}} does not natively support a method of limiting the ability of non-privileged users to grant
             other users direct access to the contents of their home directories/folders.
