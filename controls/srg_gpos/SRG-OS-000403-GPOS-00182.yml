        title:  {{{ full_name }}} must only allow the use of DoD PKI-established certificate
            authorities for authentication in the establishment of protected sessions to
            {{{ full_name }}}.
        status: does not meet
        description:
            {{{ full_name }}} must only allow the use of DoD PKI-established certificate authorities for authentication in the establishment of protected sessions to the operating system.
        rationale:
            Untrusted Certificate Authorities (CA) can issue certificates, but they may be issued by organizations or individuals that seek to compromise DoD systems or by organizations with insufficient security controls.
            If the CA used for verifying the certificate is not a DoD-approved CA, trust of this CA has not been established.

            The DoD will only accept PKI-certificates obtained from a DoD-approved internal or external certificate authority.
            Reliance on CAs for the establishment of secure sessions includes, for example, the use of SSL/TLS certificates.
        check:
            {{{ full_name }}} does not support this requirement.
            This is an applicable-does not meet finding.
        fixtext:
            This requirement is a permanent finding and cannot be fixed.
            An appropriate mitigation for the system must be implemented, but this finding cannot be considered fixed.
        mitigation:
            This item can be mitigated by installing an additional packages/software that is not included in the default install of {{{ full_name }}}.

            Although the listed mitigation is supporting the security function, it is not sufficient to reduce the residual risk of this requirement.
        status_justification:
            This is a procedural-only requirement that is not enforced by the OS.
