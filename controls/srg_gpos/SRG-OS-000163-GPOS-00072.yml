        title: '{{{ full_name }}} must terminate all network connections associated with
            a communications session at the end of the session, or as follows: for in-band
            management sessions (privileged sessions), the session must be terminated after
            10 minutes of inactivity; and for user sessions (non-privileged session), the
            session must be terminated after 15 minutes of inactivity, except to fulfill
            documented and validated mission requirements.'

        status_justification: |-
            {{{ full_name }}} does not have configuration options to
            meet this requirement. There is no option to configure sshd timeout
            interval. {{{ full_name }}} ships OpenSSH newer than
            version 8.2. The sshd_config options ClientAliveInterval and
            ClientAliveCountMax don't work on versions newer than v8.2 as they
            used to work before this release.  For SSH earlier than v8.2, a
            ClientAliveCountMax value of 0 causes an idle timeout precisely
            when the ClientAliveInterval is set.  Starting with v8.2, a value
            of 0 disables the timeout functionality completely. If the option
            is set to a number greater than 0, then the idle session will be
            disconnected after ClientAliveInterval * ClientAliveCountMax
            seconds.
