    description: >-
      Before containers are deployed, the goal of such a deployment (e.g. scaling, availability,
      disposable containers for safety or CI/CD) SHOULD be determined so that all the security-
      related aspects of installation, operation, and decommissioning can be planned. The planning
      SHOULD also take into account the operational overhead resulting from container
      deployment or mixed operation. The planning MUST be adequately documented

      The management of containers MUST ONLY be carried out in line with appropriate planning.
      This planning MUST cover the entire lifecycle from commissioning to decommissioning,
      including operation and updates. When planning container management, it MUST be taken
      into account that the creator of a container is to be considered like an administrator due to the
      effects they have on parts of the operation.
      Containers MUST be started, stopped, and monitored via the management software used.

    levels:

    description: >-
      In the case of containerised IT systems, consideration MUST be given to how containerisation
      affects the IT systems and applications operated, in particular the management and suitability
      of the applications.
      Based on the protection needs of the applications, it MUST be checked whether the
      requirements for isolation and encapsulation of the containerised IT systems, virtual
      networks, and operated applications are sufficiently fulfilled. The mechanisms of the
      operating system in question SHOULD be included in this check. Since the host performs the
      function of a network component for virtual networks, the modules of the sub-layers NET.1
      Networks and NET.3 Network Components MUST be considered accordingly. Logical and
      overlay networks MUST also be considered and modelled. Furthermore, the containerised IT
      systems used MUST meet the requirements at hand regarding availability and data
      throughput.
      During operation, the performance and the state of the containerised IT systems SHOULD be
      monitored (health checks).

      corresponding guarantees to customers.
      The utilised version of base images MUST NOT be deprecated. Unique version numbers MUST
      be provided. If an image with a newer version number is available, a patch and change
      management process MUST check whether and how it can be rolled out
