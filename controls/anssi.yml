    description: >-

      be installed.
      Those whose presence can not be justified should be disabled, removed or deleted.
    status: partial  # The list of essential services is not objective.
    notes: >-
      Performing a minimal install is a good starting point, but doesn't provide any assurance
      over any package installed later.
      Manual review is required to assess if the installed services are minimal.
      In general, use of obsolete or insecure services is not recommended and we remove some
      of these in this recommendation.

      Defense in-depth can be broadly divided into three areas - physical, technical and
      administrative. The security profile is best suited to protect the technical area.
      Among the barriers that can be implemented within the technical area are antivirus software,
      authentication, multi-factor authentication, encryption, logging, auditing, sandboxing,
      intrusion detection systems, firewalls and vulnerability scanners.

    description: >-
      Remote user sessions (shell access, graphical clients) must be closed

    notes: >-
      There is no specific capability to check remote user inactivity, but some shells allow the
      session inactivity time out to be configured via TMOUT variable.
      In OpenSSH < 8.2 the inactivity of the user is implied from the network inactivity.
      The server is configured to disconnect sessions if no data has been received within the idle timeout,
      regardless of liveness status (ClientAliveCountMax is 0 and ClientAliveInterval is > 0).
      In OpenSSH >= 8.2 there is no way to disconnect sessions based on client liveness.
      The semantics of "ClientAliveCountMax 0" has changed from "disconnect on first timeout" to
      "don't disconnect network inactive sessions". The server either probes for the client liveness
      or keeps inactive sessions connected.
