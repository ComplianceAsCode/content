      This requirement can be checked, but remediation requires manual reinstall of the OS.
      The content automation cannot really configure the BIOS, but can in some cases,
      check settings that are visible to the OS. Like for example the NX/DX setting.

    notes: >-
      There is no specific capability to check remote user inactivity, but some shells allow the
      session inactivity time out to be configured via TMOUT variable.
      In OpenSSH < 8.2 the inactivity of the user is implied from the network inactivity.
      The server is configured to disconnect sessions if no data has been received within the idle timeout,
      regardless of liveness status (ClientAliveCountMax is 0 and ClientAliveInterval is > 0).
      In OpenSSH >= 8.2 there is no way to disconnect sessions based on client liveness.
      The semantics of "ClientAliveCountMax 0" has changed from "disconnect on first timeout" to
      "don't disconnect network inactive sessions". The server either probes for the client liveness
      or keeps inactive sessions connected.
