      Use of obsolete or insecure services is not recommended.
      The minimal install is a good starting point, but this doesn't provide any assurance over any package installed later.

      Defense in-depth can be broadly divided into three areas - physical, technical and
      administrative. The security profile is best suitedto protect the technical area.
      Among the barriers that can be implemented within the technical area are antivirus software,
      authentication, multi-factor authentication, encryption, logging, auditing, sandboxing,
      intrusion detection systems, firewalls and vulnerability scanners.

      There is no specific capability to check remote user inactivity, but some shells allow the

      In OpenSSH < 8.2 the inactivity of the user is implied from the network inactivity.
      The server is configured to disconnect sessions if no data has been received within the idle timeout,
      regardless of liveness status (ClientAliveCountMax is 0 and ClientAliveInterval is > 0).
      In OpenSSH >= 8.2 there is no way to disconnect sessions based on client liveness.
      The semantics of "ClientAliveCountMax 0" has changed from "disconnect on first timeout" to
      "don't disconnect network inactive sessions". The server either probes for the client liveness
      or keeps inactive sessions connected.

    description: >-
      The system umask must be set to 0027 (by default, any created file can
      only be read by the user and his group, and be editable only by his owner).
      The umask for users must be set to 0077 (any file created by a user is
      readable and editable only by him).
    notes: >-
      There is no simple way to check and remediate different umask values for
      system and standard users reliably.
      The different values are set in a conditional clause in a shell script
      (e.g. /etc/profile or /etc/bashrc).
      The current implementation checks and fixes both umask to the same value.

      recognized and authorized repositories (covered in R15).
      The remediation resets the sticky bit to intended value by vendor/developer, any finding after remediation
      should be reviewed.
