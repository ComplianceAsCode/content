      This requirement can be checked, but remediation requires manual reinstall of the OS.
      The content automation cannot really configure the BIOS, but can in some cases,
      check settings that are visible to the OS. Like for example the NX/DX setting.

    description: >-
      It is recommended to apply UEFI Secure Boot configuration of the distribution.
    notes: >-
      Secure Boot needs to be enabled in the UEFI Setup program.
      Enabling Secure Boot can't be accomplished from the operating system.
      Also, OVAL doesn't provide any reliable ways to detect the Secure Boot status.
      Therefore, we will not provide any rules to automate this requirement.
      We recommend checking the Secure Boot status using the `mokutil --sb-state` or `bootctl status` commands.

    description: >-
      It is recommended to replace the UEFI preloaded keys with new keys used to sign;
      the bootloader and Linux kernel, or; the image of the Linux kernel in EFI format.
    notes: >-
      This requirement is not generally automatable. The Machine Owner Key (MOK) could
      be used to add keys to the Secure Boot db key database but manual interaction is
      required to navigate the UEFI console and input the key password.
      On systems where MOK utility is not supported, one will need to access the UEFI
      firmware interface to add new keys.
      We have no automation support for UEFI interfaces and the steps for each hardware
      manufacturer can vary.

    title: Protecting kernel command line parameters
    levels:

    description: >-
      It is recommended that UEFI Secure Boot is used to protect the Linux Kernel
      command line parameters during boot.
    notes: >-
      To protect the Linux Kernel command line one needs to create an Unified Kernel Image and use
      it with the UEFI Secure Boot mechanism.
      To check if the Kernel image contains the kernel command one needs to inspect the binary, on
      the command line one can use the objdump command. But unfortunately OVAL is not able to
      inspect kernel images.
      Also, it is not trivial to automate creation of such image or configuration of the
      Secure Boot mechanism.

      The default value of UMASK for services must be determined for each service, but in most

      There are cases of Systemd services which would stop working in case umask
