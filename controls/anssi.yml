      Defense in-depth can be broadly divded into three areas, physical, technical and
      administrative. The security profile is best suitedto protect the technical area.
      Among the barriers that can be implemented within the technical area are antivirus software,
      authentication, multi-factor authentication, encryption, logging, auditing, sandboxing,
      intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and vulnerability scanners.
