          It is recommended to apply UEFI Secure Boot configuration of the distribution.
      notes: >-
          Secure Boot needs to be enabled in the UEFI Setup program.
          Enabling Secure Boot can't be accomplished from the operating system.
          Also, OVAL doesn't provide any reliable ways to detect the Secure Boot status.
          Therefore, we will not provide any rules to automate this requirement.
          We recommend checking the Secure Boot status using the `mokutil --sb-state` or `bootctl status`
          commands.

          It is recommended to replace the UEFI preloaded keys with new keys used to sign;
          the bootloader and Linux kernel, or; the image of the Linux kernel in EFI format.
      notes: >-
          This requirement is not generally automatable. The Machine Owner Key (MOK) could
          be used to add keys to the Secure Boot db key database but manual interaction is
          required to navigate the UEFI console and input the key password.
          On systems where MOK utility is not supported, one will need to access the UEFI
          firmware interface to add new keys.
          We have no automation support for UEFI interfaces and the steps for each hardware
          manufacturer can vary.

          It is recommended that UEFI Secure Boot is used to protect the Linux Kernel
          command line parameters during boot.
      notes: >-
          To protect the Linux Kernel command line one needs to create an Unified Kernel Image and use
          it with the UEFI Secure Boot mechanism.
          To check if the Kernel image contains the kernel command one needs to inspect the binary, on
          the command line one can use the objdump command. But unfortunately OVAL is not able to
          inspect kernel images.
          Also, it is not trivial to automate creation of such image or configuration of the
          Secure Boot mechanism.

          example updating the kernel. Therefore, for better stability, in this requirement only rules
          to restrict the access to /boot are selected. It is not changed how the /boot is mounted.

          whose owners don't use the system anymore, or users created by services
          or applications that should not be used.

      description: >-
          The default value of UMASK for the shells must be set to 0077 in order to allow read and
          write access to its owner only. This value can be defined in the configuration file
          /etc/profile that most shells (bash, dash, ksh…) will use.
          The default value of UMASK for services must be determined for each service, but in most
          cases, it should be set to 0027 (or more restrictive). This allows read access to its owner
          and its group, and a full access to its owner. For services such as systemd, this value can
          be defined directly in the configuration file of the service with the directive UMask=0027.
      notes: >-
          There are cases of Systemd services which would stop working in case umask
          would be configured to 0027 for all services. One such example is the
          Cups service which needs to create sockets which need to be available for
          all users. Therefore, this part of the requirement can't be automated.

          The requirement states that all sockets and named pipes within all mounted

          of the socket / pipe and compare them with permissions of the directory
          which contains the particular socket. In case permissions of the directory
          are less stricter than permissions of the socket, this should be
          considered a finding. Since different use cases can require different
          permissions for named pipes / sockets, it is not possible to perform this
          check automatically.

          One approach to check the origin of installed packages is to check the signature of the packages.
