# In BSI Basic Protection there are multiple Requirements in one control.
# i.e. there are multiple sentences, some including a RFC2119 keyword
# Since we must increase granularity to create a precise control,
# we number each sentence with a RFC2119 keyword as a section, grouping sentences, which are logically connected.
# we number inline in brackets, so the lookup is easy
# we reference these numbers in comments over each rule or group of rules

      file MUST be defined in the /etc/group file. (4) Every group SHOULD only contain the users that
      are absolutely necessary. (5) In networked systems, care MUST also be taken to ensure that user
      and group names (UIDs and GIDs) are assigned consistently in the system network if there is a
      possibility that the same UIDs or GIDs could be assigned to different user or group names on

      (1) Only Secure Shell (SSH) SHOULD be used to create an encrypted and authenticated interactive

      Secure Shell SHOULD be disabled completely. (3) For authentication, users SHOULD primarily
      use certificates instead of passwords.
    notes: >-
      Section 1: this should be the default. We do not add the sshd_allow_only_protocol2 rule,
      as RHCOS ships with a openssh-server version, which doesnt support other protocols anyway.
      Checking for an option without effect does not provide any value.
      Section 2: this should be the default
      Section 3: The requirement says PRIMARILY use certificate, not disallow PasswordAuthentication
      completely. But since the disabled root login is the default, we use this as known good.
      RHCOS Context: A more secure variant would be to disable SSH completely. As it is
      not always needed, since MachineConfigs can configure the local machine.
