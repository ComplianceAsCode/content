          In case where card holder data may be stored on worker nodes disks, OpenShift Container
          Platform can help to partially
          comply with this requirement by providing several means of fully encrypting disks.
          * Using RHEL core crypto components which are FIPS certified
          * Or using cloud provider techniques, such as EBS encryption for AWS case.
          For this requirement, we also check etcd is encrypted, so that secrets, but also routes
          and oauth configurations are secured.

          Concerning Full Disk Encryption:
          Full Disk Encryption can be enabled on OpenShift by installing the cluster with FIPS mode
          enabled.
          OpenShift Container Platform uses certain FIPS Validated / Modules in Process modules
          within RHEL and RHCOS for the operating system components that it uses.
          See RHEL7 core crypto components and https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.15/installing/installing-fips.html
          for further information.
          When installing the cluster, The public ssh key is passed to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux
          CoreOS (RHCOS) nodes through their Ignition config files and is used to authenticate SSH
          access to the nodes. The key is added to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys list for the core user
          on each node, which enables password-less authentication.

          The management of the private key is up to the customer.
          LUKS/dm-crypt (used by the FIPS mode) provides full-disk encryption that fulfills Req-3.4.1.
          Access to the stored data is only possible via a decryption password that must be entered
          when the disk is mounted .
          The disk can be encrypted using a TPM v2, a secure cryptoprocessor contained 
          within a server; or a Tang server, a network-bound disk encryption (NBDE).

          The NBDE Tang Server Operator can provide automatic unlocking of LUKS-encrypted volumes
          and key rotation.

          * When Full Disk Encryption is done using AWS EBS encryption, the algorithm used is
            AES-256.
            Your data key is stored on disk with your encrypted data, but not before EBS encrypts it
            with your KMS key.
            Your data key never appears on disk in plaintext.
            The same data key is shared by snapshots of the volume and any subsequent volumes
            created from those snapshots.
            See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html
          * When Full Disk Encryption is done using LUKS with TPM2, full disk encryption utilities
            such as dm-crypt and
            BitLocker encrypt disks with a TPM bind key, and then store the TPM bind key in the TPM
            (Trusted Platform Module),
            which is a secure element attached to the motherboard of the node.
            The main benefit of this method is that there is no external dependency, and the node is
            able to decrypt its own
            disks at boot time without any external interaction.
          * When Full Disk Encryption is done using LUKS with Tang, the booting node attempts to
            contact a predefined set
            of Tang servers by performing a cryptographic handshake. If it can reach the required
            number of Tang servers,
            the node can construct its disk decryption key and unlock the disks to continue booting.

          This requirement largely depends on the solution chosen by the customer to protect card

          * When Full Disk Encryption is done using AWS EBS encryption, the data key, used for
            volume encryption, is generated
            by AWS KMS, encrypted with the Key Encryption Key that lies in the KMS and stored with
            the volume metadata, by EBS.
            It is the payment entity's responsibility to limit the access to this key by ensuring
            that Grant requests to decrypt
            the data key using the KEK (Key Encryption Key) is given only to the need to know users
            or AWS resources.
            See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html
          * When Full Disk Encryption is done using LUKS with TPM2, the TPM bind key, which is used
          to decrypt the data key is
            stored in the TPM (Trusted Platform Module), on the motherboard of the node.
            It is therefore not shared with anyone.
          * When Full Disk Encryption is done using LUKS with Tang, Tang server does not store the
          encryption key directly,
            and never interacts with it. The metadata needed to decrypt the volume is stored on the
            disk but can only be
            unlocked and used when the node can correctly establish the handshake with the Tang
            server. The data key is therefore not shared with anyone.
