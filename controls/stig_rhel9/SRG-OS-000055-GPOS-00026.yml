            The technology supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of compliance.
            The technology inherently meets this requirement.
        fix: |-
            The technology inherently meets this requirement.
            No fix is required.
        artifact_description: |-
            The "ausearch" tool manpage describes how it can be used to search for audit records based on their associated timestamps: http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ausearch.8.html.
        status_justification:
            The default setup of "rsyslog" uses timestamps and the default setup of "chronyd" uses the system clock.
