    title: Minimization of installed services
    description: >-
      Only the components strictly necessary to the service provided by the system should
      be installed.
      Those whose presence can not be justified should be disabled, removed or deleted.
    status: partial  # The list of essential services is not objective.
    notes: >-
      Performing a minimal install is a good starting point, but doesn't provide any assurance
      over any package installed later.
      Manual review is required to assess if the installed services are minimal.
      In general, use of obsolete or insecure services is not recommended and we remove some
      of these in this recommendation.

      minimum.

      the bare necessities.

    title: Using access control features
    description: >-
      It is recommended to use the mandatory access control (MAC) features in
      addition to the traditional Unix user model (DAC), or possibly combine
      them with partitioning mechanisms.
    notes: >-

    description: >-
      Under Unix and derivatives, defense in depth must be based on a combination of
      barriers that must be kept independent of each other.
    status: partial
    notes: >-
      Defense in-depth can be broadly divided into three areas - physical, technical and
      administrative. The security profile is best suited to protect the technical area.
      Among the barriers that can be implemented within the technical area are antivirus software,
      authentication, multi-factor authentication, encryption, logging, auditing, sandboxing,
      intrusion detection systems, firewalls and vulnerability scanners.
      The selection below is not in any way exaustive and should be adapted to the system's needs.

      This avoids having other potentially affected services if one of them gets
      compromised under the same environment.

      It is not trivial to distinguish an official repository from an unofficial one.
      We cannot draw conclusions from the repo name or URL of the repo (as they can be arbitrary or behind a proxy).
      One approach to check the origin of installed packages is to check the signature of the packages.
      If the public key of a repository is not installed, the repo is not trusted.

    notes: >-
      By disabling direct root logins proper accountability is ensured.

      passwords, root authority certificates, public keys, or certificates of the
      host (and their respective private key).
    notes: >-
      This concerns two aspects, the first is administrative, and involves prompt
      installation of secrets or trusted elements by the sysadmin.
      The second involves removal of any default secret or trusted element
      configured by the operating system during install process, e.g. default
      known passwords.

    title: User session timeout
    description: >-
      Remote user sessions (shell access, graphical clients) must be closed
      after a certain period of inactivity.
    notes: >-
      There is no specific capability to check remote user inactivity, but some shells allow the
      session inactivity time out to be configured via TMOUT variable.
      In OpenSSH < 8.2 the inactivity of the user is implied from the network inactivity.
      The server is configured to disconnect sessions if no data has been received within the idle timeout,
      regardless of liveness status (ClientAliveCountMax is 0 and ClientAliveInterval is > 0).
      In OpenSSH >= 8.2 there is no way to disconnect sessions based on client liveness.
      The semantics of "ClientAliveCountMax 0" has changed from "disconnect on first timeout" to
      "don't disconnect network inactive sessions". The server either probes for the client liveness
      or keeps inactive sessions connected.

    title: Group dedicated to the use of sudo
    description: >-
      A group dedicated to the use of sudo must be created, and only members of this
      group are allowed to execute sudo.
    notes: >-
      The rules below create and configure a group named sudogrp, to change the group customize the
      value of var_sudo_dedicated_group.

    title: Limiting the number of commands requiring the use of the EXEC option
    description: >-
      The commands requiring the execution of sub-processes (EXEC tag) must be
      explicitly listed and their use should be reduced to a strict minimum.
    notes: >-
      Human review is required to assess if the set of commands requiring EXEC is minimal.
      An auxiliary rule could list rules containing EXEC tag, for analysis.

    title: Good use of sudoedit
    description: A file requiring sudo to be edited, must be edited through the sudoedit command.
    notes: >-
      In R62 we established that the sudoers files should not use negations, thus the approach
      for this requirement is to ensure that sudoedit is the only text editor allowed.
      But it is difficult to ensure that allowed binaries aren't text editors without human
      review.

    title: Enabling SELinux Targeted Policy

      It is recommended to enable the targeted policy when the distribution
      support it and that it does not operate another security module than SELinux.

    title: Setting SELinux booleans
    description: >-
      It is recommended to set the following Booleans:
      allow_execheap to off, forbids processes to make their heap executable;
      allow_execmem to off, forbids processes to have both write and execute rights on memory pages;
      allow_execstack to off, forbids processes to make their stack executable;
      secure_mode_insmod to on, prohibits dynamic loading of modules by any process;
      ssh_sysadm_login to off, forbids SSH logins to connect directly in sysadmin role.
    notes:
      In RHEL, the SELinux boolean allow_execheap is renamed to selinuxuser_execheap, and the
      boolean allow_execstack is renamed to selinuxuser_execstack. And allow_execmem is not
      available, deny_execmem provides the same functionality.

    title: Confining interactive non-privileged users
    description: >-
      Interactive non-privileged users of a system must be confined by associating them with a SELinux confined user.
    notes: Interactive users who still need to perform administrative tasks should not be confined with user_u.
