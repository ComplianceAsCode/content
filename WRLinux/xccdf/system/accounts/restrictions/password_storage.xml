<title>Proper Storage and Existence of Password Hashes</title>
<description>
By default, password hashes for local accounts are stored in the second field (colon-separated) in <tt>/etc/shadow</tt>.
This file should be readable only by processes running with root credentials, preventing users from casually accessing others' password hashes and attempting to crack them.
However, it remains possible to misconfigure the system and store password hashes in world-readable files such as <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>, or to even store passwords themselves in plaintext on the system.
Using system-provided tools for password change/creation should allow administrators to avoid such misconfiguration.

<Rule id="no_empty_passwords" severity="high">
<title>Log In to Accounts With Empty Password Impossible</title>
<description>
If an account is configured for password authentication but does not have an assigned password, it may be possible to log into the account without authentication.
Remove any instances of the <tt>nullok</tt> option in <tt>/etc/pam.d/system-auth</tt> to prevent logins with empty passwords.
</description>
<ocil clause="NULL passwords can be used">
To verify that null passwords cannot be used, run the following command:
<pre># grep nullok /etc/pam.d/common-auth</pre>
If this produces any output, it may be possible to log into accounts with empty passwords.
</ocil>
<rationale>
If an account has an empty password, anyone could log in and run commands with the privileges of that account.
Accounts with empty passwords should never be used in operational environments.
<br/>
Note that if the output includes <tt>nullok-secure</tt> but not <tt>nullok</tt>, then the vulnerability is limited to the specified set of terminals listed in <tt>/etc/securetty</tt>.

<Rule id="accounts_password_all_shadowed" severity="medium">
<title>Password Hashes For Each Account Shadowed</title>
<description>
If any password hashes are stored in <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> (in the second field, instead of an <tt>x</tt>), the cause of this misconfiguration should be investigated.
Every affected account should have its password reset and the hash should be properly stored, or the account should be deleted entirely.
</description>
<ocil clause="any stored hashes are found in /etc/passwd">
To check that no password hashes are stored in <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>, run the following command:
<pre># awk -F: '($2 != "x") {print}' /etc/passwd</pre>
If it produces any output, then a password hash is stored in <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>.
</ocil>
<rationale>
The hashes for all user account passwords should be stored in the file <tt>/etc/shadow</tt> and never in <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>, which is readable by all users.

<Rule id="no_netrc_files" severity="medium">
<title>netrc Files Do Not Exist</title>
<description>
The <tt>.netrc</tt> files contain login information used to auto-login into FTP servers and reside in the user's home directory.
These files may contain unencrypted passwords to remote FTP servers making them susceptible to access by unauthorized users and should not be used.
Any <tt>.netrc</tt> files should be removed.
</description>
<ocil clause="any .netrc files exist">
To check the system for the existence of any <tt>.netrc</tt> files, run the following command:
<!-- limit the search to home directories -->
<pre># find `cut -d : -f 6 /etc/passwd` -xdev -name .netrc 2>/dev/null</pre>
</ocil>
<rationale>
Unencrypted passwords for remote FTP servers may be stored in <tt>.netrc</tt> files.
DoD policy requires passwords be encrypted in storage and not used in access scripts.
