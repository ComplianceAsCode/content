= How to perform a semi-automatic release =

=== Prerequisities ===

* System with `python3.6` or greater, installed https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyGithub/1.35[PyGithub] module.
* A GitHub token - get one on https://github.com/settings/tokens. Choose `repo` scope.
* Your Jenkins user - your User ID should be the same as your GitHub handle, to be sure, check your profile page in Jenkins.
* A Jenkins token - gnerate a token on Configure page in Jenkins

=== Prep ===

* Clone a clean `content` repository:

   git clone https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content.git

* Create `.env` file
+
Create an `.env` file in the `release_tools` directory (i.e. where the release scripts are). +
This will contain sensitive information, s.a. GitHub access tokens. +
Put your GitHub token in the `.env` file, so it contains the following line: +

   GITHUB_TOKEN='<your github token here>'
   JENKINS_USER='<you jenkins user ID>'
   JENKINS_TOKEN='<you jenkins token here>'

[NOTE]
====
You can also use your own fork of the project to test and debug the release tools, define in `.env` file the owner and name of the repo to use.

   OWNER="--owner <owner of repo>"
   REPO="--repo <name of repo>"

====

=== Check Phase ===

* Make sure version in `CMakeLists.txt` is correct
* Run `$ PYTHONPATH=. utils/generate_contributors.py` to update the contributors list.
+
Make a commit and PR it.
* Run `$ check.sh`.
+
It will check state of your repo for the release; +
Verify the status of link:https://jenkins.complianceascode.io/job/scap-security-guide/[Build],
link:https://jenkins.complianceascode.io/job/scap-security-guide-scapval-scap-1.2/[SCAPVal 1.2],
link:https://jenkins.complianceascode.io/job/scap-security-guide-scapval-scap-1.3/[SCAPVal 1.3],
link:https://jenkins.complianceascode.io/job/scap-security-guide-nightly-zip/[Nightly zip],
https://jenkins.complianceascode.io/job/scap-security-guide-nightly-oval510-zip/[Nightly OVAl 5.10 zip]
Jobs; +
And run check for missing STIG IDs in STIG profiles for RHEL6 and RHEL7. +
**Review the status** of missing STIG IDs in `rhel6-stig-ids.log` and `rhel7-stig-ids.log` files, fix if necessary. +
If everything seems fine, continue to build phase.

=== Build Phase ===


* Run `build.sh`.
+
It will generate the source tarball and trigger build of the zipfile and docs in Jenkins. +
You can run `build.sh` again to check status of the builds. +
Continue to next section when told so. +
NOTE: As of July-20th 2019, the builds takes about 44 minutes to finish.

* Run `release-notes.sh`
+
It will go though the milestone and output release notes into `release-notes.txt`. +
**Review it** and make changes if necessary.

=== Release ===

* Run `release.sh`
+
It will create the next milestone, move in open issues and PRs from current milestone and close it. +
The assets and the release notes will be used to create the git release. +
**Review the Git Release** and publish it

=== Clean up and bump version ===

* Run `cleanup.sh`
+
It will cleanup the release process, remove the artifacts and bump version for next release. +
**Commit** the bump and make a PR out of it.

=== Announce it ===
* Announce on link:https://lists.fedorahosted.org/admin/lists/scap-security-guide.lists.fedorahosted.org/[scap-security-guide] and link:https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/open-scap-list[open-scap] mailing lists.
* Announce on twitter via link:https://twitter.com/openscap[@OpenSCAP]
