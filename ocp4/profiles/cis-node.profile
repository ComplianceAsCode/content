    - kubelet_configure_client_ca
  # 4.2.4 Ensure that the --read-only-port argument is set to 0

  # 4.2.6 Ensure that the --protect-kernel-defaults argument is set to true
    # - like kubelet_anonymous_auth_disabled but check that protectKernelDefaults is set to true
    # FIXME(jhrozek): This does not seem to be set in OCP explicitly and the code seems to suggest
    # that the default is false? Need to confirm
  # 4.2.7 Ensure that the --make-iptables-util-chains argument is set to true
    - kubelet_enable_iptables_util_chains
    # - like kubelet_anonymous_auth_disabled but check for makeIPTablesUtilChains is NOT set to false (true is the default)
  # 4.2.8 Ensure that the --hostname-override argument is not set (Manual)
    # FIXME: systemd probe to check that the service.execStart does NOT contain --hostname-override. This is
    # runtime flag only, no config value
  # 4.2.9 Ensure that the --event-qps argument is set to 0 or a level which ensures appropriate event capture
    # - like kubelet_anonymous_auth_disabled but check for kubeAPIQPS set to 50
  # 4.2.10 Ensure that the --tls-cert-file and --tls-private-key-file arguments are set as appropriate
    # - this is a platform rule (reads from a CM)
  # 4.2.11 Ensure that the --rotate-certificates argument is not set to false
    - kubelet_enable_client_cert_rotation
    - kubelet_enable_cert_rotation
  # 4.2.12 Verify that the RotateKubeletServerCertificate argument is set to true
