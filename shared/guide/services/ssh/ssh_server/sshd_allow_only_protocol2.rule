title: 'Allow Only SSH Protocol 2'

description: |-
    Only SSH protocol version 2 connections should be
    permitted. The default setting in
    <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt> is correct, and can be
    verified by ensuring that the following
    line appears:
    <pre>Protocol 2</pre>

rationale: |-
    SSH protocol version 1 is an insecure implementation of the SSH protocol and
    has many well-known vulnerability exploits. Exploits of the SSH daemon could provide
    immediate root access to the system.

ocil: |-
    To check which SSH protocol version is allowed, check version of <tt>openssh-server</tt> with following command:
    <pre>$ rpm -qi openssh-server | grep Version</pre>
    Versions equal to or higher than 7.4 only allow Protocol 2.
    If version is lower than 7.4, run the following command to check configuration:
    <pre>$ sudo grep Protocol /etc/ssh/sshd_config</pre>
    If configured properly, output should be <pre>Protocol 2</pre>
