title: 'Disable SSH Support for User Known Hosts'

description: |-
    SSH can allow system users user host-based authentication to connect
    to systems if a cache of the remote systems public keys are available.
    This should be disabled.
    <br /><br />
    To ensure this behavior is disabled, add or correct the
    following line in <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt>:
    <pre>IgnoreUserKnownHosts yes</pre>

rationale: |-
    Configuring this setting for the SSH daemon provides additional
    assurance that remove login via SSH will require a password, even
    in the event of misconfiguration elsewhere.
