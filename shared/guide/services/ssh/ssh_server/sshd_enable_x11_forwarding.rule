title: 'Enable Encrypted X11 Forwarding'

description: |-
    By default, remote X11 connections are not encrypted when initiated
    by users. SSH has the capability to encrypt remote X11 connections when SSH's
    <tt>X11Forwarding</tt> option is enabled.
    <br /><br />
    To enable X11 Forwarding, add or correct the
    following line in <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt>:
    <pre>X11Forwarding yes</pre>

rationale: |-
    Open X displays allow an attacker to capture keystrokes and to execute commands
    remotely.
