title: 'Disable Compression Or Set Compression to <tt>delayed</tt>'

description: |-
    Compression is useful for slow network connections over long
    distances but can cause performance issues on local LANs. If use of compression
    is required, it should be enabled only after a user has authenticated; otherwise
    , it should be disabled. To disable compression or delay compression until after
    a user has successfully authenticated, add or correct the following line in the
    <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt> file:
    <pre>Compression no</pre> or <pre>Compression delayed</pre>

rationale: |-
    If compression is allowed in an SSH connection prior to authentication,
    vulnerabilities in the compression software could result in compromise of the
    system from an unauthenticated connection, potentially wih root privileges.

    To check if compression is enabled or set correctly, run the
    following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep Compression /etc/ssh/sshd_config</pre>
    If configured properly, output should be <pre>no</pre> or <pre>delayed</pre>.
