title: 'Disable Certmonger Service (certmonger)'

description: |-
    Certmonger is a D-Bus based service that attempts to simplify interaction
    with certifying authorities on networks which use public-key infrastructure. It is often
    combined with Red Hat's IPA (Identity Policy Audit) security information management
    solution to aid in the management of certificates.
    <systemd-service-macro enable="false" service="certmonger" />

rationale: |-
    The services provided by certmonger may be essential for systems
    fulfilling some roles a PKI infrastructure, but its functionality is not necessary
    for many other use cases.
