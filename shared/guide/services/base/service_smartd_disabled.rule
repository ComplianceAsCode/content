title: 'Disable SMART Disk Monitoring Service (smartd)'

description: |-
    SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) is a
    feature of hard drives that allows them to detect symptoms of disk failure and
    relay an appropriate warning.
    <systemd-service-macro enable="false" service="smartd" />

rationale: |-
    SMART can help protect against denial of
    service due to failing hardware. Nevertheless, if it is not needed or the
    system's drives are not SMART-capable (such as solid state drives), it can be
    disabled.
