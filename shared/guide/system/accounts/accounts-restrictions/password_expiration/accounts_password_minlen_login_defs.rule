title: 'Set Password Minimum Length in login.defs'

description: "To specify password length requirements for new accounts,\nedit the file <tt>/etc/login.defs</tt> and add or correct the following\nline:\n<pre>PASS_MIN_LEN <sub idref=\"var_accounts_password_minlen_login_defs\" /></pre>\n<br /><br />\nThe DoD requirement is <tt>15</tt>. \nThe FISMA requirement is <tt>12</tt>.\nThe profile requirement is <tt><sub idref=\"var_accounts_password_minlen_login_defs\" /></tt>.\nIf a program consults <tt>/etc/login.defs</tt> and also another PAM module\n(such as <tt>pam_pwquality</tt>) during a password change operation,\nthen the most restrictive must be satisfied. See PAM section\nfor more information about enforcing password quality requirements."

rationale: |-
    Requiring a minimum password length makes password
    cracking attacks more difficult by ensuring a larger
    search space. However, any security benefit from an onerous requirement
    must be carefully weighed against usability problems, support costs, or counterproductive
    behavior that may result.
