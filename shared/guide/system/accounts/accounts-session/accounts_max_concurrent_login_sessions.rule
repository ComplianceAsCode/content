title: 'Limit the Number of Concurrent Login Sessions Allowed Per User'

description: |-
    Limiting the number of allowed users and sessions per user can limit risks related to Denial of
    Service attacks. This addresses concurrent sessions for a single account and does not address
    concurrent sessions by a single user via multiple accounts. To set the number of concurrent
    sessions per user add the following line in <tt>/etc/security/limits.conf</tt>:
    <pre>* hard maxlogins <sub idref="var_accounts_max_concurrent_login_sessions" /></pre>

rationale: |-
    Limiting simultaneous user logins can insulate the system from denial of service
    problems caused by excessive logins. Automated login processes operating improperly or
    maliciously may result in an exceptional number of simultaneous login sessions.
