title: 'Ensure the Default Umask is Set Correctly in /etc/profile'

description: |-
    To ensure the default umask controlled by <tt>/etc/profile</tt> is set properly,
    add or correct the <tt>umask</tt> setting in <tt>/etc/profile</tt> to read as follows:
    <pre>umask <sub idref="var_accounts_user_umask" /></pre>

rationale: |-
    The umask value influences the permissions assigned to files when they are created.
    A misconfigured umask value could result in files with excessive permissions that can be read or
    written to by unauthorized users.
