title: 'Configure auditd Number of Logs Retained'

description: |-
    Determine how many log files
    <tt>auditd</tt> should retain when it rotates logs.
    Edit the file <tt>/etc/audit/auditd.conf</tt>. Add or modify the following
    line, substituting <i>NUMLOGS</i> with the correct value of <sub idref="var_auditd_num_logs" />:
    <pre>num_logs = <i>NUMLOGS</i></pre>
    Set the value to 5 for general-purpose systems.
    Note that values less than 2 result in no log rotation.

rationale: |-
    The total storage for audit log files must be large enough to retain
    log information over the period required. This is a function of the maximum log
    file size and the number of logs retained.

    <tt>$ sudo grep num_logs /etc/audit/auditd.conf</tt>
    <pre>num_logs = 5</pre>
