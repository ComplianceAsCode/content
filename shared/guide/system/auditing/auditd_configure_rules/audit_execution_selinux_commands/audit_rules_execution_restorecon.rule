title: 'Record Any Attempts to Run <tt>restorecon</tt>'

description: |-
    At a minimum, the audit system should collect any execution attempt
    of the <tt>restorecon</tt> command for all users and root. If the <tt>auditd</tt>
    daemon is configured to use the <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules
    during daemon startup (the default), add the following lines to a file with suffix
    <tt>.rules</tt> in the directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>:
    <pre>-a always,exit -F path=/usr/sbin/restorecon -F perm=x -F auid&gt;=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -F key=privileged-priv_change</pre>
    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>
    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following lines to
    <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file:
    <pre>-a always,exit -F path=/usr/sbin/restorecon -F perm=x -F auid&gt;=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -F key=privileged-priv_change</pre>

rationale: |-
    Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by
    authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised system accounts,
    is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations.
    Auditing the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse and identify
    the risk from insider and advanced persistent threast.
    <br /><br />
    Privileged programs are subject to escalation-of-privilege attacks,
    which attempt to subvert their normal role of providing some necessary but
    limited capability. As such, motivation exists to monitor these programs for
    unusual activity.

ocil: |-
    To verify that execution of the command is being audited, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep "path=/usr/sbin/restorecon" /etc/audit/audit.rules /etc/audit/rules.d/*</pre>
    The output should return something similar to:
    <pre>-a always,exit -F path=/usr/sbin/restorecon -F perm=x -F auid&gt;=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -F key=privileged-priv_change</pre>
