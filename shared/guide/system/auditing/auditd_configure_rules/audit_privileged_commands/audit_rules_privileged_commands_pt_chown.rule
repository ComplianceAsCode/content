title: 'Ensure <tt>auditd</tt> Collects Information on the Use of Privileged Commands - pt_chown'

description: |-
    At a minimum, the audit system should collect the execution of
    privileged commands for all users and root. If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is
    configured to use the <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules during
    daemon startup (the default), add a line of the following form to a file with
    suffix <tt>.rules</tt> in the directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>:
    <pre>-a always,exit -F path=/usr/libexec/pt_chown -F perm=x -F auid&gt;=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -F key=privileged</pre>
    If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>
    utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add a line of the following
    form to <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt>:
    <pre>-a always,exit -F path=/usr/libexec/pt_chown -F perm=x -F auid&gt;=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -F key=privileged</pre>

rationale: |-
    Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by
    authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised system accounts,
    is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations.
    Auditing the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse and identify
    the risk from insider and advanced persistent threast.
    <br /><br />
    Privileged programs are subject to escalation-of-privilege attacks,
    which attempt to subvert their normal role of providing some necessary but
    limited capability. As such, motivation exists to monitor these programs for
    unusual activity.

    To verify that auditing of privileged command use is configured, run the
    following command:
    <pre>$ sudo grep pt_chown /etc/audit/audit.rules /etc/audit/rules.d/*</pre>
    It should return a relevant line in the audit rules.
