title: 'The Installed Operating System Is Vendor Supported and Certified'

description: |-
    The installed operating system must be maintained and certified by a vendor.
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux is supported by Red Hat, Inc. As the Red Hat Enterprise
    Linux vendor, Red Hat, Inc. is responsible for providing security patches as well
    as meeting and maintaining goverment certifications and standards.

rationale: |-
    An operating system is considered "supported" if the vendor continues to provide
    security patches for the product as well as maintain government certification requirements.
    With an unsupported release, it will not be possible to resolve security issue discovered in
    the system software as well as meet government certifications.
