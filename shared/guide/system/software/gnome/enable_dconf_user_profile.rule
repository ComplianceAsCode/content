title: 'Configure GNOME3 DConf User Profile'

description: "By default, DConf provides a standard user profile. This profile contains a list\nof DConf configuration databases. The user profile and database always take the\nhighest priority. As such the DConf User profile should always exist and be\nconfigured correctly. \n<br /><br />\nTo make sure that the user profile is configured correctly, the <tt>/etc/dconf/profile/user</tt> should be set as follows:\n<pre>user-db:user\nsystem-db:local\nsystem-db:site\nsystem-db:distro\n</pre>"

rationale: |-
    Failure to have a functional DConf profile prevents GNOME3 configuration settings
    from being enforced for all users and allows various security risks.
