title: 'Ensure Logs Sent To Remote Host'

description: |-
    To configure rsyslog to send logs to a remote log server,
    open <tt>/etc/rsyslog.conf</tt> and read and understand the last section of the file,
    which describes the multiple directives necessary to activate remote
    logging.
    Along with these other directives, the system can be configured
    to forward its logs to a particular log server by
    adding or correcting one of the following lines,
    substituting <tt><i>loghost.example.com</i></tt> appropriately.
    The choice of protocol depends on the environment of the system;
    although TCP and RELP provide more reliable message delivery,
    they may not be supported in all environments.
    <br />
    To use UDP for log message delivery:
    <pre>*.* @<i>loghost.example.com</i></pre>
    <br />
    To use TCP for log message delivery:
    <pre>*.* @@<i>loghost.example.com</i></pre>
    <br />
    To use RELP for log message delivery:
    <pre>*.* :omrelp:<i>loghost.example.com</i></pre>
    <br />
    There must be a resolvable DNS CNAME or Alias record set to "<sub idref="rsyslog_remote_loghost_address" />" for logs to be sent correctly to the centralized logging utility.

rationale: |-
    A log server (loghost) receives syslog messages from one or more
    systems. This data can be used as an additional log source in the event a
    system is compromised and its local logs are suspect. Forwarding log messages
    to a remote loghost also provides system administrators with a centralized
    place to view the status of multiple hosts within the enterprise.

ocil: |-
    To ensure logs are sent to a remote host, examine the file
    <tt>/etc/rsyslog.conf</tt>.
    If using UDP, a line similar to the following should be present:
    <pre> *.* @<i>loghost.example.com</i></pre>
    If using TCP, a line similar to the following should be present:
    <pre> *.* @@<i>loghost.example.com</i></pre>
    If using RELP, a line similar to the following should be present:
    <pre> *.* :omrelp:<i>loghost.example.com</i></pre>
