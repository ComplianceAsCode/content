title: 'Configure Kernel Parameter for Accepting Source-Routed Packets for All Interfaces'

description: '<sysctl-desc-macro sysctl="net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route" value="0" />'

rationale: "Source-routed packets allow the source of the packet to suggest routers\nforward the packet along a different path than configured on the router, which can\nbe used to bypass network security measures. This requirement applies only to the\nforwarding of source-routerd traffic, such as when IPv4 forwarding is enabled and \nthe system is functioning as a router.\n<br /><br />\nAccepting source-routed packets in the IPv4 protocol has few legitimate\nuses. It should be disabled unless it is absolutely required."
