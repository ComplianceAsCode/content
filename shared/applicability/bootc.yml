title: Bootable containers
# Matches:
# - bootc (RHEL Image Mode) containers and container images
# - running bootc (RHEL Image Mode) systems
# Does not match:
# - classic containers and container images
# - normal bare-metal systems or VMs
# - other rpm-ostree based systems eg. Silverblue
#
# The matching platforms and non-matching platforms can be easily distinguished
# by checking for presence of the kernel, rpm-ostree, and bootc RPM packages.
# Bootable containers and running bootc systems both contain these packages.
# Normal bare-metal systems usually don't have the rpm-ostree, normal
# containers don't contain kernel.
