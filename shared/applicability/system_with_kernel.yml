title: Bare-metal systems, virtual machines, bootc container images, running bootc systems
# Common platform for all systems that aren't containers
# Matches:
# - normal bare-metal systems or VMs
# - running bootc (RHEL Image Mode) systems
# - bootc (RHEL Image Mode) containers and container images
# Does not match:
# - classic containers and container images
#
# The matching platforms and non-matching platforms can be easily distinguished
# by checking for presence of the kernel RPM package. All matching platforms
# have in common that they contain kernel.
#
# In most cases, this platform is assigned to rules where the "machine" platform
# was set in past.
