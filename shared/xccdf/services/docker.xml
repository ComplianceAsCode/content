  The docker service is necessary to create containers, which are
  self-sufficient and self-contained applications using the resource
  isolation features of the kernel.

<title>Use direct-lvm with the Device Mapper Storage Driver</title>
<description>
To use Docker in production with the device mapper storage driver, the Docker
daemon should be configured to use direct-lvm instead of loopback device as
a storage. For setting up the LVM and configuring Docker, see the
<weblink-macro link="https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/device-mapper-driver/"
text="Docker Device Mapper Storage Documentation"/>.
</description>
<rationale>
For using Docker in production, the device mapper storage driver with loopback
devices is discouraged. The suggested way of configuring device mapper storage
driver is direct-lvm. Choosing the right storage driver and backing filesystem
is crucial to stability and performance.
