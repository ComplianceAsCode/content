<title>Avahi Server</title>
<description>The Avahi daemon implements the DNS Service Discovery
and Multicast DNS protocols, which provide service and host
discovery on a network. It allows a system to automatically
identify resources on the network, such as printers or web servers.
This capability is also known as mDNSresponder and is a major part
of Zeroconf networking. </description>

<description>Because the Avahi daemon service keeps an open network
port, it is subject to network attacks.
Disabling it can reduce the system's vulnerability to such attacks.

Because the Avahi daemon service keeps an open network
port, it is subject to network attacks. Its functionality
is convenient but is only appropriate if the local network
can be trusted.

<title>Configure Avahi if Necessary</title>
<description>
If your system requires the Avahi daemon, its configuration can be restricted
to improve security. The Avahi daemon configuration file is
<tt>/etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf</tt>. The following security recommendations
should be applied to this file:
See the <tt>avahi-daemon.conf(5)</tt> man page, or documentation at
<weblink-macro link="http://www.avahi.org"/>, for more detailed information
about the configuration options.

<title>Serve Avahi Only via Required Protocol</title>
<description>
If you are using only IPv4, edit <tt>/etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf</tt> and ensure
the following line exists in the <tt>[server]</tt> section:
<pre>use-ipv6=no</pre>
Similarly, if you are using only IPv6, disable IPv4 sockets with the line:
<pre>use-ipv4=no</pre>

<Rule id="avahi_check_ttl" prodtype="rhel7">
<title>Check Avahi Responses' TTL Field</title>
<description>
To make Avahi ignore packets unless the TTL field is 255, edit
<tt>/etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf</tt> and ensure the following line
appears in the <tt>[server]</tt> section:
<pre>check-response-ttl=yes</pre>
</description>
<rationale>
This helps to ensure that only mDNS responses from the local network are
processed, because the TTL field in a packet is decremented from its initial
value of 255 whenever it is routed from one network to another. Although a
properly-configured router or firewall should not allow mDNS packets into
the local network at all, this option provides another check to ensure they
are not permitted.

<title>Restrict Information Published by Avahi</title>
<description>
If it is necessary to publish some information to the network, it should not be joined
by any extraneous information, or by information supplied by a non-trusted source
on the system.
Prevent user applications from using Avahi to publish services by adding or
correcting the following line in the <tt>[publish]</tt> section:
<pre>disable-user-service-publishing=yes</pre>
Implement as many of the following lines as possible, to restrict the information
published by Avahi.
<pre>publish-addresses=no
publish-hinfo=no
publish-workstation=no
publish-domain=no</pre>
Inspect the files in the directory <tt>/etc/avahi/services/</tt>. Unless there
is an operational need to publish information about each of these services,
delete the corresponding file.
</description>
<rationale>
These options prevent publishing attempts from succeeding,
and can be applied even if publishing is disabled entirely via
disable-publishing. Alternatively, these can be used to restrict
the types of published information in the event that some information
must be published.
