<title>Remediation function to fix syscall audit rule for given system call</title>
<description>Function to fix syscall audit rule for given system call. It is
based on example audit syscall rule definitions as outlined in
/usr/share/doc/audit-2.3.7/stig.rules file provided with the audit package. It
will combine multiple system calls belonging to the same syscall group into one
audit rule (rather than to create audit rule per different system call) to
avoid audit infrastructure performance penalty in the case of
'one-audit-rule-definition-per-one-system-call'. See:

	https://www.redhat.com/archives/linux-audit/2014-November/msg00009.html

for further details.

Expects five arguments (each of them is required) in the form of:
  * audit tool                          tool used to load audit rules,
                                        either 'auditctl', or 'augenrules
  * audit rules' pattern                audit rule skeleton for same syscall
  * syscall group                       greatest common string this rule shares
                                        with other rules from the same group
  * architecture                        architecture this rule is intended for
  * full form of new rule to add        expected full form of audit rule as to
                                        be added into audit.rules file

Note: The 2-th up to 4-th arguments are used to determine how many existing
audit rules will be inspected for resemblance with the new audit rule
(5-th argument) the function is going to add. The rule's similarity check
is performed to optimize audit.rules definition (merge syscalls of the same
group into one rule) to avoid the "single-syscall-per-audit-rule" performance
penalty.

Example call:

  PATTERN="-a always,exit -F arch=$ARCH -S .* -F auid>=500 -F auid!=4294967295 -k delete"
  # Use escaped BRE regex to specify rule group
  GROUP="\(rmdir\|unlink\|rename\)"
  FULL_RULE="-a always,exit -F arch=$ARCH -S rmdir -S unlink -S unlinkat -S rename -S renameat -F auid>=500 -F auid!=4294967295 -k delete"

<title>Remediation function to replace configuration setting in config file or

<description>Function to replace configuration setting in config file or add
the configuration setting if it does not exist.

Expects four arguments:

  config_file:		Configuration file that will be modified
  key:			Configuration option to change
  value:		Value of the configuration option to change
  cce:			The CCE identifier or '$CCENUM' if no CCE identifier exists

Optional arguments:

  format:		Optional argument to specify the format of how key/value should be
			modified/appended in the configuration file. The default is key = value.

Example Call(s):

  With default format of 'key = value':
  replace_or_append '/etc/sysctl.conf' '^kernel.randomize_va_space' '2' '$CCENUM'

  With custom key/value format:
  replace_or_append '/etc/sysconfig/selinux' '^SELINUX=' 'disabled' '$CCENUM' '%s=%s'

  With a variable:
  replace_or_append '/etc/sysconfig/selinux' '^SELINUX=' $var_selinux_state '$CCENUM' '%s=%s'
