<title>Root Shell Environment Assumed</title>
<description>
Most of the actions listed in this document are written with the
assumption that they will be executed by the root user running the
<tt>/bin/bash</tt> shell. Commands preceded with a hash mark (#)
assume that the administrator will execute the commands as root, i.e.
apply the command via <tt>sudo</tt> whenever possible, or use
<tt>su</tt> to gain root privileges if <tt>sudo</tt> cannot be
used. Commands which can be executed as a non-root user are are preceded
by a dollar sign ($) prompt.
