<title>Restrict Root Logins</title>
<description>
Direct root logins should be allowed only for emergency use.
In normal situations, the administrator should access the system
via a unique unprivileged account, and then use <tt>su</tt> or <tt>sudo</tt> to execute
privileged commands. Discouraging administrators from accessing the
root account directly ensures an audit trail in organizations with
multiple administrators. Locking down the channels through which
root can connect directly also reduces opportunities for
password-guessing against the root account. The <tt>login</tt> program
uses the file <tt>/etc/securetty</tt> to determine which interfaces
should allow root logins.

The virtual devices <tt>/dev/console</tt>
and <tt>/dev/tty*</tt> represent the system consoles (accessible via
the Ctrl-Alt-F1 through Ctrl-Alt-F6 keyboard sequences on a default
installation). The default securetty file also contains <tt>/dev/vc/*</tt>.
These are likely to be deprecated in most environments, but may be retained
for compatibility. Root should also be prohibited from connecting
via network protocols. Other sections of this document
include guidance describing how to prevent root from logging in via SSH.

<title>Direct root Logins Not Allowed</title>
<description>To further limit access to the <tt>root</tt> account, administrators
can disable root logins at the console by editing the <tt>/etc/securetty</tt> file.
This file lists all devices the root user is allowed to login to. If the file does
not exist at all, the root user can login through any communication device on the
system, whether via the console or via a raw network interface. This is dangerous
as user can login to the system as root via Telnet, which sends the password in
plain text over the network. By default, Red Hat Enteprise Linux's
<tt>/etc/securetty</tt> file only allows the root user to login at the console
physically attached to the system. To prevent root from logging in, remove the
contents of this file. To prevent direct root logins, remove the contents of this
file by typing the following command:
<pre>
$ sudo echo > /etc/securetty
</pre>
</description>
<ocil clause="the /etc/securetty file is not empty">
To ensure root may not directly login to the system over physical consoles,
run the following command:
<pre>cat /etc/securetty</pre>
If any output is returned, this is a finding.
</ocil>
<rationale>
Disabling direct root logins ensures proper accountability and multifactor
authentication to privileged accounts. Users will first login, then escalate
to privileged (root) access via su / sudo. This is required for FISMA Low
and FISMA Moderate systems.
