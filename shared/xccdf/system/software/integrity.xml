<title>System and Software Integrity</title>
<description>
System and software integrity can be gained by installing antivirus, increasing
system encryption strength with FIPS, verifying installed software, enabling SELinux,
installing an Intrusion Prevention System, etc. However, installing or enabling integrity
checking tools cannot <i>prevent</i> intrusions, but they can detect that an intrusion
may have occurred. Requirements for integrity checking may be highly dependent on
the environment in which the system will be used. Snapshot-based approaches such
as AIDE may induce considerable overhead in the presence of frequent software updates.

<title>Software Integrity Checking</title>
<description>
Both the AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment)
software and the RPM package management system provide
mechanisms for verifying the integrity of installed software.
AIDE uses snapshots of file metadata (such as hashes) and compares these
to current system files in order to detect changes.
<br /><br />
The RPM package management system can conduct integrity
checks by comparing information in its metadata database with
files installed on the system.

<description>AIDE conducts integrity checks by comparing information about
files with previously-gathered information. Ideally, the AIDE database is
created immediately after initial system configuration, and then again after any

<title>Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)</title>
<description>
The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) is a computer security standard which
is developed by the U.S. Government and industry working groups to validate the quality
of cryptographic modules. The FIPS standard provides four security levels to ensure
adequate coverage of different industries, implementation of cryptographic modules, and
organizational sizes and requirements.
<br /><br />
FIPS 140-2 is the current standard for validating that mechanisms used to access cryptographic modules
utilize authentication that meets industry and government requirements. For government systems, this allows
Security Levels 1, 2, 3, or 4 for use on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
