<description>The dynamic firewall daemon <tt>firewalld</tt> provides a
dynamically managed firewall with support for network &#8220;zones&#8221; to assign
a level of trust to a network and its associated connections and interfaces.
It has support for IPv4 and IPv6 firewall settings. It supports Ethernet
bridges and has a separation of runtime and permanent configuration options.
It also has an interface for services or applications to add firewall rules
directly.
<br />
A graphical configuration tool, <tt>firewall-config</tt>, is used to configure
<tt>firewalld</tt>, which in turn uses <tt>iptables</tt> tool to communicate
with <tt>Netfilter</tt> in the kernel which implements packet filtering.
<br />
The firewall service provided by <tt>firewalld</tt> is dynamic rather than
static because changes to the configuration can be made at anytime and are
immediately implemented. There is no need to save or apply the changes. No
unintended disruption of existing network connections occurs as no part of
the firewall has to be reloaded.

<title>Inspect and Activate Default firewalld Rules</title>
<description>Firewalls can be used to separate networks into different zones
based on the level of trust the user has decided to place on the devices and
traffic within that network. <tt>NetworkManager</tt> informs firewalld to which
zone an interface belongs. An interface's assigned zone can be changed by
<tt>NetworkManager</tt> or via the <tt>firewall-config</tt> tool.
<br />
The zone settings in <tt>/etc/firewalld/</tt> are a range of preset settings
which can be quickly applied to a network interface. These are the zones
provided by firewalld sorted according to the default trust level of the
zones from untrusted to trusted:
<ul>
<li><tt>drop</tt><br /><p>Any incoming network packets are dropped, there is no
reply. Only outgoing network connections are possible.</p></li>
<li><tt>block</tt><br /><p>Any incoming network connections are rejected with an
<tt>icmp-host-prohibited</tt> message for IPv4 and <tt>icmp6-adm-prohibited</tt>
for IPv6. Only network connections initiated from within the system are
possible.</p></li>
<li><tt>public</tt><br /><p>For use in public areas. You do not trust the other
computers on the network to not harm your computer. Only selected incoming
connections are accepted.</p></li>
<li><tt>external</tt><br /><p>For use on external networks with masquerading enabled
especially for routers. You do not trust the other computers on the network to
not harm your computer. Only selected incoming connections are accepted.</p></li>
<li><tt>dmz</tt><br /><p>For computers in your demilitarized zone that are
publicly-accessible with limited access to your internal network. Only selected
incoming connections are accepted.</p></li>
<li><tt>work</tt><br /><p>For use in work areas. You mostly trust the other computers
on networks to not harm your computer. Only selected incoming connections are
accepted.</p></li>
<li><tt>home</tt><br /><p>For use in home areas. You mostly trust the other computers
on networks to not harm your computer. Only selected incoming connections are
accepted.</p></li>
<li><tt>internal</tt><br /><p>For use on internal networks. You mostly trust the
other computers on the networks to not harm your computer. Only selected
incoming connections are accepted.</p></li>
<li><tt>trusted</tt><br /><p>All network connections are accepted.</p></li>
</ul>
<br />
It is possible to designate one of these zones to be the default zone. When
interface connections are added to <tt>NetworkManager</tt>, they are assigned
to the default zone. On installation, the default zone in firewalld is set to
be the public zone.
<br />
To find out all the settings of a zone, for example the <tt>public zone,</tt>
enter the following command as root:
<pre># firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all</pre>
Example output of this command might look like the following:
<pre>
# firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all
public
  interfaces:
  services: mdns dhcpv6-client ssh
  ports:
  forward-ports:
  icmp-blocks: source-quench
</pre>
To view the network zones currently active, enter the following command as root:
<pre># firewall-cmd --get-service</pre>
The following listing displays the result of this command on common Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 7 Server system:
<pre>
# firewall-cmd --get-service
amanda-client bacula bacula-client dhcp dhcpv6 dhcpv6-client dns ftp
high-availability http https imaps ipp ipp-client ipsec kerberos kpasswd

pmcd pmproxy pmwebapi pmwebapis pop3s postgresql proxy-dhcp radius rpc-bind
samba samba-client smtp ssh telnet tftp tftp-client transmission-client
vnc-server wbem-https
</pre>
Finally to view the network zones that will be active after the next firewalld
service reload, enter the following command as root:
<pre># firewall-cmd --get-service --permanent</pre>

<title>Strengthen the Default Ruleset</title>
<description>The default rules can be strengthened. The system
scripts that activate the firewall rules expect them to be defined
in configuration files under the <tt>/etc/firewalld/services</tt>
and <tt>/etc/firewalld/zones</tt> directories.
<br /><br />
The following recommendations describe how to strengthen the
default ruleset configuration file. An alternative to editing this
configuration file is to create a shell script that makes calls to
the <tt>firewall-cmd</tt> program to load in rules under the <tt>/etc/firewalld/services</tt>
and <tt>/etc/firewalld/zones</tt> directories.
<br /><br />
Instructions apply to both unless otherwise noted. Language and address
conventions for regular firewalld rules are used throughout this section.

DoS is a condition when a resource is not available for legitimate users. When
this occurs, the organization either cannot accomplish its mission or must
operate at degraded capacity.
<br /><br />
This requirement addresses the configuration of
the operating system to mitigate the impact of DoS attacks that have occurred or
are ongoing on system availability. For each system, known and potential DoS
attacks must be identified and solutions for each type implemented. A variety of
technologies exist to limit or, in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS
attacks (e.g., limiting processes or establishing memory partitions). Employing
increased capacity and bandwidth, combined with service redundancy, may reduce
the susceptibility to some DoS attacks.

Operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions
and services provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations.
Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single component
(e.g., VPN and IPS); however, doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component. 
<br /><br />
To support the requirements and principles of least functionality, the operating system must support the
organizational requirements, providing only essential capabilities and limiting the use of ports, protocols,
and/or services to only those required, authorized, and approved to conduct official business or to address
authorized quality of life issues.</rationale>
