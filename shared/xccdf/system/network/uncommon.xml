<title>Uncommon Network Protocols</title>
<description>The system includes support for several network
protocols which are not commonly used. Although security vulnerabilities 
in kernel networking code are not frequently
discovered, the consequences can be dramatic. Ensuring uncommon
network protocols are disabled reduces the system's risk to attacks
targeted at its implementation of those protocols.</description>
<warning>
Although these protocols are not commonly used, avoid disruption
in your network environment by ensuring they are not needed
prior to disabling them.

<title>Disable DCCP Support</title>
<description>
The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) is a
relatively new transport layer protocol, designed to support
streaming media and telephony.
