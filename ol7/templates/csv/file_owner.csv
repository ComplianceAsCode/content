# Directory or file ownership
# The format is: 
#
# PATH,USER[,[ALT_NAME],[directory|file],[PATHREGEX]]
# 
# The first column is the full path (include file name if the type is file).
# The second column is the user the directory or file should belong to.
# The third column is optional alternative name, it overwrites the convention. 
# The fourth column is optional, it indicates if the type is directory or file.
# Default is file.
# The fifth column is optional, it's the regular expression of the path as defined
# for OVAL in http://oval.mitre.org/language/about/re_support_5.6.html.
# Remediation files will only be generated from template if the fifth column does not
# exist or is empty. Please write individual remediations when using regex.
