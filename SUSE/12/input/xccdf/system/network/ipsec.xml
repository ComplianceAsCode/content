<title>Verify Any Configured IPSec Tunnel Connections</title>
<description>Libreswan provides an implementation of IPsec
and IKE, which permits the creation of secure tunnels over
untrusted networks. As such, IPsec can be used to circumvent certain
network requirements such as filtering. Verify that if any IPsec connection
(<tt>conn</tt>) configured in <tt>/etc/ipsec.conf</tt> and <tt>/etc/ipsec.d</tt>
exists is an approved organizational connection.
</description>
<ocil clause="the IPSec tunnels are not approved" >
To check for configured IPsec connections (<tt>conn</tt>), perform the following:
<pre>grep -rni conn /etc/ipsec.conf /etc/ipsec.d/</pre>
Verify any returned results for organizational approval.
</ocil>
<rationale>
IP tunneling mechanisms can be used to bypass network filtering.
