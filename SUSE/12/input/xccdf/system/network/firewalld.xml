<description>The dynamic firewall daemon <tt>firewalld</tt> provides a
dynamically managed firewall with support for network “zones” to assign
a level of trust to a network and its associated connections and interfaces.
It has support for IPv4 and IPv6 firewall settings. It supports Ethernet
bridges and has a separation of runtime and permanent configuration options.
It also has an interface for services or applications to add firewall rules
directly.
<br/>
A graphical configuration tool, <tt>firewall-config</tt>, is used to configure
<tt>firewalld</tt>, which in turn uses <tt>iptables</tt> tool to communicate
with <tt>Netfilter</tt> in the kernel which implements packet filtering.
<br/>
The firewall service provided by <tt>firewalld</tt> is dynamic rather than
static because changes to the configuration can be made at anytime and are
immediately implemented. There is no need to save or apply the changes. No
unintended disruption of existing network connections occurs as no part of
the firewall has to be reloaded.

<title>Inspect and Activate Default firewalld Rules</title>
<description>Firewalls can be used to separate networks into different zones
based on the level of trust the user has decided to place on the devices and
traffic within that network. <tt>NetworkManager</tt> informs firewalld to which
zone an interface belongs. An interface's assigned zone can be changed by
<tt>NetworkManager</tt> or via the <tt>firewall-config</tt> tool.
<br/>
The zone settings in <tt>/etc/firewalld/</tt> are a range of preset settings
which can be quickly applied to a network interface. These are the zones
provided by firewalld sorted according to the default trust level of the
zones from untrusted to trusted:
<ul>
<li><tt>drop</tt><br /><p>Any incoming network packets are dropped, there is no
reply. Only outgoing network connections are possible.</p></li>
<li><tt>block</tt><br /><p>Any incoming network connections are rejected with an
<tt>icmp-host-prohibited</tt> message for IPv4 and <tt>icmp6-adm-prohibited</tt>
for IPv6. Only network connections initiated from within the system are
possible.</p></li>
<li><tt>public</tt><br /><p>For use in public areas. You do not trust the other
computers on the network to not harm your computer. Only selected incoming
connections are accepted.</p></li>
<li><tt>external</tt><br /><p>For use on external networks with masquerading enabled
especially for routers. You do not trust the other computers on the network to
not harm your computer. Only selected incoming connections are accepted.</p></li>
<li><tt>dmz</tt><br /><p>For computers in your demilitarized zone that are
publicly-accessible with limited access to your internal network. Only selected
incoming connections are accepted.</p></li>
<li><tt>work</tt><br /><p>For use in work areas. You mostly trust the other computers
on networks to not harm your computer. Only selected incoming connections are
accepted.</p></li>
<li><tt>home</tt><br /><p>For use in home areas. You mostly trust the other computers
on networks to not harm your computer. Only selected incoming connections are
accepted.</p></li>
<li><tt>internal</tt><br /><p>For use on internal networks. You mostly trust the
other computers on the networks to not harm your computer. Only selected
incoming connections are accepted.</p></li>
<li><tt>trusted</tt><br /><p>All network connections are accepted.</p></li>
</ul>
<br/>
It is possible to designate one of these zones to be the default zone. When
interface connections are added to <tt>NetworkManager</tt>, they are assigned
to the default zone. On installation, the default zone in firewalld is set to
be the public zone.
<br/>
To find out all the settings of a zone, for example the <tt>public zone,</tt>
enter the following command as root:
<pre># firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all</pre>
Example output of this command might look like the following:
<pre>
# firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all
public
  interfaces:
  services: mdns dhcpv6-client ssh
  ports:
  forward-ports:
  icmp-blocks: source-quench
</pre>
To view the network zones currently active, enter the following command as root:
<pre># firewall-cmd --get-service</pre>
The following listing displays the result of this command on common Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 7 Server system:
<pre>
# firewall-cmd --get-service
amanda-client bacula bacula-client dhcp dhcpv6 dhcpv6-client dns ftp
high-availability http https imaps ipp ipp-client ipsec kerberos kpasswd

pmcd pmproxy pmwebapi pmwebapis pop3s postgresql proxy-dhcp radius rpc-bind
samba samba-client smtp ssh telnet tftp tftp-client transmission-client
vnc-server wbem-https
</pre>
Finally to view the network zones that will be active after the next firewalld
service reload, enter the following command as root:
<pre># firewall-cmd --get-service --permanent</pre>

<title>Strengthen the Default Ruleset</title>
<description>The default rules can be strengthened. The system
scripts that activate the firewall rules expect them to be defined
in configuration files under the <tt>/etc/firewalld/services</tt>

<br /><br />
The following recommendations describe how to strengthen the
default ruleset configuration file. An alternative to editing this
configuration file is to create a shell script that makes calls to
the <tt>firewall-cmd</tt> program to load in rules under the <tt>/etc/firewalld/services</tt>

Instructions apply to both unless otherwise noted. Language and address

<title>Restrict ICMP Message Types</title>
<description>In <tt>/etc/sysconfig/iptables</tt>, the accepted ICMP messages
types can be restricted. To accept only ICMP echo reply, destination
unreachable, and time exceeded messages, remove the line:<br />
<pre>-A INPUT -p icmp -icmp-type any -j ACCEPT</pre>
and insert the lines:
<pre>-A INPUT -p icmp -icmp-type echo-reply -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -p icmp -icmp-type destination-unreachable -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -p icmp -icmp-type time-exceeded -j ACCEPT</pre>
To allow the system to respond to pings, also insert the following line:
<pre>-A INPUT -p icmp -icmp-type echo-request -j ACCEPT</pre>
Ping responses can also be limited to certain networks or hosts by using the -s
option in the previous rule.  Because IPv6 depends so heavily on ICMPv6, it is
preferable to deny the ICMPv6 packets you know you don't need (e.g. ping
requests) in <tt>/etc/sysconfig/ip6tables</tt>, while letting everything else
through:
<pre>-A INPUT -p icmpv6 -icmpv6-type echo-request -j DROP</pre>
If you are going to statically configure the machine's address, it should
ignore Router Advertisements which could add another IPv6 address to the
interface or alter important network settings:
<pre>-A INPUT -p icmpv6 -icmpv6-type router-advertisement -j DROP</pre>
Restricting ICMPv6 message types in <tt>/etc/sysconfig/ip6tables</tt> is not
recommended because the operation of IPv6 depends heavily on ICMPv6. Thus, great
care must be taken if any other ICMPv6 types are blocked.
</description>
<rationale>Restricting ICMP messages may make a system slightly less
discoverable to an unsophisticated attacker but is not appropriate for many
general-purpose use cases and can also make troubleshooting more difficult.

<Group id="firewalld_log_and_drop_suspicious">
<title>Log and Drop Packets with Suspicious Source Addresses</title>
<description>Packets with non-routable source addresses should be rejected, as they may indicate spoofing. Because the
modified policy will reject non-matching packets, you only need to add these rules if you are interested in also
logging these spoofing or suspicious attempts before they are dropped. If you do choose to log various suspicious
traffic, add identical rules with a target of <tt>DROP</tt> after each <i>LOG</i>.
To log and then drop these IPv4 packets, insert the following rules in <tt>/etc/sysconfig/iptables</tt> (excepting
any that are intentionally used):
<pre>-A INPUT -s 10.0.0.0/8 -j LOG -log-prefix "IP DROP SPOOF A: "
-A INPUT -s 172.16.0.0/12 -j LOG -log-prefix "IP DROP SPOOF B: "
-A INPUT -s 192.168.0.0/16 -j LOG -log-prefix "IP DROP SPOOF C: "
-A INPUT -s 224.0.0.0/4 -j LOG -log-prefix "IP DROP MULTICAST D: "
-A INPUT -s 240.0.0.0/5 -j LOG -log-prefix "IP DROP SPOOF E: "
-A INPUT -d 127.0.0.0/8 -j LOG -log-prefix "IP DROP LOOPBACK: "</pre>
Similarly, you might wish to log packets containing some IPv6 reserved addresses if they are not expected
on your network:
<pre>-A INPUT -i eth0 -s ::1 -j LOG -log-prefix "IPv6 DROP LOOPBACK: "
-A INPUT -s 2002:E000::/20 -j LOG -log-prefix "IPv6 6to4 TRAFFIC: "
-A INPUT -s 2002:7F00::/24 -j LOG -log-prefix "IPv6 6to4 TRAFFIC: "
-A INPUT -s 2002:0000::/24 -j LOG -log-prefix "IPv6 6to4 TRAFFIC: "
-A INPUT -s 2002:FF00::/24 -j LOG -log-prefix "IPv6 6to4 TRAFFIC: "
-A INPUT -s 2002:0A00::/24 -j LOG -log-prefix "IPv6 6to4 TRAFFIC: "
-A INPUT -s 2002:AC10::/28 -j LOG -log-prefix "IPv6 6to4 TRAFFIC: "
-A INPUT -s 2002:C0A8::/32 -j LOG -log-prefix "IPv6 6to4 TRAFFIC: "</pre>
If you are not expecting to see site-local multicast or auto-tunneled traffic, you can log those:
<pre>-A INPUT -s FF05::/16 -j LOG -log-prefix "IPv6 SITE-LOCAL MULTICAST: "
-A INPUT -s ::0.0.0.0/96 -j LOG -log-prefix "IPv4 COMPATIBLE IPv6 ADDR: "</pre>
If you wish to block multicasts to all link-local nodes (e.g. if you are not using router auto-configuration and
do not plan to have any services that multicast to the entire local network), you can block the link-local
all-nodes multicast address (before accepting incoming ICMPv6):
<pre>-A INPUT -d FF02::1 -j LOG -log-prefix "Link-local All-Nodes Multicast: "</pre>
However, if you're going to allow IPv4 compatible IPv6 addresses (of the form ::0.0.0.0/96), you should
then consider logging the non-routable IPv4-compatible addresses:
<pre>-A INPUT -s ::0.0.0.0/104 -j LOG -log-prefix "IP NON-ROUTABLE ADDR: "
-A INPUT -s ::127.0.0.0/104 -j LOG -log-prefix "IP DROP LOOPBACK: "
-A INPUT -s ::224.0.0.0.0/100 -j LOG -log-prefix "IP DROP MULTICAST D: "
-A INPUT -s ::255.0.0.0/104 -j LOG -log-prefix "IP BROADCAST: "</pre>
If you are not expecting to see any IPv4 (or IPv4-compatible) traffic on your network, consider logging it before it gets dropped:
<pre>-A INPUT -s ::FFFF:0.0.0.0/96 -j LOG -log-prefix "IPv4 MAPPED IPv6 ADDR: "
-A INPUT -s 2002::/16 -j LOG -log-prefix "IPv6 6to4 ADDR: "</pre>
The following rule will log all traffic originating from a site-local address, which is deprecated address space:
<pre>-A INPUT -s FEC0::/10 -j LOG -log-prefix "SITE-LOCAL ADDRESS TRAFFIC: "</pre>
