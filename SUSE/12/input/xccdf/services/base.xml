<title>Base Services</title>
<description>This section addresses the base services that are installed on a
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 default installation which are not covered in other
sections. Some of these services listen on the network and
should be treated with particular discretion. Other services are local
system utilities that may or may not be extraneous. In general, system services
should be disabled if not required.</description>
