# This file contains variables that are settings for OVAL checks such as 
# OVAL Schema version, i.e. 5.10, or the operating system version
# that the OVAL check currently supports, i.e. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.
#
# As OVAL checks support multiple operating system verions, the use of the
# multi_platform_ variables allow developers to easily specify the multiple
# operating system versions supported by a specific OVAL check. For example:
# 
#     <platform>Fedora 22</platform>
#     <platform>Fedora 23</platform>
#     <platform>Fedora 24</platform>
# 
# would be written in the OVAL check as:
#
#     <platform>multi_platform_fedora</platform>
#
# with the multi_platform_fedora variable set as the following in this file:
#
# multi_platform_fedora = 24,23,22
#
# Note: this file uses .ini style formatting
#

# OVAL Schema version
#
[Schema Version]
# The default OVAL content version for RHEL/7, Fedora, Debian/8 and
# OpenStack/RHEL-OSP/7 products is OVAL-5.10! (To support portion of the
# benchmark not using OVAL-5.11 language constructs successfully to build also
# with older oscap versions).
#
# But if during building the content we detect underlying oscap version on the
# system supports OVAL-5.11 language version already, we increase the produced
# OVAL document version to "5.11". See 'make checks' target in Makefiles for
# these products for further details.
