<title>Documentation to Support DISA OS SRG Mapping</title>
<description>These groups exist to document how the Red Hat Enterprise Linux
product meets (or does not meet) requirements listed in the DISA OS SRG, for
those cases where Groups or Rules elsewhere in scap-security-guide do
not clearly relate.

<Rule id="met_inherently_auditing">
<title>Product Meets this Requirement</title>
<rationale>
The Red Hat Enterprise Linux audit system meets this requirement through design and implementation.
</rationale>
<ocil>The RHEL8 auditing system supports this requirement and cannot be configured to be out of
compliance. Every audit record in RHEL includes a timestamp, the operation attempted,
success or failure of the operation, the subject involved (executable/process),
the object involved (file/path), and security labels for the subject and object.
It also includes the ability to label events with custom key labels.  The auditing system
centralizes the recording of audit events for the entire system and includes
reduction (<tt>ausearch</tt>), reporting (<tt>aureport</tt>), and real-time
response (<tt>audispd</tt>) facilities.
This is a permanent not a finding.

<Rule id="update_process">
<title>A process for prompt installation of OS updates must exist.</title>
<rationale>
This is a manual inquiry about update procedure.
</rationale>
<ocil>
Ask an administrator if a process exists to promptly and automatically apply OS
software updates.  If such a process does not exist, this is a finding.
<br /><br />
If the OS update process limits automatic updates of software packages, where
such updates would impede normal system operation, to scheduled maintenance
windows, but still within IAVM-dictated timeframes, this is not a finding.
</ocil>
<description>
Procedures to promptly apply software updates must be established and
executed. The Red Hat operating system provides support for automating such a
process, by running the yum program through a cron job or by managing the
system and its packages through the Red Hat Network or a Satellite Server.
