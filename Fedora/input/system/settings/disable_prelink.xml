<title>Prelinking Disabled</title>
<description>
The prelinking feature changes binaries in an attempt to decrease their startup
time. In order to disable it, change or add the following line inside the file
<tt>/etc/sysconfig/prelink</tt>:
<pre>PRELINKING=no</pre>
Next, run the following command to return binaries to a normal, non-prelinked
state:
<pre># /sbin/prelink -ua</pre>

<rationale>
The prelinking feature can interfere with the operation of checksum integrity
tools (e.g. AIDE), because it modifies binaries to speed up their startup time.
Also it makes the location of shared libraries very predictable, mitigating
the efficiency of address space layout randomization (ASLR) protection mechanism.
In addition, each upgrade of an application or a library requires prelink to be
run again.
