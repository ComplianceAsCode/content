<title>Software Integrity Checking</title>
<description>
Both the AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment)
software and the RPM package management system provide
mechanisms for verifying the integrity of installed software.
AIDE uses snapshots of file metadata (such as hashes) and compares these
to current system files in order to detect changes.
The RPM package management system can conduct integrity
checks by comparing information in its metadata database with
files installed on the system.
<br /><br />
Integrity checking cannot <i>prevent</i> intrusions,
but can detect that they have occurred. Requirements
for software integrity checking may be highly dependent on
the environment in which the system will be used. Snapshot-based
approaches such as AIDE may induce considerable overhead
in the presence of frequent software updates.

<title>Verify Integrity with AIDE</title>
<description>AIDE conducts integrity checks by comparing information about
files with previously-gathered information. Ideally, the AIDE database is
created immediately after initial system configuration, and then again after any
software update.  AIDE is highly configurable, with further configuration
information located in <tt>/usr/share/doc/aide-<i>VERSION</i></tt>.

<title>Disable Prelinking</title>
<description>
The prelinking feature changes binaries in an attempt to decrease their startup
time.  In order to disable it, change or add the following line inside the file
<tt>/etc/sysconfig/prelink</tt>:
<pre>PRELINKING=no</pre>
Next, run the following command to return binaries to a normal, non-prelinked state:
<pre>$ sudo /usr/sbin/prelink -ua</pre>

<description>Run the following command to generate a new database:

Storing the database, the configuration file <tt>/etc/aide.conf</tt>, and the binary

The newly-generated database can be installed as follows:

<title>Verify Integrity with RPM</title>
<description>The RPM package management system includes the ability
to verify the integrity of installed packages by comparing the
installed files with information about the files taken from the
package metadata stored in the RPM database. Although an attacker
could corrupt the RPM database (analogous to attacking the AIDE
database as described above), this check can still reveal
modification of important files. To list which files on the system differ from what is expected by the RPM database:
<pre># rpm -qVa</pre>

<title>Verify and Correct File Permissions with RPM</title>
<description>
The RPM package management system can check file access

After locating a file with incorrect permissions, run the following command to determine which package owns it:
<pre># rpm -qf <i>FILENAME</i></pre>
Next, run the following command to reset its permissions to 
the correct values:
<pre># rpm --setperms <i>PACKAGENAME</i></pre>

<title>Verify File Hashes with RPM</title>
<description>The RPM package management system can check the hashes of
installed software packages, including many that are important to system
security. Run the following command to list which files on the system
have hashes that differ from what is expected by the RPM database:
<pre># rpm -Va | grep '^..5'</pre>
A "c" in the second column indicates that a file is a configuration file, which
may appropriately be expected to change.  If the file was not expected to
change, investigate the cause of the change using audit logs or other means.
The package can then be reinstalled to restore the file.
Run the following command to determine which package owns the file:
<pre># rpm -qf <i>FILENAME</i></pre>
The package can be reinstalled from a dnf repository using the command:
<pre>dnf reinstall <i>PACKAGENAME</i></pre>
Alternatively, the package can be reinstalled from trusted media using the command:
<pre>rpm -Uvh <i>PACKAGENAME</i></pre>
