<title>Verify Permissions on Important Files and
Directories</title>
<description>Permissions for many files on a system must be set
restrictively to ensure sensitive information is properly protected.
This section discusses important
permission restrictions which can be verified
to ensure that no harmful discrepancies have
arisen.</description>

<title>Verify Permissions on Files with Local Account Information and Credentials</title>
<description>The default restrictive permissions for files which act as
important security databases such as <tt>passwd</tt>, <tt>shadow</tt>,
<tt>group</tt>, and <tt>gshadow</tt> files must be maintained.  Many utilities
need read access to the <tt>passwd</tt> file in order to function properly, but
read access to the <tt>shadow</tt> file allows malicious attacks against system
passwords, and should never be enabled.</description>

<Rule id="dir_perms_world_writable_sticky_bits">
<title>Verify that All World-Writable Directories Have Sticky Bits Set</title>
<description>When the so-called 'sticky bit' is set on a directory,
only the owner of a given file may remove that file from the
directory. Without the sticky bit, any user with write access to a
directory may remove any file in the directory. Setting the sticky
bit prevents users from removing each other's files. In cases where
there is no reason for a directory to be world-writable, a better
solution is to remove that permission rather than to set the sticky
bit. However, if a directory is used by a particular application,
consult that application's documentation instead of blindly
changing modes.
<br/>
To set the sticky bit on a world-writable directory <i>DIR</i>, run the
following command:
<pre>$ sudo chmod +t <i>DIR</i></pre>
</description>
<ocil clause="any world-writable directories are missing the sticky bit">
To find world-writable directories that lack the sticky bit, run the following command:

<rationale>
Failing to set the sticky bit on public directories allows unauthorized users to delete files in the directory structure.
<br/><br/>
The only authorized public directories are those temporary directories supplied with the system,
or those designed to be temporary file repositories.  The setting is normally reserved for directories
used by the system, by users for temporary file storage (such as <tt>/tmp</tt>), and for directories
requiring global read/write access.
