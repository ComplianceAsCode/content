<title>Base Services</title>
<description>
This section addresses the base services that are installed on a Wind River Linux 8 default installation which are not covered in other sections.
Some of these services listen on the network and should be treated with particular discretion.
Other services are local system utilities that may or may not be extraneous.
In general, system services should be disabled if not required.
