title: 'Least Privilege'

description: |-
    Grant the least privilege necessary for user accounts and software to perform tasks.
    For example, <tt>sudo</tt> can be implemented to limit authorization to super user
    accounts on the system only to designated personnel. Another example is to limit
    logins on server systems to only those administrators who need to log into them in
    order to perform administration tasks.
