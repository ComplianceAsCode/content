title: 'Run Different Network Services on Separate Systems'

description: |-
    Whenever possible, a server should be dedicated to serving exactly one
    network service. This limits the number of other services that can
    be compromised in the event that an attacker is able to successfully
    exploit a software flaw in one network service.
