title: 'Reboot Required'

description: |-
    A system or service reboot is implicitly required after some actions in order to
    complete the reconfiguration of the system. In many cases, the changes
    will not take effect until a reboot is performed. In order to ensure
    that changes are applied properly and to test functionality, always
    reboot the system after applying a set of recommendations from this guide.
