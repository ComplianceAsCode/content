title: 'Check-Dashboard-03: Is USE_SSL parameter set to True?'

description: |-
    Openstack services communicate with each other using various protocols and the communication might involve sensitive/confidential information. An attacker may try to eavesdrop on the channel in order to get access to sensitive information. Thus all the services must communicate with each other using a secured communication protocol like HTTPS.
    <br />
    <br />
    Pass: If value of parameter USE_SSL in /etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings is set to True.
    <br />
    <br />
    Fail: If value of parameter USE_SSL in /etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings is set to False.
