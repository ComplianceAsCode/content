title: 'Check-Dashboard-01: Is user/group of config files set to root/horizon?'

description: |-
    Configuration files contain critical parameters and information required for smooth functioning of the component. If an unprivileged user, either intentionally or accidentally modifies or deletes any of the parameters or the file itself then it would cause severe availability issues causing a denial of service to the other end users. Thus user ownership of such critical configuration files must be set to root and group ownership must be set to horizon.
    <br />
    <br />
    Run the following commands:

    <br />
    <tt>
    $ stat -L -c "%U %G"  /etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings | egrep "root horizon"
    </tt>
    <br />
    <br />
    Pass: If user and group ownership of the config file is set to root and horizon respectively. The above commands show output of root horizon.

    <br />
    <br />
    Fail: If the above commands does not return any output as the user and group ownership might have set to any user other than root or any group other than horizon.
