title: 'Check-Neutron-01: Is user/group ownership of config files set to root/neutron?'

description: |-
    Configuration files contain critical parameters and information required
    for smooth functioning of the component. If an unprivileged user, either
    intentionally or accidentally modifies or deletes any of the parameters
    or the file itself then it would cause severe availability issues causing
    a denial of service to the other end users. Thus user ownership of such
    critical configuration files must be set to root and group ownership
    must be set to neutron.
    <br />
    <br />
    Run the following commands:

    <pre>
    $ stat -L -c "%U %G" /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/neutron/etc/neutron/neutron.conf | egrep "root neutron"
    $ stat -L -c "%U %G" /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/neutron/etc/neutron/api-paste.ini | egrep "root neutron"
    $ stat -L -c "%U %G" /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/neutron/etc/neutron/policy.json | egrep "root neutron"
    $ stat -L -c "%U %G" /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/neutron/etc/neutron/rootwrap.conf | egrep "root neutron"
    </pre>

    Pass: If user and group ownership of all these config files is set to root and neutron respectively. The above commands show output of root neutron.
    <br />
    <br />

    Fail: If the above commands does not return any output as the user and group ownership might have set to any user other than root or any group other than neutron.
