title: 'Check-Dashboard-03: Is USE_SSL parameter set to True?'

description: |-
    Openstack services communicate with each other using various protocols and the
    communication might involve sensitive/confidential information. An attacker may
    try to eavesdrop on the channel in order to get access to sensitive information.
    Thus all the services must communicate with each other using a secured communication
    protocol like HTTPS.
    <br />
    <br />
    Pass: If value of parameter USE_SSL in
    /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/horizon/etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings is set to True.
    <br />
    <br />
    Fail: If value of parameter USE_SSL in
    /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/horizon/etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings is set to False.
