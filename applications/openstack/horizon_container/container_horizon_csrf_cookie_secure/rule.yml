title: 'Cross-Site Request Forgery Prevention: Enable CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE (containerized deployments)'

description: |-
    Usage of a secure cookie for the CSRF cookie is determined by the <tt>CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE</tt>
    parameter. When Red Hat OpenStack Platform is deployed as containerized services,
    this configuration setting is configured in the
    <tt>/var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/horizon/etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings</tt> file.

    The <tt>CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE</tt> option must be set to <tt>True</tt>:

    <pre>CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE True</pre>

    When <tt>CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE</tt> is set to <tt>True</tt>, the cookie will be marked
    as "secure," which means web browsers may ensure that the cookie is only sent
    with an HTTPS connection.

rationale: |-
    CSRF (Cross-site request forgery) is an attack which forces an end user
    to execute unauthorized commands on a web application in which he/she is
    currently authenticated. A successful CSRF exploit can compromise end
    user data and operations in case of normal user. If the targeted end
    user has admin privileges, this can compromise the entire web application.
