title: 'Set Maximum Number of Failed Authentication Attempts'

description: |-
     The account lockout feature limits the number of incorrect password
     attempts. If a user fails to authenticate after the maximum number
     of attempts, the service disables the user.
     <br />
     The maximum number of failed authentication attempts is set by the
     <tt>lockout_failure_attempts</tt> option in under the
     <tt>[security_compliance]</tt> section in <tt>keystone.conf</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Defining a maximum number of failed logon attempts can help
    mitigate brute force password attacks.

    Run the following command to see what the maximum authentication
    attempts is:
    <br />
    <pre>$ grep lockout_failure_attempts /etc/keystone/keystone.conf</pre>
    <br />
    If properly configured, the output should be:
    <pre>lockout_failure_attempts={{{ xccdf_value("var_keystone_lockout_failure_attempts") }}}</pre>
