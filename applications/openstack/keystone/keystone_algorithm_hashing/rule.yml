title: 'Check-Identity-04: Does Identity use strong hashing algorithms for PKI tokens?'

description: |-
    MD5 is a weak and depreciated hashing algorithm. It can be cracked using brute force attack. Identity tokens are sensitive and need to be protected with a stronger hashing algorithm to prevent unauthorized disclosure and subsequent access.

    <br />
    <br />
    Pass: If value of parameter hash_algorithm under [token] section in /etc/keystone/keystone.conf is set to SHA256.
    <br />
    <br />

    Fail: If value of parameter hash_algorithm under [token]section is set to MD5.
