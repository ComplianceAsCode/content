title: 'Check-Block-05: Does cinder communicates with nova over TLS?'

description: |-
    OpenStack components communicate with each other using various protocols and the communication might involve sensitive / confidential data. An attacker may try to eavesdrop on the channel in order to get access to sensitive information. Thus all the components must communicate with each other using a secured communication protocol.
