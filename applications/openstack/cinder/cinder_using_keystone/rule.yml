title: 'Check-Block-03: Is keystone used for authentication?'

description: |-
    OpenStack supports various authentication strategies like noauth, keystone etc. If the ‘noauth’ strategy is used then the users could interact with OpenStack services without any authentication. This could be a potential risk since an attacker might gain unauthorized access to the OpenStack components. Thus it is strongly recommended that all services must be authenticated with keystone using their service accounts.

    <br />
    <br />
    Pass: If value of parameter auth_strategy under [DEFAULT] section in /etc/cinder/cinder.conf is set to keystone.

    <br />
    <br />
    Fail: If value of parameter auth_strategy under [DEFAULT] section is set to noauth.
