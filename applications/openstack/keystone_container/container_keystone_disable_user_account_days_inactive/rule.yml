title: 'Set Maximum Inactivity Period'

description: |-
    Keystone can be configured to disable accounts after an
    organizationally-defined time period. This is achieved by configuring the
    <tt>disable_user_account_days_inactive</tt> setting in the
    <tt>[security_compliance]</tt> section in <tt>keystone.conf</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Automatically disabling accounts ensures that users who have not
    authenticated for an organizationally-defined time period are
    automatically disabled. This reduces the risk of stale accounts
    being used for malicious purposes.

    Run the following command to see what the maximum authentication
    attempts is:
    <br />
    <pre>$ grep disable_user_account_days_inactive /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/keystone/etc/keystone/keystone.conf</pre>
    <br />
    If properly configured, the output should be:
    <pre>disable_user_account_days_inactive = <sub idref="var_keystone_disable_user_account_days_inactive" /></pre>
