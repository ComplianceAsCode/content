title: 'Check-Identity-03: is SSL enabled for Identity?'

description: |-
    OpenStack components communicate with each other using various protocols and the
    communication might involve sensitive or confidential data. An attacker may try
    to eavesdrop on the channel in order to get access to sensitive information. Thus
    all the components must communicate with each other using a secured communication
    protocol like HTTPS.
    <br />
    <br />
