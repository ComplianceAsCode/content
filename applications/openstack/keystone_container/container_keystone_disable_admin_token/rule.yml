title: 'Check-Identity-06: Disable admin token in /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/keystone/etc/keystone/keystone.conf'

description: |-
    The admin token is generally used to bootstrap Identity. This token is the most valuable
    Identity asset, which could be used to gain cloud admin privileges.

    <br />
    <br />
    Pass: If admin_token under [DEFAULT] section in
    /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/keystone/etc/keystone/keystone.conf is
    disabled. And, AdminTokenAuthMiddleware under [filter:admin_token_auth] is
    deleted from /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/keystone/etc/keystone/keystone-paste.ini

    <br />
    <br />
    Fail: If admin_token under [DEFAULT] section is set and AdminTokenAuthMiddleware
    exists in keystone-paste.ini.
