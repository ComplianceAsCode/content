title: 'Set Account Lockout Duration'

description: |-
     Once a user account is locked out, such as exceeding the
     amount of logon attempts as defined by <tt>lockout_failure_attempts</tt>,
     Keystone will lockout an account for the time period defined by the
     <tt>lockout_duration</tt> configuration option unde the
     <tt>[security_compliance]</tt> section in <tt>keystone.conf</tt>.
     <br />
     Note that if <tt>lockout_failure_attempts</tt> is enabled and
     <tt>lockout_duration</tt> is left undefined, users will be
     locked out indefinitely until the user is explicitly re-enabled.

rationale: |-
     Defining a lockout duration helps mitigate certain attacks,
     such as brute force attempts. Additionally defining a lockout
     duration, versus indefinately locking an account, lowers
     administrative burden of re-enabling accounts of users
     who accidentally triggered the maximum failure attempts.

ocil: |-
    Run the following command to see what the account lockout
    duration is:
    <br />
    <pre>$ grep lockout_duration /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/keystone/etc/keystone/keystone.conf</pre>
    <br />
    If properly configured, the output should be:
    <pre>lockout_duration={{{ xccdf_value("var_keystone_lockout_failure_duration") }}}</pre>
