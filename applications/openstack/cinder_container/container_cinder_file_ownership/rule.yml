title: 'Check-Block-01: Is user/group ownership of config files set to root/cinder?'

description: |-
    Configuration files contain critical parameters and information required for 
    smooth functioning of the component. If an unprivileged user, either intentionally
    or accidentally, modifies or deletes any of the parameters or the file itself
    then it would cause severe availability issues resulting in a denial of service
    to the other end users. Thus user ownership of such critical configuration files
    must be set to <tt>root</tt> and group ownership must be set to <tt>cinder</tt>.
    <br />
    <br />
    Run the following commands:
    <br />
    <br />
    <tt>
    $ stat -L -c "%U %G" /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/cinder/etc/cinder/cinder.conf | egrep "root cinder"
    <br />
    $ stat -L -c "%U %G" /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/cinder/etc/cinder/api-paste.ini | egrep "root cinder"
    <br />
    $ stat -L -c "%U %G" /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/cinder/etc/cinder/policy.json | egrep "root cinder"
    <br />
    $ stat -L -c "%U %G" /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/cinder/etc/cinder/rootwrap.conf | egrep "root cinder"
    </tt>
    <br />
    <br />
    Pass: If user and group ownership of all these config files is set to root and
    cinder respectively. The above commands show output of root cinder.
    <br />
    <br />
    Fail: If the above commands does not return any output as the user and group
    ownership might have set to any user other than root or any group other than cinder.
