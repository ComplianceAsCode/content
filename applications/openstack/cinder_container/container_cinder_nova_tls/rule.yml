title: 'Check-Block-05: Does cinder communicates with nova over TLS?'

description: |-
    OpenStack components communicate with each other using various protocols and the communication
    might involve sensitive / confidential data. An attacker may try to eavesdrop on the
    channel in order to get access to sensitive information. Thus all the components
    must communicate with each other using a secured communication protocol.

    <br />
    <br />
    Pass: If value of parameter nova_api_insecure under [DEFAULT] section in /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/cinder/etc/cinder/cinder.conf is set to False.

    <br />
    <br />
    Fail: If value of parameter nova_api_insecure under [DEFAULT] section in /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/cinder/etc/cinder/cinder.conf is set to True.
