title: 'Check-Block-07: Is NAS operating in secure enviornment?'

description: |-
    Cinder supports an NFS driver which works differently than a traditional block storage driver.
    The NFS driver does not actually allow an instance to access a storage device at the block level.
    Instead, files are created on an NFS share and mapped to instances, which emulates a block device.
    Cinder supports secure configuration for such files by controlling the file permissions when cinder
    volumes are created. Cinder configuration can also control whether file operations are run as the
    root user or the current OpenStack process user.\n\n<br />\n<br />\n

    Pass: If value of parameter nas_secure_file_permissions under [DEFAULT] section
    in /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/cinder/etc/cinder/cinder.conf is set to <tt>auto</tt>.

    When set to auto, a check is done during cinder startup to determine if there are existing
    cinder volumes, no volumes will set the option to <tt>True</tt>, and use secure file permissions.
    The detection of existing volumes will set the option to <tt>False</tt>, and use the current
    insecure method of handling file permissions. If value of parameter nas_secure_file_operations
    under [DEFAULT] section in /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/cinder/etc/cinder/cinder.conf
    is set to auto. When set to &#8220;auto&#8221;, a check is done during cinder startup to determine
    if there are existing cinder volumes, no volumes will set the option to True, be secure and do
    NOT run as the root user. The detection of existing volumes will set the option to False, and
    use the current method of running operations as the root user. For new installations,
    a &#8220;marker file&#8221; is written so that subsequent restarts of cinder will know what 
    the original determination had been.\n\n<br />\n<br />\n

    Fail: If value of parameter nas_secure_file_permissions under [DEFAULT] section
    in /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/cinder/etc/cinder/cinder.conf is set to False
    and if value of parameter nas_secure_file_operations under [DEFAULT] section
    in /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/cinder/etc/cinder/cinder.conf is set to False."
