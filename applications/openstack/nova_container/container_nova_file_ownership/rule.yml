title: 'Check-Compute-01: Is user/group ownership of config files set to root/nova?'

description: |-
    Configuration files contain critical parameters and information required for
    smooth functioning of the component. If an unprivileged user, either intentionally
    or accidentally modifies or deletes any of the parameters or the file itself then
    it would cause severe availability issues causing a denial of service to the other
    end users. Thus user ownership of such critical configuration files must be set to
    root and group ownership must be set to nova.
    <br />
    <br />
    Run the following commands:

    <pre>
    $ stat -L -c "%U %G" /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/nova/etc/nova/nova.conf | egrep "root nova"
    $ stat -L -c "%U %G" /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/nova/etc/nova/api-paste.ini | egrep "root nova"
    $ stat -L -c "%U %G" /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/nova/etc/nova/policy.json | egrep "root nova"
    $ stat -L -c "%U %G" /var/lib/config-data/puppet-generated/nova/etc/nova/rootwrap.conf | egrep "root nova"
    </pre>
    <br />
    <br />
    Pass: If user and group ownership of all these config files is set to root and
    nova respectively. The above commands show output of root nova.
    <br />
    <br />

    Fail: If the above commands does not return any output as the user and group
    ownership might have set to any user other than root or any group other than nova.
