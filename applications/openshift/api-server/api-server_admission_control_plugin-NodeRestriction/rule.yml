title: 'Ensure that the admission control plugin NodeRestriction is set'

description: |-
    To limit the <tt>Node</tt> and <tt>Pod</tt> objects that a kubelet could
    modify, follow the OpenShift documentation and configure
    <tt>NodeRestriction</tt> plugin on kubelets. Then, edit the API Server pod
    specification file <tt>/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml</tt>
    on the master node(s) and set the <tt>--enable-admission-plugins</tt>
    parameter to a value that includes <tt>NodeRestriction</tt>:

    <pre>--enable-admission-plugins=...,NodeRestriction,...</pre>

rationale: |-
    Using the <tt>NodeRestriction</tt> plugin ensures that the kubelet is
    restricted to the <tt>Node</tt> and <tt>Pod</tt> objects that it could
    modify as defined. Such kubelets will only be allowed to modify their
    own <tt>Node</tt> API object, and only modify <tt>Pod</tt> API objects
    that are bound to their node.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: '<tt>--enable-admission-plugins</tt> arguments do not contain <tt>NodeRestriction</tt>'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver</pre>

    Verify that the <tt>--enable-admission-plugins</tt> argument is set,
    and that its value includes <tt>NodeRestriction</tt>.
