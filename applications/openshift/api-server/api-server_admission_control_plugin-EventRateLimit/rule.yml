title: 'Ensure that the admission control plugin EventRateLimit is set'

description: |-
    To limit the rate at which the API Server accepts requests, follow
    the OpenShift documentation and set the desired limits in a configuration
    file. Then, edit the API Server pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml</tt> and set the
    below parameters:

    <pre>--enable-admission-plugins=...,EventRateLimit,...
    --admission-control-config-file=<i>/path/to/configuration/file</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    Using <tt>EventRateLimit</tt> admission control enforces a limit on the
    number of events that the API Server will accept in a given time slice.
    In a large multi-tenant cluster, there might be a small percentage of
    misbehaving tenants which could have a significant impact on the
    performance of the cluster overall. It is recommended to limit the rate
    of events that the API Server will accept.

ocil_clause: '<tt>--enable-admission-plugins</tt> arguments do not include <tt>EventRateLimit</tt>'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver</pre>

    Verify that the <tt>--enable-admission-plugins</tt> argument is set to
    a value that includes <tt>EventRateLimit</tt>.
