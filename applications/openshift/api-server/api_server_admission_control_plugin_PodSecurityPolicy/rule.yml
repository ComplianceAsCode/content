title: 'Enable the PodSecurityPolicy Admission Control Plugin'

description: |-
    To reject pods that do not match Pod Security Policies, follow the
    OpenShift documentation and create Pod Security Policy objects as per your
    environment. Then, edit the API Server pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</tt> on the master node(s)
    and set the <tt>admissionConfig</tt> to include <tt>PodSecurityPolicy</tt>:
    <pre>admissionConfig:
      pluginConfig:
        PodSecurityPolicy:
          configuration:
          kind: DefaultAdmissionConfig
          apiVersion: v1
          disable: false</pre>

    Once configured, the API Server service will need to be restarted.

rationale: |-
    A Pod Security Policy is a cluster-level resource that controls the actions
    which a pod can perform and what the pod may access. The
    <tt>PodSecurityPolicy</tt> objects define a set of conditions that a pod
    must run with in order to be accepted into the system. Pod Security Policies
    are comprised of settings and strategies that control the security features
    a pod has access to and hence this must be used to control pod access
    permissions.

ocil_clause: '<tt>admissionConfig</tt> does not contain <tt>PodSecurityPolicy</tt>'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep -A4 PodSecurityPolicy /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</pre>
    The output should return <pre>disable: false</pre>.

warnings:
    - management: |-
        When the <tt>PodSecurityPolicy</tt> admission plugin is in use, there
        needs to be at least one <tt>PodSecurityPolicy</tt> in place for ANY pods to
        be admitted.
