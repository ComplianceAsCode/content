title: 'Enable the Secure Port for the API Server'

description: |-
    To ensure traffic is served over HTTPS, edit the API Server pod specification
    file <tt>/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</tt> on the master node(s)
    and either remove the <tt>secure-port</tt>  or set it to a different
    (non-zero) desired port.
    <pre>kubernetesMasterConfig:
      apiServerArguments:
        secure-port:
        - 8443</pre>

rationale: |-
    The secure port is used to serve HTTPS with authentication and authorization.
    If <tt>secure-port</tt> is disabled, as indicated with a value of <tt>0</tt>,
    HTTPS traffic will not be served and all traffic will be unencrypted.

severity: medium

references:
    cis: 1.1.7

ocil_clause: '<tt>secure-port</tt> is set with a value greater than <tt>0</tt>'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep -A2 secure-port /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</pre>
    The output should not return <pre>0</pre>.
