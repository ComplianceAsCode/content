title: 'Enable the APIPriorityAndFairness feature gate'

description: |-
  To limit the rate at which the API Server accepts requests, make
  sure that the API Priority and Fairness feature is enabled.
  Using <tt>APIPriorityAndFairness</tt> feature provides a fine-grained way
  to control the behaviour of the Kubernetes API server in an overload
  situation. To enable the <tt>APIPriorityAndFairness</tt> feature gate,
  make sure that the <tt>feature-gates</tt> API server argument, typically
  set in the <tt>config</tt> configMap in the <tt>openshift-kube-apiserver</tt>
  namespace contains <tt>APIPriorityAndFairness=true</tt>.
  Note that since Kubernetes 1.20, this feature gate is enabled by default.
  As a result, this rule is only applicable to OpenShift releases prior
  to 4.7 which was the first OCP release to ship Kubernetes 1.20.

rationale: |-
  The <tt>APIPriorityAndFairness</tt> feature gate enables the use of the
  <tt>FlowSchema</tt> API objects which enforce a limit on the number of
  events that the API Server will accept in a given time slice In a large
  multi-tenant cluster, there might be a small percentage of misbehaving
  tenants which could have a significant impact on the performance of
  the cluster overall. It is recommended to limit the rate of events
  that the API Server will accept.

  To verify that <tt>APIPriorityAndFairness</tt> is enabled, run the following command:
  <pre>oc get kubeapiservers.operator.openshift.io cluster -o json | jq '.spec.observedConfig.apiServerArguments["feature-gates"]'</pre>
  The output should contain "APIPriorityAndFairness=true"
