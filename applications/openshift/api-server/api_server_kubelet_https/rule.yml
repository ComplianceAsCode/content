title: 'Enable kubelet HTTPS connections to the API Server'

description: |-
    HTTPS should be used for connections between the API Server and Kubelets.

    Edit the API Server pod specification file <tt>/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</tt>
    on the master node(s) and remove the <tt>kubelet-https</tt> parameter. This will ensure communications
    are encrypted using TLS (the default setting).
    <pre>kubernetesMasterConfig:
      apiServerArguments:
        kubelet-https:
        - 'false'</pre>

rationale: |-
    Connections from the API Server to Kubelets could potentially carry
    sensitive data such as secrets and keys. It is important to use
    in-transit encryption for any communication between the API
    Server and the Kubelets.

ocil_clause: 'kubelet-https is specified it must be set to <tt>true</tt>'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep kubelet-https /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</pre>
    The output should return no output.
