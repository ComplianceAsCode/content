title: 'Ensure that the --audit-log-maxbackup argument is set to 10 or as appropriate'

description: |-
    'To configure how many rotations of audit logs are retained, edit the API Server
     pod specification file <tt>/etc/kubernetues/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml</tt>
     on the master node(s) and set the <tt>--audit-log-maxbackup</tt> parameter to
     <tt>10</tt> or to an organizationally appropriate value:

     <pre>--audit-log-maxbackup=10</pre>'

rationale: |-
     OpenShift automatically rotates the log files. Retaining old log files ensures
     OpenShift Operators will have sufficient log data available for carrying out
     any investigation or correlation. For example, if the audit log size is set to
     100 MB and the number of retained log files is set to 10, OpenShift Operators
     would have approximately 1 GB of log data to use during analysis.

ocil_clause: '<tt>--audit-log-maxbackup</tt> argument is set less than <tt>10</tt> or as appropriate'

ocil: |-
    'Run the following command on the master node(s):
     <pre>$ ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver</pre>

     Verify that the <tt>--audit-log-maxbackup</tt> argument is set,
     and contains a value of <tt>10</tt> or alternative as appropriate.
