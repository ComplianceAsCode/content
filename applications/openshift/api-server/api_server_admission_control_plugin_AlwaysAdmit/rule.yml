title: 'Disable the AlwaysAdmit Admission Control Plugin'

description: |-
    To ensure OpenShift only responses to requests explicitly allowed by the
    admissions control plugin, edit the API Server pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</tt> on the master node(s)
    and ensure the <tt>admissionConfig</tt> is not configured to include <tt>AlwaysAdmit</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Enabling the admission control plugin <tt>AlwaysAdmin</tt> allows all
    requests and does not provide any filtering.

severity: medium

references:
    cis: 1.1.10

ocil_clause: '<tt>admissionConfig</tt> is not set'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep -A4 AlwaysAdmit /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</pre>
    The output should return no output.
