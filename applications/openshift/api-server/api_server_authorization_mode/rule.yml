title: 'Disable use of AlwaysAllow for the API Server Authorization Mode'

description: |-
    The OpenShift API server should not allow anonymous API requests.
    To ensure that the API server requires authorization for API requests,
    validate that <tt>AlwaysAllow</tt> is not configured for <tt>authorization-mode</tt>
    in <tt>/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</tt>:
    <pre>kubernetesMasterConfig:
      apiServerArguments:
        authorization-mode:
        - AlwaysAllow</pre>

rationale: |-
    The <tt>AlwaysAllow</tt> authorization mode allows all requests including
    anonymous requests. This would grant any authenticated entity full cluster
    access.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: '<tt>authorization-mode</tt> is configured to use <tt>AlwaysAllow</tt>'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep -A1 authorization-mode /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</pre>
    Verify that the output does not contain <tt>AlwaysAllow</tt>.
