title: 'Ensure API Server authorization-mode is set to Webhook'

description: |-
    By default, unauthenticated/unauthorized users have no access to OpenShift nodes
    and the API Server <tt>authorization-mode</tt> is set to <tt>Webhook</tt>.
    To ensure that the API server requires authorization for API requests,
    validate that <tt>authorization-mode</tt> is configured to <tt>Webhook</tt>
    in <tt>/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</tt>:
    <pre>kubernetesMasterConfig:
      apiServerArguments:
        authorization-mode:
        - Webhook</pre>

warnings:
  - functionality: |-
      If <tt>authorization-mode</tt> is not configured to <tt>Webhook</tt>, the node
      systemd service (<tt>atomic-openshift-node</tt>) will not start.

rationale: |-
    Ensuring <tt>authorization-mode</tt> is set to <tt>Webhook</tt> helps enforce that
    unauthenticated/unauthorized users have no access to OpenShift nodes.
