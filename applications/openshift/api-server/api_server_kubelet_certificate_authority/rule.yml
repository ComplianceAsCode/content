title: 'Configure the kubelet Certificate Authority for the API Server'

description: |-
    To ensure OpenShift verifies kubelet certificates before establishing
    connections, follow the OpenShift documentation and setup the TLS connection
    between the API Server and kubelets. Then, verify
    that <tt>kubeletClientInfo</tt> has the <tt>ca</tt> configured in 
    the API Server pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</tt> on the master
    node(s) to something similar to:
    <pre>kubeletClientInfo:
      ca: ca-bundle.crt
      certFile: master.kubelet-client.crt
      keyFile: master.kubelet-client.key</pre>

rationale: |-
    Connections from the API Server to the kubelet are used for fetching logs
    for pods, attaching (through kubectl) to running pods, and using the kubelet
    port-forwarding functionality. These connections terminate at the kubelet
    HTTPS endpoint. By default, the API Server does not verify the kubelet serving
    certificate, which makes the connection subject to man-in-the-middle attacks,
    and unsafe to run over untrusted and/or public networks.

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep -A3 kubeletClientInfo /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</pre>
    The output should contain something similar to:
    <pre>kubeletClientInfo:
      ca: ca-bundle.crt
      certFile: master.kubelet-client.crt
      keyFile: master.kubelet-client.key</pre>
