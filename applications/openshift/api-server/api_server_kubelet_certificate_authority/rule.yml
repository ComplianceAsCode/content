title: 'Configure the kubelet Certificate Authority for the API Server'

description: |-
    To ensure OpenShift verifies kubelet certificates before establishing
    connections, follow the OpenShift documentation and setup the TLS connection
    between the API Server and kubelets.

{{%- if product == "ocp4" %}}
    Edit the <tt>openshift-kube-apiserver</tt> configmap on the master node(s)
    and set the below parameter if it is not already configured:
    <pre>
    "kubeletClientInfo":{
      ...
      "ca":"/etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/configmaps/kubelet-serving-ca/ca-bundle.crt",
      ...
    </pre>
{{% else %}}
    Ensure that <tt>kubeletClientInfo</tt> has the <tt>ca</tt> configured in
    the API Server pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</tt> on the master
    node(s) to something similar to:
    <pre>kubeletClientInfo:
      ca: ca-bundle.crt
      certFile: master.kubelet-client.crt
      keyFile: master.kubelet-client.key</pre>
{{%- endif %}}

rationale: |-
    Connections from the API Server to the kubelet are used for fetching logs
    for pods, attaching (through kubectl) to running pods, and using the kubelet
    port-forwarding functionality. These connections terminate at the kubelet
    HTTPS endpoint. By default, the API Server does not verify the kubelet serving
    certificate, which makes the connection subject to man-in-the-middle attacks,
    and unsafe to run over untrusted and/or public networks.

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
{{%- if product == "ocp4" %}}
    <pre>$ oc get configmap config -n openshift-kube-apiserver -ojson | jq -r '.data["config.yaml"]' | jq '.kubeletClientInfo["ca"]'</pre>
    The output should return a configured certificate.
{{% else %}}
    <pre>$ sudo grep -A3 kubeletClientInfo /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</pre>
    The output should contain something similar to:
    <pre>kubeletClientInfo:
      ca: ca-bundle.crt
      certFile: master.kubelet-client.crt
      keyFile: master.kubelet-client.key</pre>
{{%- endif %}}
