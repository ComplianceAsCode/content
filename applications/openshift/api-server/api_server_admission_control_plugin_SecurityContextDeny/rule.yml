title: 'Enable the SecurityContextDeny Admission Control Plugin'

description: |-
    Instead of using a customized SecurityContext for pods, a Pod Security
    Policy (PSP) should be used. PSP is a cluster-level resource that controls
    the actions that a pod can perform and what resource the pod may access.
    The <tt>SecurityContextDeny</tt> admission control policy enables PSP. To
    configure OpenShift to use PSP, edit the API Server pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</tt> on the master node(s) and
    set the <tt>admissionConfig</tt> to include <tt>SecurityContextDeny</tt>:
    <pre>admissionConfig:
      pluginConfig:
        SecurityContextDeny:
          configuration:
          kind: DefaultAdmissionConfig
          apiVersion: v1
          disable: false</pre>

rationale: |-
    Setting admission control policy to <tt>SecurityContextDeny</tt> denies the
    pod level SecurityContext customization. Any attempts to customize the
    SecurityContext that are not explicitly defined in the Pod Security Policy
    (PSP) are blocked. This ensures that all pods adhere to the PSP defined
    by your organization and you have a uniform pod level security posture.

    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep -A4 SecurityContextDeny /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</pre>
    The output should return <pre>disable: false</pre>.
