title: 'Disable Use of the Insecure Bind Address'

description: |-
    OpenShift should not bind to non-loopback insecure addresses. Edit the API
    Server pod specification file <tt>/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</tt>
    on the master node(s) and remove the <tt>insecure-bind-address</tt>
    parameter.
    <pre>kubernetesMasterConfig:
      apiServerArguments:
        insecure-bind-address:
        - 127.0.0.1</pre>

rationale: |-
    If the API Server is bound to an insecure address the installation would
    be susceptible to unauthented and unencrypted access to the master node(s).
    The API Server does not perform authentication checking for insecure
    binds and the traffic is generally not encrypted.

severity: medium

    cis: 1.2.18

ocil_clause: 'insecure-bind-address is specified and it must be set to <tt>127.0.01</tt>'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep -A2 insecure-bind-address /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</pre>
    The output should return <pre>127.0.01</pre>.
