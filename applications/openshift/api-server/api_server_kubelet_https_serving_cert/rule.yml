title: 'Enable kubelet HTTPS connections to the API Server'

description: |-
    By default, the OpenShift API Server runs in HTTPS mode. HTTPS should be
    used for connections between the API Server and Kubelets.
    Edit the <tt>openshift-kube-apiserver</tt> configmap on the master node(s)
    and remove the <tt>kubelet-https</tt> parameter if it is set to <tt>false</tt>:
    <pre>
    "apiServerArguments":{
      ...
      "kubelet-https":[
        "false"
      ],
      ...
    </pre>

rationale: |-
    Connections from the API Server to Kubelets could potentially carry
    sensitive data such as secrets and keys. It is important to use
    in-transit encryption for any communication between the API
    Server and the Kubelets.
