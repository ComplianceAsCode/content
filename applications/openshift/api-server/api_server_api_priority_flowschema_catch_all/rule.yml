title: 'Ensure catch-all FlowSchema object for API Priority and Fairness Exists'

description: |-
  Using <tt>APIPriorityAndFairness</tt> feature provides a fine-grained way
  to control the behaviour of the Kubernetes API server in an overload
  situation. The well-known FlowSchema <tt>catch-all</tt> should be available
  to make sure that every request gets some kind of classification. By default,
  the <tt>catch-all</tt> priority level only allows one concurrency share and
  does not queue requests. To inspect all the <tt>FlowSchema</tt> objects, run:
  <pre>oc get flowschema</pre>
  To inspect the well-known <tt>catch-all</tt> object, run the following:
  <pre>oc describe flowschema catch-all</pre>

rationale: |-
  The <tt>FlowSchema</tt> API objects enforce a limit on the
  number of events that the API Server will accept in a given time slice
  In a large multi-tenant cluster, there might be a small percentage of
  misbehaving tenants which could have a significant impact on the
  performance of the cluster overall. It is recommended to limit the rate
  of events that the API Server will accept.

  Run the following commands:
  <pre>oc get flowschema</pre>
  and inspect the FlowSchema objects. Make sure that at least the <tt>catch-all</tt>
