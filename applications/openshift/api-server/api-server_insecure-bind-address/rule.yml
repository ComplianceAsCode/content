title: 'Ensure that the --insecure-bind-address argument is not set'

description: |-
    OpenShift should not bind to non-loopback insecure addresses. Edit the API
    Server pod specification file <tt>/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml</tt>
    on the master node(s) and remove the <tt>--insecure-bind-address</tt>
    parameter.

rationale: |-
    If the API Server is bound to an insecure address the installation would
    be susceptible to unauthented and unencrypted access to the master node(s).
    The API Server does not perform authentication checking for insecure
    binds and the traffic is generally not encrypted.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: '<tt>--insecure-bind-address</tt> is specified it must be set to <tt>127.0.01</tt>'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver</pre>

    Verify that the <tt>--insecure-bind-address</tt> argument either does not exist or
    is set to <tt>127.0.0.1</tt>.
