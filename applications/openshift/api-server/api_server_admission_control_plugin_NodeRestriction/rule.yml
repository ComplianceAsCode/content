title: 'Ensure that the admission control plugin NodeRestriction is enabled'

description: |-
    To limit the <tt>Node</tt> and <tt>Pod</tt> objects that a kubelet could
    modify, follow the OpenShift documentation and configure
    <tt>NodeRestriction</tt> plugin on kubelets. Then, edit the API Server pod
    specification file <tt>/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</tt>
    on the master node(s) and set set the <tt>admissionConfig</tt> to include <tt>NodeRestriction</tt>:
    <pre>admissionConfig:
      pluginConfig:
        NodeRestriction:
          configuration:
          kind: DefaultAdmissionConfig
          apiVersion: v1
          disable: false</pre>

rationale: |-
    Using the <tt>NodeRestriction</tt> plugin ensures that the kubelet is
    restricted to the <tt>Node</tt> and <tt>Pod</tt> objects that it could
    modify as defined. Such kubelets will only be allowed to modify their
    own <tt>Node</tt> API object, and only modify <tt>Pod</tt> API objects
    that are bound to their node.

    Run the following command on the master node(s):

    The output should return <pre>disable: false</pre>.
