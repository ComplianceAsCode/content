title: 'Ensure that the --service-account-key-file argument is set as appropriate'

description: |-
    By default the <tt>--service-account-key-file</tt> argument is not set,
    which configures OpenShift to use the private key from the TLS serving
    certificate. To ensure the API Server utilizes its own key pair, edit the
    API Server pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml</tt> on the master node(s)
    and set the <tt>--service-account-key-file</tt> parameter to the public
    key file for service accounts:

    <pre>--service-account-key-file=<i>filename</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    By default, if no <tt>--service-account-key-file</tt> is specified to the
    API Server, the API Server uses the private key from the TLS serving
    certificate to verify service account tokens. To ensure that the keys
    for service account tokens could be rotated as needed, a separate
    public/private key pair should be used for signing service account
    tokens.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: '<tt>--service-acount-key-file</tt> argument is not set or does not refer to the API Server specific key'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver</pre>

    Verify that the <tt>--service-account-key-file</tt> argument exists
    and is set as appropriate.
