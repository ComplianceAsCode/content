title: 'Configure the Service Account Private Key for the API Server'

description: |-
    To ensure the API Server utilizes its own key pair, edit the
    API Server pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</tt> on the master node(s)
    and set the <tt>privateKeyFile</tt> parameter to the public
    key file for service accounts:
    <pre>serviceAccountConfig:
    ...
      privateKeyFile: serviceaccounts.private.key
    ...</pre>

rationale: |-
    By default, if no <tt>privateKeyFile</tt> is specified to the
    API Server, the API Server uses the private key from the TLS serving
    certificate to verify service account tokens. To ensure that the keys
    for service account tokens could be rotated as needed, a separate
    public/private key pair should be used for signing service account
    tokens.

ocil_clause: '<tt>privateKeyFile</tt> is not set as appropriate for <tt>serviceAccountConfig</tt>'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep -A9 serviceAccountConfig /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</pre>
    The output should contain a line similar to:
    <pre>privateKeyFile: serviceaccounts.private.key</pre>
