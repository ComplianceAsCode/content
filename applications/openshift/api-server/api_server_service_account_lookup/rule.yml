title: 'Enable service-account-lookup on the API Server'

description: |-
    To validate service accounts prior to validating tokens, edit the API
    Server pod specification file <tt>/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</tt>
    on the master node(s) and set <tt>service-account-lookup</tt> to <tt>true</tt>:
    <pre>kubernetesMasterConfig:
      apiServerArguments:
        service-account-lookup:
        - 'true'</pre>

rationale: |-
    By default, the API Server only verifies that the authentication token
    is valid. However, it does not validate that the service account token
    mentioned in the request is actually present in etcd. This allows using
    a service account token even after the corresponding service account is
    deleted. This is an example of <i>time of check to time of use</i>
    security issue.
