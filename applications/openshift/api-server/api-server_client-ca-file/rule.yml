title: 'Ensure that the --client-ca-file argument is set as appropriate'

description: |-
    Certificates must be provided to fully setup TLS client certificate
    authentication. Follow the OpenShift documentation and setup the TLS
    connection on the API Server. Then, edit the API Server pod specification
    file <tt>/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml</tt> on the master node(s)
    and set the client certificate authority file:

    <pre>--client-ca-file=<i>/path/to/client-ca-file</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    API Server communication contains sensitive parameters that should remain
    encrypted in transit. Configure the API Server to serve only HTTPS traffic.
    If <tt>--client-ca-file</tt> argument is set, any request presenting a client
    certificate signed by one of the authorities in the <tt>client-ca-file</tt>
    is authenticated with an identity corresponding to the <i>CommonName</i> of
    the client certificate.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: '<tt>--client-ca-file</tt> does not exist or is not set as appropriate'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver</pre>

    Verify that the <tt>--client-ca-file</tt> argument exists and is set
    as appropriate.
