title: 'Ensure that the --secure-port argument is not set to 0'

description: |-
    To ensure traffic is served over HTTPS, edit the API Server pod specification
    file <tt>/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml</tt> on the master node(s)
    and either remove the <tt>--secure-port</tt> parameter or set it to a different
    (non-zero) desired port.

rationale: |-
    The secure port is used to serve HTTPS with authentication and authorization.
    If <tt>--secure-port</tt> is disabled, as indicated with a value of <tt>0</tt>,
    HTTPS traffic will not be served and all traffic will be unencrypted.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: '<tt>--secure-port</tt> is set with a value greater than <tt>0</tt>'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver</pre>

    Verify that the <tt>--secure-port</tt> argument is either not set
    (reflecting default value of <tt>6443</tt>) or is set to an integer value
    between 1 and 65535.
