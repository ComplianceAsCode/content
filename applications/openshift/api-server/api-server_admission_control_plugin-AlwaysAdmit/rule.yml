title: 'Ensure that the admission control plugin AlwaysAdmit is not set'

description: |-
    To ensure OpenShift only responses to requests explicitly allowed by the
    admissions control plugin, edit the API Server pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml</tt> on the master node(s)
    and set the <tt>--enable-admission-plugin</tt> parameter to a value that
    does not include <tt>AlwaysAdmit</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Enabling the admission control plugin <tt>AlwaysAdmin</tt> allows all
    requests and does not provide any filtering.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: '<tt>--enable-admission-plugins</tt> is not set, or if <tt>--enable-admissions-plugins</tt> is configured and parameters contain <tt>AlwaysAdmit</tt>'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver</pre>

    Verify that the <tt>--enable-admission-plugins</tt> argument is set,
    and that its value does not include <tt>AlwaysAdmit</tt>.
