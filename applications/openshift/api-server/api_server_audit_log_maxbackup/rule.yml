title: 'Configure the Maximum Retained Audit Logs'

description: |-
    To configure how many rotations of audit logs are retained, edit the API Server
    pod specification file <tt>/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</tt>
    on the master node(s) and set the <tt>maximumRetainedFiles</tt> parameter to
    <tt>10</tt> or to an organizationally appropriate value:
    <pre>auditConfig:
      auditFilePath: "/etc/origin/master/audit-ocp.log"
      enabled: true
      maximumFileRetentionDays: 30
      maximumFileSizeMegabytes: 10
      maximumRetainedFiles: 10</pre>

rationale: |-
    OpenShift automatically rotates the log files. Retaining old log files ensures
    OpenShift Operators will have sufficient log data available for carrying out
    any investigation or correlation. For example, if the audit log size is set to
    100 MB and the number of retained log files is set to 10, OpenShift Operators
    would have approximately 1 GB of log data to use during analysis.

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep maximumRetainedFiles /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</pre>
    The output should return a value of <pre>10</pre> or as appropriate.
