title: 'Disable Anonymous Authentication to the API Server'

description: |-
    By default, anonymous access to the OpenShift API is enabled. This
    configuration check ensures that anonymous requests to the OpenShift
    API server are disabled.

    Verify the <tt>openshift-kube-apiserver</tt> configmap on the master node(s)
    has set the below parameter:
    <pre>
    "apiServerArguments":{
      ...
      "anonymous-auth":[
        "false"
      ],
      ...
    </pre>

rationale: |-
    When enabled, requests that are not rejected by other configured
    authentication methods are treated as anonymous requests. These
    requests are then served by the API server. OpenShift Operators should
    rely on authentication to authorize access and disallow anonymous
    requests as it allows an attacker to discover information about
    the system and/or network in use.

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ oc get configmap config -n openshift-kube-apiserver -ojson | jq -r '.data["config.yaml"]' | jq '.apiServerArguments["anonymous-auth"]'</pre>
    The output should return <pre>false</pre>.
