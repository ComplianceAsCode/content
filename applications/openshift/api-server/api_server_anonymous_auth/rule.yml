title: 'Disable Anonymous Authentication to the API Server'

description: |-
    By default, anonymous access to the OpenShift API is enabled. This
    configuration check ensures that anonymous requests to the OpenShift
    API server are disabled. Edit the API server pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</tt> on the master node(s)
    and set the below parameter:
    <pre>apiServerArguments:
      anonymous-auth:
      - 'false'</pre>

rationale: |-
    When enabled, requests that are not rejected by other configured
    authentication methods are treated as anonymous requests. These
    requests are then served by the API server. OpenShift Operators should
    rely on authentication to authorize access and disallow anonymous
    requests.

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep -A1 anonymous-auth /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</pre>
    The output should return <pre>false</pre>.
