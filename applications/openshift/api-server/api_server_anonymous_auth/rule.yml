title: 'Ensure that anonymous requests to the API Server are authorized'

description: |-
    By default, anonymous access to the OpenShift API is enabled, but at
    the same time, all requests must be authorized. If no authentication
    mechanism is used, the request is assigned the <tt>system:anonymous</tt>
    virtual user and the <tt>system:unauthenticated</tt> virtual group.
    This allows the authorization layer to determin which requests, if any,
    is an anonymous user authorized to make.

    To verify the authorization rules for anonymous requests run the following:
    <pre>$ oc describe clusterrolebindings</pre>
    and inspect the bidnings of the <tt>system:anonymous</tt>
    virtual user and the <tt>system:unauthenticated</tt> virtual group.

    To test that an anonymous request is authorized to access the <tt>readyz</tt>
    endpoint, run:
    <pre>$ oc get --as="system:anonymous" --raw='/readyz?verbose'</pre>
    In contrast, a request to list all projects should not be authorized:
    <pre>$ oc get --as="system:anonymous" projects</pre>

rationale: |-
    When enabled, requests that are not rejected by other configured
    authentication methods are treated as anonymous requests. These requests
    are then served by the API server. If you are using RBAC authorization,
    it is generally considered reasonable to allow anonymous access to the
    API Server for health checks and discovery purposes, and hence this
    recommendation is not scored. However, you should consider whether
    anonymous discovery is an acceptable risk for your purposes.

    Run the following command to view the authorization rules for anonymous requests:
    <pre>$ oc describe clusterrolebindings</pre>
    Make sure that there exists at least one <tt>clusterrolebinding</tt> that binds
    either the <tt>system:unauthenticated</tt> group or the <tt>system:anonymous</tt>
    user.
    To test that an anonymous request is authorized to access the <tt>readyz</tt>
