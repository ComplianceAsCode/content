title: 'Ensure that the --audit-log-maxsize argument is set to 100 or as appropriate'

description: |-
    To rotate audit logs upon reaching a maximum size, edit the API Server pod
    specification file <tt>/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml</tt> on
    the master node(s) and set the <tt>--audit-log-maxsize</tt> parameter to
    an appropriate size in MB. For example, to set it to 100 MB:

    <pre>--audit-log-maxsize=100MB</pre>

rationale: |-
    OpenShift automatically rotates log files. Retaining old log files ensures that
    OpenShift Operators have sufficient log data available for carrying out any
    investigation or correlation. If you have set file size of 100 MB and the number of
    old log files to keep as 10, there would be approximately 1 GB of log data
    available for use in analysis.

ocil_clause: '<tt>--audit-log-maxsize</tt> argument is set less than <tt>100</tt> or as appropriate'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver</pre>

    Verify that the <tt>--audit-log-maxsize</tt> argument is set,
    and contains a value of <tt>100</tt> or alternative as appropriate.
