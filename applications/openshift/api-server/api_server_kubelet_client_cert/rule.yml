title: 'Configure the kubelet Certificate File for the API Server'

description: |-
    To enable certificate based kubelet authentication, follow the OpenShift
    documentation and setup the TLS connection between the API Server and
    kubelets. Then, verify
    that <tt>kubeletClientInfo</tt> has the <tt>certFile</tt> configured in 
    the API Server pod specification file
{{%- if product == "ocp4" %}}
    <tt>/etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/configmaps/config/config.yaml</tt> on the master
    node(s) to something similar to:
    <pre>
    "kubeletClientInfo":{
      ...
      "certFile":"/etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/secrets/kubelet-client/tls.crt",
      ...
    </pre>
{{% else %}}
    <tt>/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</tt> on the master
    node(s) to something similar to:
    <pre>kubeletClientInfo:
      ca: ca-bundle.crt
      certFile: master.kubelet-client.crt
      keyFile: master.kubelet-client.key</pre>
{{%- endif %}}

rationale: |-
    By default the API Server does not authenticate itself to the kublet's
    HTTPS endpoints. Requests from the API Server are treated anonymously.
    Configuring certificate-based kubelet authentication ensures that the
    API Server authenticates itself to kubelets when submitting requests.

    Run the following command on the master node(s):
{{%- if product == "ocp4" %}}
    <pre>$ sudo grep -A3 kubeletClientInfo /etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/configmaps/config/config.yaml</pre>
    The output should contain something similar to:
    <pre>"certFile":"/etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/secrets/kubelet-client/tls.crt",</pre>
{{% else %}}
    <pre>$ sudo grep -A3 kubeletClientInfo /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</pre>
    The output should contain something similar to:
    <pre>kubeletClientInfo:
      ca: ca-bundle.crt
      certFile: master.kubelet-client.crt
      keyFile: master.kubelet-client.key</pre>
