title: 'Enable the AlwaysPullImages Admission Control Plugin'

description: |-
    To ensure credentials are required to pull images, edit the API Server pod
    specification file
    <tt>/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</tt> on the master node(s) and
    set the <tt>admissionConfig</tt> to include <tt>AlwaysPullImages</tt>:
    <pre>admissionConfig:
      pluginConfig:
        AlwaysPullImages:
          configuration:
          kind: DefaultAdmissionConfig
          apiVersion: v1
          disable: false</pre>

rationale: |-
    Setting admission control policy to include <tt>AlwaysPullImages</tt> forces
    every new pod to pull the required images during every build. In a multi-tenant
    cluster users can be assured that private images can only be used by those who
    have the credentials to pull them. Without this admission control policy, once
    an image has been pulled to a node, any pod from any user can use it simply by
    knowing the image's name (without any authorization check against the image
    access control lists). When this plugin is enabled, images are always pulled
    prior to starting containers and forces authorization.

ocil_clause: '<tt>admissionConfig</tt> does not contain <tt>AlwaysPullImages</tt>'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep -A4 AlwaysPullImages /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</pre>
    The output should return <pre>disable: false</pre>.
