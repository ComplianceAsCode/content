title: 'Ensure that the Admission Control Plugin AlwaysPullImages is not set'

description: |-
     The <tt>AlwaysPullImages</tt> admission control plugin should be disabled,
     since it can introduce new failure modes for control plane components if an
     image registry is unreachable.

rationale: |-
     Setting admission control policy to AlwaysPullImages forces every new pod
     to pull the required images every time. In a multi-tenant cluster users can
     be assured that their private images can only be used by those who have the
     credentials to pull them. Without this admission control policy, once an
     image has been pulled to a node, any pod from any user can use it simply by
     knowing the imageâ€™s name, without any authorization check against the image
     ownership. When this plug-in is enabled, images are always pulled prior to
     starting containers, which means valid credentials are required.

     However, turning on this admission plugin can introduce new kinds of
     cluster failure modes. OpenShift 4 master and infrastructure components are
     deployed as pods. Enabling this feature can result in cases where loss of
     contact to an image registry can cause a redeployed infrastructure pod
     (oauth-server for example) to fail on an image pull for an image that is
     currently present on the node. We use PullIfNotPresent so that a loss of
     image registry access does not prevent the pod from starting.  If it
     becomes PullAlways, then an image registry access outage can cause key
     infrastructure components to fail.

     The pull policy can be managed per container, using
     <tt>imagePullPolicy</tt>.
