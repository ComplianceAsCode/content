description: |-
    <p>
    When you enable etcd encryption, the following OpenShift API server
    and Kubernetes API server resources are encrypted:
    <ul>
      <li>Secrets</li>
      <li>ConfigMaps</li>
      <li>Routes</li>
      <li>OAuth access tokens</li>
      <li>OAuth authorize tokens</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    When you enable etcd encryption, encryption keys are created. These
    keys are rotated on a weekly basis. You must have these keys in order
    to restore from an etcd backup.
    </p>
    <p>
    To ensure the correct cipher, set the encryption type <tt>aescbc</tt> in the
    <tt>apiserver</tt> object which configures the API server itself.
    <pre>
    spec:
      encryption:
        type: aescbc
    </pre>
    </p>
    <p>

rationale: |-
    etcd is a highly available key-value store used by OpenShift deployments
    for persistent storage of all REST API objects. These objects are
    sensitive in nature and should be encrypted at rest to avoid any
    disclosures. Where etcd encryption is used, it is important to ensure that the
    appropriate set of encryption providers is used. Currently, <tt>aescbc</tt>
    is the only type supported by OCP.

ocil_clause: '<tt>aescbc</tt> is not configured as the encryption provider'

ocil: |-
    OpenShift supports encryption of data at rest of etcd datastore, but it is up to the
    customer to configure. The asecbc cipher is used. No other ciphers are supported. Keys
    are stored on the filesystem of the master and automatically rotated.
    Run the following command to review the Encrypted status condition for the OpenShift
    API server to verify that its resources were successfully encrypted:
    <pre>
    # encrypt the etcd datastore
    $ oc get openshiftapiserver -o=jsonpath='{range.items[0].status.conditions[?(@.type=="Encrypted")]}{.reason}{"\n"}{.message}{"\n"}'
    <pre>
    The output shows <tt>EncryptionCompleted</tt> upon successful encryption.
    If the output shows <tt>EncryptionInProgress</tt> this means that encryption is still in
    progress. Wait a few minutes and try again.
    To display the encryption configured, run the following command:
    <pre>$ oc get --raw {{.var_apiserver_encryption_path}} | jq {{.var_apiserver_encryption_filter}} </pre>
    If the output does not list <tt>aescbc</tt>, the encryption is not configured correctly.
