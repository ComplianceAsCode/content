title: 'Ensure that the API Server only makes use of Strong Cryptographic Ciphers'

description: |-
    To ensure that the API Server is configured to only use strong
    cryptographic ciphers, edit the API Server pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml</tt> on the master
    node and set the parameter below:

    <pre>--tls-cipher-suites=TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256</pre>

rationale: |-
     TLS ciphers have had a number of known vulnerabilities and weaknesses,
     which can reduce the protection provided. By default OpenShift supports
     a number of TLS ciphersuites including some that have security concerns,
     weakening the protection provided.

     NOTE: Once configured, API Server clients that cannot support modern
     cryptographic ciphers will not be able to make connections to the API
     server.

ocil_clause: '<tt>--tls-cipher-suites</tt> does not contain TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver</pre>

    Verify that the <tt>--tls-cipher-suites</tt> argument is set as outlined.
