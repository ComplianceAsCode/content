title: 'Enable Advanced Auditing for the API Server'

description: |-
    To ensure advanced auditing is not disabled, edit the API
    server pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</tt> and set the
    parameters below:
    <pre>kubernetesMasterConfig:
      apiServerArguments:
        feature-gates:
        - AdvancedAuditing=true</pre>

rationale: |-
    <tt>AdvancedAuditing</tt> enables a much more general API auditing
    pipeline, which includes support for pluggable output backends and an
    audit policy specifying how different requests should be audited.
    Additionally, this enables auditing of failed authentication,
    authorization, and login attempts which could prove crucial for
    protecting your production clusters. It is recommended not to disable
    advanced auditing.
