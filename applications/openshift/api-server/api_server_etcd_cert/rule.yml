title: 'Ensure that the --etcd-certfile and --etcd-keyfile arguments are set as appropriate'

description: |-
    To ensure etcd is configured to make use of TLS encryption for client
    communications, follow the OpenShift documentation and setup the TLS
    connection between the API Server and etcd. Then, edit the API Server
    pod specificiation file
    <tt>/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</tt> on the master
    node(s) and set the etcd certificate and key file parameters:

    <pre>--etcd-certfile=<i>/path/to/client-certificate-file</i>
    --etcd-keyfile=<i>/path/to/client-key-file</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    etcd is a highly-available key-value store used by OpenShift deployments
    for persistent storage of all REST API objects. These objects are sensitive
    in nature and should be protected by client authentication. This requires the
    API Server to identify itself to the etcd server using a client certificate
    and key.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: '<tt>--etcd-certfile</tt> and <tt>--etcd-keyfile</tt> do not exist or are not configured to valid certificates'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver</pre>

    Verify that the <tt>--etcd-certfile</tt> and <tt>--etcd-keyfile</tt>
    arguments exist and they are set as appropriate.
