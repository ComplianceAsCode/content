title: 'Configure the etcd Certificate for the API Server'

description: |-
    To ensure etcd is configured to make use of TLS encryption for client
    communications, follow the OpenShift documentation and setup the TLS
    connection between the API Server and etcd. Then, verify
{{%- if product == "ocp4" %}}
    that <tt>storageConfig</tt> has the <tt>certFile</tt> configured in 
    the API Server pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/configmaps/config/config.yaml</tt> on the master
    node(s) to something similar to:
    <pre>
    "storageConfig":{
      ...
      "certFile":"/etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/secrets/etcd-client/tls.crt",
      ...
    </pre>
{{% else %}}
    that <tt>etcdClientInfo</tt> has the <tt>ca</tt> configured in 
    the API Server pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</tt> on the master
    node(s) to something similar to:
    <pre>etcdClientInfo:
      ca: master.etcd-ca.crt
      certFile: master.etcd-client.crt
      keyFile: master.etcd-client.key</pre>
{{%- endif %}}

rationale: |-
    etcd is a highly-available key-value store used by OpenShift deployments
    for persistent storage of all REST API objects. These objects are sensitive
    in nature and should be protected by client authentication. This requires the
    API Server to identify itself to the etcd server using a client certificate
    and key.

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
{{%- if product == "ocp4" %}}
    <pre>$ sudo grep certFile /etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/configmaps/config/config.yaml</pre>
    The output should contain something similar to:
    <pre>"certFile":"/etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/secrets/etcd-client/tls.crt",</pre>
{{% else %}}
    <pre>$ sudo grep -A3 etcdClientInfo /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</pre>
    The output should contain something similar to:
    <pre>etcdClientInfo:
      ca: master.etcd-ca.crt
      certFile: master.etcd-client.crt
      keyFile: master.etcd-client.key</pre>
