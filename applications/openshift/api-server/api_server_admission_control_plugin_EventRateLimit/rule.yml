title: 'Enable the EventRateLimit Admission Control Plugin'

description: |-
    To limit the rate at which the API Server accepts requests, follow
    the OpenShift documentation and set the desired limits in a configuration
    file. Then, edit the API Server pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</tt> and
    set the <tt>admissionConfig</tt> to include <tt>DenyEscalatingExec</tt>:
    <pre>admissionConfig:
      pluginConfig:
        EventRateLimit:
          configuration:
          kind: DefaultAdmissionConfig
          apiVersion: v1
          disable: false</pre>

rationale: |-
    Using <tt>EventRateLimit</tt> admission control enforces a limit on the
    number of events that the API Server will accept in a given time slice.
    In a large multi-tenant cluster, there might be a small percentage of
    misbehaving tenants which could have a significant impact on the
    performance of the cluster overall. It is recommended to limit the rate
    of events that the API Server will accept.
