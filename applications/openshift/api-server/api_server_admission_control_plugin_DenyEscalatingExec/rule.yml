title: 'Enable the DenyEscalatingExec Admission Control Plugin'

description: |-
    By default, <tt>DenyEscalatingExec</tt> is not enabled, which allows
    privileged pods to execute <tt>exec</tt> and <tt>attach</tt> commands.
    To disable this capability, edit the API Server pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</tt> on the master node(s) and
    set the <tt>admissionConfig</tt> to include <tt>DenyEscalatingExec</tt>:
    <pre>admissionConfig:
      pluginConfig:
        DenyEscalatingExec:
          configuration:
          kind: DefaultAdmissionConfig
          apiVersion: v1
          disable: false</pre>

rationale: |-
    Setting admission control policy to include <tt>DenyEscalatingExec</tt>
    denies <tt>exec</tt> and <tt>attach</tt> commands to pods that run with
    escalated privileges that allow host access. This includes pods that run as
    privileged, have access to the host IPC namespace, and have access to the host
    PID namespace.

ocil_clause: '<tt>admissionConfig</tt> does not contain <tt>DenyEscalatingExec</tt>'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep -A4 DenyEscalatingExec /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</pre>
    The output should return <pre>disable: false</pre>.
