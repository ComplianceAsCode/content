title: 'Ensure that the --basic-auth-file argument is not set'

description: |-
   Basic Authentication should not be used. Follow the OpenShift documentation
   and configure alternate mechanisms for authentication. Then, edit API
   server pod specification file <tt>/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml</tt>
   on the master node and remove the <tt>--basic-auth-file=<i>filename</i></tt> parameter.

   Alternate authentication mechanisms such as tokens and certificates will need to be
   used. Username and password for basic authentication will be disabled.

rationale: |-
   Basic authentication uses plaintext credentials for authentication.
   Currently the basic authentication credentials last indefinitely, and
   the password cannot be changed without restarting the API Server. The
   Basic Authentication is currently supported for convenience and is
   not intended for production workloads.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: '<tt>--basic-auth-file</tt> is enabled'

ocil: |-
   Run the following command on the master node(s):
   <pre>$ ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver</pre>

   Verify that the <tt>--basic-auth-file</tt> argument does not exist.
