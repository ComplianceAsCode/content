title: 'Disable basic-auth-file for the API Server'

description: |-
    Basic Authentication should not be used. Follow the OpenShift documentation
    and configure alternate mechanisms for authentication. Then, edit API
    server pod specification file <tt>/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</tt>
    on the master node and remove the <tt>basic-auth-file</tt> parameter.
    <pre>kubernetesMasterConfig:
      apiServerArguments:
        basic-auth-file:
        - /path/to/any/file</pre>

    Alternate authentication mechanisms such as tokens and certificates will need to be
    used. Username and password for basic authentication will be disabled.

rationale: |-
    Basic authentication uses plaintext credentials for authentication.
    Currently the basic authentication credentials last indefinitely, and
    the password cannot be changed without restarting the API Server. The
    Basic Authentication is currently supported for convenience and is
    not intended for production workloads.
