title: 'Ensure the openshift-oauth-apiserver service uses TLS'

description: |-
    By default, the OpenShift API Server uses TLS. HTTPS should be
    used for connections between openshift-apiserver and kube-apiserver.
    OpenShift API server enables TLS automatically if a TLS key and a
    certificate are provided via the <tt>serving-cert</tt> secret
    in the <tt>openshift-apiserver</tt> namespace.

rationale: |-
    Connections between the kube-apiserver and the extension
    openshift-apiserver could potentially carry sensitive data such
    as secrets and keys. It is important to use in-transit encryption
    for any communication between the kube-apiserver and the extension
    openshift-apiserver.

ocil_clause: |-
    The openshift-apiserver serving-cert is not set to type
    <tt>kubernetes.io/tls</tt> and that returned Data does not include <tt>tls.crt</tt>
    and <tt>tls.key</tt>

ocil: |-
    Run the following command:
    <pre>$ oc -n openshift-apiserver describe secret serving-cert</pre>
    Verify that the <tt>serving-cert</tt> for the openshift-apiserver is type
    <tt>kubernetes.io/tls</tt> and that returned Data includes <tt>tls.crt</tt>
    and <tt>tls.key</tt>.

# (jhrozek): Disabled because the compliance operator does not have the permissions
#            to read secrets from openshift-apiserver
#            - checking for the type should be enough as the type enforces the required
#              keys
