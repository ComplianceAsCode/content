title: 'Profiling is protected by RBAC'

description: |-
  Ensure that the cluster-debugger cluster role includes the /metrics
  resource URL. This demonstrates that profiling is protected by RBAC, with a
  specific cluster role to allow access.

rationale: |-
  Profiling allows for the identification of specific performance bottlenecks.
  It generates a significant amount of program data that could potentially be
  exploited to uncover system and program details.
  To ensure the collected data is not exploited, profiling endpoints are secured
  via RBAC (see cluster-debugger role). By default, the profiling endpoints are
  accessible only by users bound to cluster-admin or cluster-debugger role.
  Profiling can not be disabled.

    To verify that the <tt>cluster-debugger</tt> role is configured correctly,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ oc get clusterroles cluster-debugger -o jsonpath='{.rules[0].nonResourceURLs}'</pre>
    and verify that the <tt>/metrics</tt> path is included there.
