title: 'Profiling is protected by RBAC'

description: |-
    Ensure that profiling is protected by RBAC by verifying the
    cluster-debugger cluster role includes the `/metrics` resource URL. This
    demonstrates that profiling access is properly secured with specific
    cluster role permissions.

rationale: |-
    Profiling allows for the identification of specific performance bottlenecks
    but generates a significant amount of program data that could potentially
    be exploited to uncover system and program details. To ensure the collected
    data is not exploited, profiling endpoints are secured via RBAC using the
    cluster-debugger role. By default, profiling endpoints are accessible only
    by users bound to cluster-admin or cluster-debugger roles. Unsecured
    profiling endpoints could expose sensitive system information to
    unauthorized users.

    The `cluster-debugger` role isn't protecting `/metrics`

ocil: |-
    Verify that the `cluster-debugger` role is configured correctly by running
    the following command:

    ```
    $ oc get clusterroles cluster-debugger -o jsonpath='{.rules[0].nonResourceURLs}'
    ```

    Verify that the `/metrics` path is included in the output.
