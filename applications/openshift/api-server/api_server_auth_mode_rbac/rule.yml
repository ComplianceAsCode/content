title: Ensure authorization-mode RBAC is configured

description: |-
  To ensure OpenShift restricts different identities to a defined set
  of operations they are allowed to perform, check that the API server's
  <tt>authorization-mode</tt> configuration option list containst RBAC.

rationale: |-
  Role Based Access Control (RBAC) allows fine-grained control over the
  operations that different entities can perform on different objects in
  the cluster. Enabling RBAC is critical in regulating access to an
  OpenShift cluster as the RBAC rules specify, given a user, which operations
  can be executed over a set of namespaced or cluster-wide resources.

ocil: |-
    To verify that RBAC authorization mode is enabled, run the following command:
    <pre>$ oc get configmap config -n openshift-kube-apiserver -ojson | jq -r '.data["config.yaml"]' | grep '"authorization-mode":\[[^]]*"RBAC"'</pre>
    The output should show that the "authorization-mode" list contains the "RBAC" authorizer.
