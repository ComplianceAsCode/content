title: 'Configure the Encryption Provider Cipher'

description: |-
    To configure OpenShift to use the <tt>aescbc</tt> encryption provider,
    follow the OpenShift documentation to create or modify an
    <tt>EncryptionConfig</tt> file at <tt>/etc/origin/master/encryption-config.yaml</tt>.
    In this file, choose <tt>aescbc</tt> as the encryption provider:
    <pre>kind: EncryptionConfig
    apiVersion: v1
    resources:
      - resources:
        - secrets
        providers:
        - aescbc:
            keys:
            - name: key1
              secret: <i>32-byte base64-encoded secret</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    <tt>aescbc</tt> is currently the strongest encryption provider, it should
    be preferred over other providers.

    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep -A4 aescbc /etc/origin/master/encryption-config.yaml</pre>
    Verify that the <tt>aescbc</tt> encryption provider is used for all the desired
    <tt>resources</tt>.
