title: 'Configure the Certificate Key for the API Server'

description: |-
    To ensure the API Server utilizes its own TLS certificates, the
    <tt>keyFile</tt> must be configured. To, verify
    that <tt>servingInfo</tt> has the <tt>keyFile</tt> configured in 
    the API Server pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</tt> on the master
    node(s) to something similar to:
    <pre>servingInfo:
      clientCA: ca.crt
      certFile: master.server.crt
      keyFile: master.server.key</pre>

rationale: |-
    API Server communication contains sensitive parameters that should remain
    encrypted in transit. Configure the API Server to serve only HTTPS
    traffic.

ocil_clause: '<tt>keyFile</tt> is not set as appropriate for <tt>servingInfo</tt>'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep -A7 servingInfo /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</pre>
    The output should contain something similar to:
    <pre>servingInfo:
      clientCA: ca.crt
      certFile: master.server.crt
      keyFile: master.server.key</pre>
