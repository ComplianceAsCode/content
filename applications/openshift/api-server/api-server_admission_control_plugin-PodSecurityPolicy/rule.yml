title: 'Ensure that the admission control plugin PodSecurityPolicy is set'

description: |-
    To reject pods that do not match Pod Security Policies, follow the
    OpenShift documentation and create Pod Security Policy objects as per your
    environment. Then, edit the API Server pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml</tt> on the master node(s)
    and set <tt>--enable-admission-plugins</tt> parameter to a value that includes
    <tt>PodSecurityPolicy</tt>:

    <pre>--enable-admission-plugins=...,PodSecurityPolicy,...</pre>

    Once configured, the API Server service will need to be restarted.

rationale: |-
    A Pod Security Policy is a cluster-level resource that controls the actions
    which a pod can perform and what the pod may access. The
    <tt>PodSecurityPolicy</tt> objects define a set of conditions that a pod
    must run with in order to be accepted into the system. Pod Security Policies
    are comprised of settings and strategies that control the security features
    a pod has access to and hence this must be used to control pod access
    permissions.

    NOTE: When the <tt>PodSecurityPolicy</tt> admission plugin is in use, there
    needs to be at least one <tt>PodSecurityPolicy</tt> in place for ANY pods to
    be admitted.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: '<tt>--enable-admission-plugins</tt> arguments do not contain <tt>PodSecurityPolicy</tt>'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver</pre>

    Verify that the <tt>--enable-admission-plugins</tt> argument is set,
    and that its value includes <tt>PodSecurityPolicy</tt>.
