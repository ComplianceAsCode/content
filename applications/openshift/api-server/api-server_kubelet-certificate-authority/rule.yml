title: 'Ensure that the --kubelet-certificate-authority argument is set as appropriate'

description: |-
    To ensure OpenShift verifies kubelet certificates before establishing
    connections, follow the OpenShift documentation and setup the TLS connection
    between the API Server and kubelets. Then, edit the API server pod specification
    file <tt>/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml</tt> on the master node(s)
    and set the <tt>--kubelet-certificate-authority</tt> parameter to the path
    of the cert file for the certificate authority. For example:

    <pre>--kubelet-certificate-authority=<i>ca-string</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    Connections from the API Server to the kubelet are used for fetching logs
    for pods, attaching (through kubectl) to running pods, and using the kubelet
    port-forwarding functionality. These connections terminate at the kubelet
    HTTPS endpoint. By default, teh API Server does not verify the kubelet serving
    certificate, which makes the connection subject to man-in-the-middle attacks,
    and unsafe to run over untrusted and/or public networks.

severity: high

ocil_clause: '<tt>--kubelet-certificate-authority</tt> argument does not exist or is not set appropriately'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver</pre>

    Verify that the <tt>--kubelet-certificate-authority</tt> argument
    is set to a valid path.
