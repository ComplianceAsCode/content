title: 'Ensure that the --audit-log-maxage argument is set to 30 or as appropriate'

description: |-
    To configure audit log retention, edit the API Server pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml</tt> on the master node(s) and set
    the <tt>--audit-log-maxage</tt> parameter to 30 or as appropriate number of days:

    <pre>--audit-log-maxage=30</pre>

rationale: |-
    Retaining audit logs for a specified period of time allows OpenShift Operators
    to retroactively review and correlate events, such as for investigative purposes.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: '<tt>--audit-log-maxage</tt> argument is set less than <tt>30</tt> or as appropriate'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver</pre>

    Verify that the <tt>--audit-log-maxage</tt> argument is set,
    and contains a value of <tt>30</tt> or alternative as appropriate.
