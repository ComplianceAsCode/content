description: |-
    'To configure OpenShift to use the <tt>aescbc</tt> encryption provider,
    follow the OpenShift documentation and configure a
    <tt>EncryptionConfig</tt> file. In this file, choose <tt>aescbc</tt>
    as the encryption provider:

    <pre>
    kind: EncryptionConfig
    apiVersion: v1
    resources:
      - resources:
        - secrets
        providers:
        - aescbc:
            keys:
            - name: key1
              secret: <i>32-byte base64-encoded secret</i>
    </pre>'

rationale: |-
    <tt>aescbc</tt> is currently the strongest encryption provider, it should
    be preferred over other providers.

    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver</pre>

    Get the <tt>EncryptionConfig</tt> file set for
    <tt>--experimental-encryption-provider-config</tt> argument. Verify that
    the <tt>aescbc</tt> encryption provider is used for all the desired
    <tt>resources</tt>.
