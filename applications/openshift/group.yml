title: 'Kubernetes Settings'

description: |-
    Each section of this configuration guide includes information about the
    configuration of a Kubernetes cluster and a set of recommendations for
    hardening the configuration. For each hardening recommendation, information
    on how to implement the control and/or how to verify or audit the control
    is provided. In some cases, remediation information is also provided.

    Some of the settings in the hardening guide are in place by default. The
    audit information for these settings is provided in order to verify that
    the cluster admininstrator has not made changes that would be less secure.
    A small number of items require configuration.

    Finally, there are some recommendations that require decisions by the
    system operator, such as audit log size, retention, and related settings.
