title: 'OpenShift Settings'

description: |-
    Each section of this configuration guide includes information about the default configuration
    of an OpenShift cluster and a set of recommendations for hardening the configuration. For each
    hardening recommendation, information on how to implement the control and/or how to verify or audit
    the control is provided. In some cases, remediation information is also provided.

    Many of the settings in the hardening guide are in place by default. The audit information for these
    settings is provided in order to verify that the cluster admininstrator has not made changes that
    would be less secure than the OpenShift defaults. A small number of items require configuration.

    Finally, there are some recommendations that require decisions by the system operator, such as audit
    log size, retention, and related settings.
