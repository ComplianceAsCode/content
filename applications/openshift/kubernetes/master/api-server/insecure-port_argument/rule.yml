title: 'Ensure that the --insecure-port argument is set to 0'

description: |-
    'All components that use the API should connect via the secured port,
    authenticate themselves, and be authorized to use the API. To ensure
    such a configuration, edit the API Server pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml</tt> on the master
    node(s) and set the <tt>--insecure-port</tt> argument to <tt>0</tt>:

    <pre>--insecure-port=0</pre>'

rationale: |-
    Configuring the API Server on an insecure port would allow unauthenticated
    and unencrypted access to your master node(s). It is assumed firewall rules
    will be configured to ensure this port is not reachable from outside
    the cluster, however as a defense in depth measure, OpenShift should not
    be configured to use insecure ports.

    'Run the following command on the master node(s):
     <pre>ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver</pre>

     Verify that the <tt>--insecure-port</tt> argument is set to <tt>0</tt>.'
