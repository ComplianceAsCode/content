title: 'Ensure that the --etcd-cafile argument is set as appropriate'

description: |-
    'To ensure etcd is configured to make use of TLS encryption for client
    connections, follow the OpenShift documentation and setup the TLS
    connection between the API Server and etcd. Then, edit the API Server
    pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml</tt> on the master
    node(s) and set the etcd <tt>--etcd-cafile</tt> parameter:

    <pre>--etcd-cafile=<path/to/ca-file></pre>'

rationale: |-
    etcd is a highly-available key-value store used by OpenShift deployments
    for persistent storage of all REST API objects. These objects are
    sensitive in nature and should be protected by client authentication. This
    requires the API Server to identify itself to the etcd server using
    a SSL Certificate Authority file.

    as appropriate.'
