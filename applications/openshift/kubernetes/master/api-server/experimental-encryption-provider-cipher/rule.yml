    'To configure OpenShift to use the <tt>aescbc</tt> encryption provider,
    follow the OpenShift documentation and configure a
    <tt>EncryptionConfig</tt> file. In this file, choose <tt>aescbc</tt>
    as the encryption provider:

    <pre>
kind: EncryptionConfig
apiVersion: v1
resources:
  - resources:
    - secrets
    providers:
    - aescbc:
        keys:
        - name: key1
          secret: <32-byte base64-encoded secret>
</pre>'

    <tt>aescbc</tt> is currently the strongest encryption provider, it should
    be preferred over other providers.
