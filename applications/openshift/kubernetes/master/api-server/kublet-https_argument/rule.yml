title: 'Ensure that the --kubelet-https argument is set to true'

description: |-
    'HTTPS should be used for connections between the API Server and Kubelets.

    Edit the API Server pod specification file <tt>/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml</tt>
    on the master node(s) and remove the <tt>--kubelet-https</tt> parameter. This will ensure communications
    are encrypted using TLS (the default setting).'

rationale: |-
    Connections from the API Server to Kubelets could potentially carry
    sensitive data such as secrets and keys. It is important to use
    in-transit encryption for any communication between the API
    Server and the Kubelets.

ocil_clause: '<tt>--kubelet-https</tt> is specified it must be set to <tt>true</tt>'

ocil: |-
    'Run the following command on the master node(s):
     <pre><tt>ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver</tt></pre>

     Verify that the <tt>--kubelet-https</tt> argument either does not exist or
     is set to <tt>true</tt>.'
