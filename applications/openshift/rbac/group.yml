title: 'Role-based Acess Control'

description: |-
    Role-based access control (RBAC) objects determine
    whether a user is allowed to perform a given action
    within a project.

    Cluster administrators can use the cluster roles and
    bindings to control who has various access levels to
    the OpenShift Container Platform platform itself
    and all projects.

    Developers can use local roles and bindings to control
    who has access to their projects. Note that authorization
    is a separate step from authentication, which is more
    about determining the identity of who is taking the action.
