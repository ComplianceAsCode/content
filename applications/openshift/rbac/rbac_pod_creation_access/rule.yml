title: 'Minimize Access to Pod Creation'

description: |-
    The ability to create pods in a namespace can provide a
    number of opportunities for privilege escalation. Where
    applicable, remove <tt>create</tt> access to <tt>pod</tt>
    objects in the cluster.

rationale: |-
    The ability to create pods in a cluster opens up the cluster
    for privilege escalation.

ocil_clause: 'pod creation privileges are in use by more roles than necessary'

ocil: |-
    To review the pod creation privileges in roles, run the following commands:
    <pre>$ oc get roles --all-namespaces -o yaml</pre>
    <pre>$ oc get clusterroles -o yaml</pre>
    Review the output and ensure that pod creation privileged use is limited to
    as small subset as possible.
