title: 'Minimize Access to Pod Creation'

description: |-
    The ability to create pods in a namespace can provide a
    number of opportunities for privilege escalation. Where
    applicable, remove <tt>create</tt> access to <tt>pod</tt>
    objects in the cluster.

rationale: |-
    The ability to create pods in a cluster opens up the cluster
    for privilege escalation.

ocil_clause: 'pod creation privileges in roles needs review'

ocil: |-
    To review the pod creation privileges in roles, run the following commands:
    <pre>$ oc describe roles --all-namespaces</pre>
    <pre>$ oc describe clusterroles</pre>
    Review the output, and for any role/clusterrole defining create permissions
    for pods that are NOT an OpenShift "system:" or other system-provided
    role/clusterrole, determine if the users bound to the role truly have the
    need to create pods.
