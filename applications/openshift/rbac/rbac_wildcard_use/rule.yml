title: 'Minimize Wildcard Usage in Cluster and Local Roles'

description: |-
    Kubernetes Cluster and Local Roles provide access to resources
    based on sets of objects and actions that can be taken on
    those objects. It is possible to set either of these using a
    wildcard <tt>*</tt> which matches all items. This violates the
    principle of least privilege and leaves a cluster in a more
    vulnerable state to privilege abuse.

rationale: |-
    The principle of least privilege recommends that users are
    provided only the access required for their role and nothing
    more. The use of wildcard rights grants is likely to provide
    excessive rights to the Kubernetes API.

ocil_clause: 'wildcard usage in roles needs review'

ocil: |-
    To review the wildcard usage in roles, run the following commands:
    <pre>$ oc describe roles --all-namespaces</pre>
    <pre>$ oc describe clusterroles</pre>
    Review the output, and for any role/clusterrole specifying a wildcard
    resource that is NOT an OpenShift "system:" or other system-provided
    role/clusterrole, determine if the wildcard access can be replaced with
    specific resources.
