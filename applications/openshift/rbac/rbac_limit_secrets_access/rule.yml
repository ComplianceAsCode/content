title: 'Limit Access to Kubernetes Secrets'

description: |-
    The Kubernetes API stores secrets, which may be service
    account tokens for the Kubernetes API or credentials used
    by workloads in the cluster. Access to these secrets should
    be restricted to the smallest possible group of users to
    reduce the risk of privilege escalation. To restict users from
    secrets, remove <tt>get</tt>, <tt>list</tt>, and <tt>watch</tt>
    access to unauthorized users to secret objects in the cluster.

rationale: |-
    Inappropriate access to secrets stored within the Kubernetes
    cluster can allow for an attacker to gain additional access to
    the Kubernetes cluster or external resources whose credentials
    are stored as secrets.

    To review the policy rules assigned to roles in all namespaces, run
    the following command:
    <pre>$ for ns in $(oc get projects -ojsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}'); do oc describe roles -n$ns; done</pre>
    To review the policy rules assigned to cluster roles, run the following
    command:
    <pre>$ for i in $(oc get clusterroles -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}'); do oc describe clusterrole ${i}; done</pre>
    Review the output and ensure that only authorized roles have access to the
    secrets resource or all resources using a wildcard.
    To filter clusterroles that have assigned access to the secrets resources for clustrroles, run:
    <pre>$ oc get clusterroles -ojson | jq -r '.items[] | {name: .metadata.name, rules: .rules} | select(.rules[]?.resources | try contains(["secrets"])) | .name' | sort | uniq</pre>
    and similarly to filter namespace/role pairs:
    <pre>$ for ns in $(oc get projects -ojsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name}'); do oc get roles -n$ns -ojson | jq -r '.items[] | {name: .metadata.name, namespace: .metadata.namespace, rules: .rules} | select(.rules[]?.resources | try contains(["secrets"])) | "\(.namespace)/\(.name)"' | sort | uniq; done</pre>
    note that the two commands above do not show roles and/or clusterroles with wildcard access to any resources.
