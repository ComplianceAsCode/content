title: 'Limit Access to Kubernetes Secrets'

description: |-
    The Kubernetes API stores secrets, which may be service
    account tokens for the Kubernetes API or credentials used
    by workloads in the cluster. Access to these secrets should
    be restricted to the smallest possible group of users to
    reduce the risk of privilege escalation. To restict users from
    secrets, remove <tt>get</tt>, <tt>list</tt>, and <tt>watch</tt>
    access to unauthorized users to secret objects in the cluster.

rationale: |-
    Inappropriate access to secrets stored within the Kubernetes
    cluster can allow for an attacker to gain additional access to
    the Kubernetes cluster or external resources whose credentials
    are stored as secrets.
