title: 'Ensure that the ClusterLogging and ClusterLogingForwarder resources are protected from unauthorized modification'

description: |-
    The ClusterLogging and ClusterLogingForwarder Custom Resources provide 
    a way to configure the logging forwarding subsystem and modification access to it
    should be restricted to as-needed basis.

    {{{ fix_openshift_logging_rbac("edit") | indent(4) }}}}

rationale: |-
    Protecting audit data also includes identifying and protecting the tools used to view and
    manipulate log data. Therefore, protecting audit tools is necessary to prevent unauthorized
    operation on audit data.
