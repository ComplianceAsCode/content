title: 'Ensure that the RBAC setup follows the principle of least privilege'

description: |-
    Role-based access control (RBAC) objects determine whether a user is
    allowed to perform a given action within a project.

    {{{ fix_openshift_rbac_least_privilege() | indent(4) }}}

rationale: |-
    Controlling and limiting users access to system services and resources
    is key to securing the platform and limiting the intentional or
    unintentional comprimising of the system and its services.  OpenShift
    provides a robust RBAC policy system that allows for authorization
    policies to be as detailed as needed. Additionally there are two layers
    of RBAC policies, the first is Cluster RBAC policies which administrators
    can control who has what access to cluster level services. The other is
    Local RBAC policies, which allow project developers/administrators to
    control what level of access users have to a given project or namespace.
