title: 'Restrict Automounting of Service Account Tokens'

description: |-
    Restrict automatic mounting of service account tokens in pods. Configure
    pods to only mount service account tokens when the workload explicitly
    needs to communicate with the API server. Set
    `automountServiceAccountToken` to `false` to prevent automatic token
    mounting.

rationale: |-
    Mounting service account tokens inside pods creates an attack vector for
    privilege escalation. Attackers who compromise a single pod can use the
    mounted token to access the Kubernetes API and potentially escalate
    privileges within the cluster. Restricting token mounting reduces the
    attack surface and limits the potential impact of pod compromises.

ocil_clause: 'service account token usage needs review'

ocil: |-
    Review each pod specification in the cluster to verify that pods not
    requiring API server communication have `automountServiceAccountToken`
    configured to `false`. Examine pod manifests and deployment configurations
    to ensure proper token restriction.
