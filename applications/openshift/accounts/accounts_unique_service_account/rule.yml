title: 'Ensure Usage of Unique Service Accounts '

description: |-
    Using the <tt>default</tt> service account prevents accurate application
    rights review and audit tracing. For each namespace, create
    a new and unique service account with the following command:
    <pre>$ oc create sa <i>service_account_name></i></pre>
    where <i>service_account_name></i> is the name of a service account
    that is needed in the project namespace.

rationale: |-
    Kubernetes provides a default service account which is used by
    cluster workloads where no specific service account is assigned to the pod.
    Where access to the Kubernetes API from a pod is required, a specific service account
    should be created for that pod, and rights granted to that service account.
    This increases auditability of service account rights and access making it
    easier and more accurate to trace potential malicious behaviors to a specific
    service account and project.

ocil_clause: 'default service account is used and is not unique'

ocil: |-
    For each namespace in the cluster, review the rights assigned
    to the default service account. There should be no cluster or local roles
    assigned to the default other than the defaults.
