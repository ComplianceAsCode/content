title: 'Ensure Usage of Unique Service Accounts '

description: |-
    Ensure applications use unique service accounts instead of the `default`
    service account to enable accurate rights review and audit tracing.
    Create dedicated service accounts for each application that requires
    Kubernetes API access. Use the following command to create a unique
    service account:
    ```
    oc create sa service_account_name
    ```
    Replace `service_account_name` with a descriptive name for the service
    account needed in the project namespace.

rationale: |-
    Kubernetes provides a default service account that cluster workloads use
    when no specific service account is assigned to the pod. Configure specific
    service accounts for pods that require access to the Kubernetes API and
    grant rights to those dedicated accounts. This approach increases
    auditability of service account rights and access, making it easier to
    trace potential malicious behaviors to specific service accounts and
    projects. Using the `default` service account creates security risks
    through overly broad permissions and inadequate audit trails.

ocil_clause: 'default service account usage needs review'

ocil: |-
    Review the rights assigned to the `default` service account in each
    namespace. Verify that no cluster roles or local roles are assigned to
    the `default` service account beyond the system defaults. Examine
    RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings to ensure compliance.
