title: 'Use Dedicated Service Accounts'

description: |-
    Configure Kubernetes workloads to use dedicated service accounts instead
    of cluster node service accounts for Amazon EKS API authentication.
    Provision each Kubernetes workload that requires AWS service authentication
    with a dedicated service account linked to appropriate AWS IAM roles.

rationale: |-
    Manual authentication approaches for Kubernetes workloads on Amazon EKS
    create security risks. Storing service account keys as Kubernetes secrets
    introduces manual key rotation requirements and potential key compromise.
    Using underlying node IAM service accounts violates the principle of least
    privilege in multi-tenant environments, where one pod requires service
    access but other pods on the same node do not. Dedicated service accounts
    provide proper isolation and minimize security risks through appropriate
    permission boundaries.

ocil: |-
    Review each namespace to verify that the `default` service account has no
    roles or cluster roles bound to it beyond system defaults. Verify that
    `automountServiceAccountToken: false` is configured for each `default`
    service account. Configure IAM roles for service accounts on Amazon EKS
    clusters to associate IAM roles with Kubernetes service accounts, enabling
    AWS API access without extended worker node permissions. Reference the AWS
    documentation for implementation guidance on IAM roles for service
    accounts.
