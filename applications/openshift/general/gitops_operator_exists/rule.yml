title: Ensure that GitOps Operator is deployed

description: |-
  Red Hat OpenShift GitOps is a declarative continuous delivery platform based on
  Argo CD. It enables teams to adopt GitOps principles for managing cluster configurations
  and automating secure and repeatable application delivery across hybrid multi-cluster
  Kubernetes environments. 
  
  Following GitOps and infrastructure as code principles, you can store the configuration of
  clusters and applications in Git repositories and use Git workflows to roll them out to
  the target clusters.


rationale: |-
  GitOps provides a mean to track system configuration changes
