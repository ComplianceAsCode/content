title: 'Ensure Pods use Least Privileged Security Context Constraints (SCC)'

description: |-
    Security Context Constraints (SCC) control what actions pods can perform and what resources
    they can access. SCCs combine a set of security configurations into a single policy object
    that can be applied to pods. These security configurations include, but are not limited to,
    Linux Capabilities, Seccomp profiles, User and Group ID Ranges, and types of mounts.

    OpenShift ships with several SCCs. The most constrained is the <tt>restricted</tt> SCC, and the
    least constrained is the <tt>privileged</tt> SCC. The others provide intermediate levels of
    constraint for various use cases. The <tt>restricted</tt> SCC is granted to all authenticated
    users by default.

    If required, a cluster administrator may allow certain pods to run with different SCCs. As
    a general principal pods should always be ran with the most restrictive SCC possible.

    Pods inherit their SCC from the Service Account used to run the pod. With the default project
    template, new projects receive a Service Account named <tt>default</tt> that is used to run pods. This
    default service account is only granted the ability to run the <tt>restricted</tt> SCC.

rationale: |-
    Ensure Pods are ran with the least privileges possible.

    To show all available SCCs:
    <pre>$ oc describe scc</pre>

    To audit a single pod:
    <pre>$ oc describe <i>POD</i> | grep openshift.io\/scc</pre>

    Ensure each Pod on the system is configured to use the least privilege SCC possible.
