title: 'The default namespace should not be used'

description: |-
   Kubernetes provides a default namespace, where objects are placed if no
   namespace is specified for them. Placing objects in this namespace makes
   application of RBAC and other controls more difficult.

rationale: |-
   Resources in a Kubernetes cluster should be segregated by namespace, to allow
   for security controls to be applied at that level and to make it easier to
   manage resources.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: 'Use of the default namespace needs review'

ocil: |-
   Run the following command to list objects in the default namespace:
   <pre>$ oc get all -n default</pre>
   The only entries there should be system-managed resources such as the
   <tt>kubernetes</tt> and <tt>openshift</tt> service.
