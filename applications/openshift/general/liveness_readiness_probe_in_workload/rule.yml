title: Ensure that all workloads have liveness and readiness probes

description: |-
  Configuring Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes is essential for ensuring the security and 
  reliability of a system. These probes actively monitor container health and readiness, facilitating
  automatic actions like restarting or rescheduling unresponsive instances for improved reliability. 
  They play a proactive role in issue detection, allowing timely problem resolution and contribute 
  to efficient scaling and traffic distribution.

rationale: |-
  Many applications running for long periods of time eventually transition to broken states, and 
  cannot recover except by being restarted. Kubernetes provides liveness probes to detect and remedy
  such situations.
  Sometimes, applications are temporarily unable to serve traffic. For example, an application might 
  need to load large data or configuration files during startup, or depend on external services after
  startup. In such cases, you don't want to kill the application, but you don't want to send it 
  requests either. Kubernetes provides readiness probes to detect and mitigate these situations. 
  A pod with containers reporting that they are not ready does not receive traffic through Kubernetes 
  Services.

ocil_clause: 'Liveness or readiness probe is not set'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command to retrieve a list of deployments, daemonsets and statefulsets that 
    do not have liveness or readiness probes set for their containers:
    <pre>$ oc get deployments,statefulsets,daemonsets --all-namespaces -o json | jq '[ .items[] | select(.metadata.namespace | startswith("kube-") or startswith("openshift-") | not) | select( .spec.template.spec.containers[].readinessProbe != null and .spec.template.spec.containers[].livenessProbe != null ) | "\(.kind): \(.metadata.namespace)/\(.metadata.name)" ] | unique'</pre>

    Make sure that there is output nothing in the result or there are valid reason not to set a
    readiness or liveness probe for those workloads.
