title: 'Ensure Network Policies are Configured'

description: |-
    OpenShift supports Kubernetes NetworkPolicy via the ovs-networkpolicy plugin. 
    The Kubernetes NetworkPolicy plugin is preferred over the ovs-multitenant
    plugin because Kubernetes Network Policies provide more granular control.
    The ovs-networkpolicy plugin should be configured instead of the
    ovs-multitenant plugin.

rationale: |-
    Properly configured network policies ensure traffic between OpenShift
    tenants is isolated.

severity: high

ocil_clause: 'the ovs-networkpolicy plugin is not configured or network policies are not in use'

ocil: |-
    Verify on OpenShift master nodes the plugin being used:
    <pre>$ oc get networkpolicies</pre>

    Nodes should be properly configured to create network segmentation using the
    Network Polices plugin over the Multi-tenant plugin.
