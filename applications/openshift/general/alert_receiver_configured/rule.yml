title: Ensure the alert receiver is configured

description: |-
  In OpenShift Container Platform, an alert is fired when the conditions defined in an alerting
  rule are true. An alert provides a notification that a set of circumstances are apparent within
  a cluster. Firing alerts can be viewed in the Alerting UI in the OpenShift Container Platform
  web console by default. After an installation, you can configure OpenShift Container Platform
  to send alert notifications to external systems so that designate personnel can be alerted 
  in real time.

  OpenShift provides multiple alert recivers integrations to send realtime alerts to different
  services such as email, slack, pagerduty, webhooks, etc. [1][2]

rationale: |-
  Alerts are a critical part of the OpenShift Container Platform. Proper configuration of
  receiver is required so that alerts can be sent to external systems in real-time to notify
  users of potential issues.

ocil_clause: 'Alert receiver is not configured'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command to see if alert receiver has been configured to send alerts to a orgzinational defined external system:
    <pre>$ oc -n openshift-monitoring get secret alertmanager-main --template='{{ index .data "alertmanager.yaml" }}' | base64 --decode</pre>
    Make sure that alert receiver has configured to send alerts to at least one real time external notification system.
