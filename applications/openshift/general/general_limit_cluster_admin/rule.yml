title: 'Limit Use of cluster-admin Role'

description: |-
    Review users, groups, and service accounts, that are bound to the <tt>cluster-admin</tt>
    role and decide whether they require such access. Consider creating custom, least-privilege roles
    for users and service accounts.

rationale: |-
    The <tt>cluster-admin</tt> role contains elevated privileges and should only be used
    when necessary.

severity: low

ocil_clause: 'they are not'

ocil: |-
    To ensure that <tt>cluster-admin</tt> role is only used as where required, run
    the following command to receive a list of all associated bindings:
    <pre>$ oc get clusterrolebindings | grep cluster-admin</pre>

    Verify all bindings are appropriately bound to <tt>cluster-admin</tt>, which should
    reflect the least privilege required.

# Since this is operational guidance and not a configuration check,
# a CCE should not be assigned.
