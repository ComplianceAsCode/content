title: 'Ensure Network Segmentation is Configured'

description: |-
    OpenShift provides multi-tenant network isolation to segregate network
    traffic between containers belonging to different tenants (users or
    applications) while running on a shared cluster. Red Hat also works with
    3rd-party SDN vendors to provide the same level of capabilities integrated
    with OpenShift. For stronger security, create network segmentation using
    Network Policies as it provides finer-grained control.

rationale: |-
    Properly configured network policies ensure traffic between OpenShift
    tenants is isolated.

ocil_clause: 'they are not'

ocil: |-
    Verify on OpenShift master nodes the plugin being used:
    <pre>$ grep networkPluginName /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</pre>

    Nodes should be properly configured to create network segmentation using
    the Multi-tenant plugin or Network Policies.
