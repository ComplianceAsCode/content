  Verify that the logout redirect setting in web console configuration
  is set.

  Configure the web console's logout redirect to direct to an appropriate
  logout page.  If OpenShift is configured to use an OIDC provider,
  then the redirect needs to first go to the OIDC provider's logout page,
  and then it can be redirected to another logout page as needed.

  Run the following command to update the console

  > oc patch console.config.openshift.io cluster --type merge -p '{"spec":{"authentication":{"logoutRedirect":"<LOGOUT_URL>"}}}'

  where LOGOUT_URL is set to the logout page
