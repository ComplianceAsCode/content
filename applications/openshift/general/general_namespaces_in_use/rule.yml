title: 'Create administrative boundaries between resources using namespaces'

description: |-
   Use namespaces to isolate your Kubernetes objects.

rationale: |-
   Limiting the scope of user permissions can reduce the impact of mistakes or
   malicious activities. A Kubernetes namespace allows you to partition created
   resources into logically named groups. Resources created in one namespace can
   be hidden from other namespaces. By default, each resource created by a user
   in Kubernetes cluster runs in a default namespace, called default. You can
   create additional namespaces and attach resources and users to them. You can
   use Kubernetes Authorization plugins to create policies that segregate access
   to namespace resources between different users.

ocil_clause: 'Namespace usage needs review'

ocil: |-
    OpenShift projects wrap Kubernetes namespaces and are used by default in
    OpenShift 4.  Run the following command and review the namespaces created in
    the cluster.  <pre>$ oc get namespaces</pre> Ensure that the namespaces are
    the ones you need and are adequately administered.
