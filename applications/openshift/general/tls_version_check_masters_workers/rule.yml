title: Ensure TLS v1.2 is minimum for Openshift master and worker nodes

description: |-
  Ensure that the Kubelet is configured to only use strong cryptographic ciphers.
  To set the cipher suites for the kubelet, create new or modify existing
  <tt>KubeletConfig</tt> object along these lines, one for every
  <tt>MachineConfigPool</tt>:
    <pre>
    apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
    kind: KubeletConfig
    metadata:
       name: kubelet-config-$pool
    spec:
        machineConfigPoolSelector:
            matchLabels:
                pools.operator.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/$pool_name: ""
        kubeletConfig:
          tlsMinVersion: VersionTLS12
    </pre>

rationale: |-
  Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption to
  protect data. The system must implement cryptographic modules adhering to the higher
  standards approved by the federal government since this provides assurance they have been tested
  and validated.

    Run the following command to check the TLS version used on master and worker nodes:
    <pre>$ sudo grep -oE VersionTLS1[2-9]{1} /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf </pre>
    Make sure that the result has a onue of VersionTLSXX where XX is 12 or greater.
