title: 'Apply Security Context to Your Pods and Containers'

description: |-
   Apply Security Context to your Pods and Containers

rationale: |-
   A security context defines the operating system security settings (uid, gid,
   capabilities, SELinux role, etc..) applied to a container. When designing your
   containers and pods, make sure that you configure the security context for your
   pods, containers, and volumes. A security context is a property defined in the
   deployment yaml. It controls the security parameters that will be assigned to
   the pod/container/volume. There are two levels of security context: pod level
   security context, and container level security context.

ocil_clause: 'SCCs in Pod definitions need review'

ocil: |-
   Review the pod definitions in your cluster and verify that you have security
   contexts defined as appropriate.  OpenShift's Security Context Constraint
   feature is on by default in OpenShift 4 and applied to all pods deployed. SCC
   selection is determined by a combination of the values in the securityContext
   and the rolebindings for the account deploying the pod.
