title: 'Ensure that project templates autocreate Resource Quotas'

description: |-
    <p>
    Configure a template for newly created projects to use default resource
    quotas and make sure this template is referenced from the default
    project template.
    </p>
    <p>
    The OpenShift Container Platform API server automatically provisions
    new projects based on the project template that is identified by
    the <tt>projectRequestTemplate</tt> parameter in the clusterâ€™s project
    configuration resource.
    </p>
    <p>
    As a cluster administrator, you can modify the default project template
    so that new projects created would satisfy the chosen compliance
    standards.
    </p>
    <p>
    For more information, follow
    {{{ weblink(link="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/applications/projects/configuring-project-creation.html",
    text="the relevant documentation") }}}.
    </p>

rationale: |-
    <p>
    Running different applications on the same Kubernetes cluster creates a risk of 
    a "noisy neighbor" when one application monopolizes cluster resources.
    A resource quota, defined by a ResourceQuota object, provides constraints
    that limit aggregate resource consumption per project. It can limit
    the quantity of objects that can be created in a project by type, as
    well as the total amount of compute resources and storage that might
    be consumed by resources in that project.
    </p>
    <p>
    Editing the default project template to include ResourceQuotas in
    all new namespaces ensures that all namespaces include at least some
    ResourceQuotas objects.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ensuring that the project configuration references
    a project template that sets up the required objects for new projects ensures
    that all new projects will be set in accordance with centralized settings.
    </p>

    Verify that a Template exists in the <tt>openshift-config</tt> namespace
    that includes at least one ResourceQuota Kind in the list of .objects:
    <pre>oc get -nopenshift-config template -ojson |  jq -r '{{{ jqfilter }}}'</pre>
    If there is at least one matching template, the above query would
    return true.

    Verify that the project config named <tt>cluster</tt> references the
    projectRequestTemplate that defines ResourceQuotas:
    <pre>oc get project.config.openshift.io/cluster -ojsonpath="{.spec.projectRequestTemplate.name}"</pre>
