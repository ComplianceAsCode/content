title: 'Each Namespace should only host one application'

description: |-
   Use namespaces to isolate your Kubernetes objects.

rationale: |-
   Assigning a dedicated namespace to an application (or parts of an application)
   allows you to granularly control the access to this application on a kubernetes
   level. It also allows you control the network flow from and to other namespaces
   more easily.

ocil_clause: 'Application placement in namespaces needs review'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command and review the pods and how they are deployed in
    namespaces. <pre>$ oc get pod -o=custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,NAMESPACE:.metadata.namespace,APP:.metadata.labels.app\.kubernetes\.io/name --all-namespaces | grep -v "openshift-"</pre>
    You can use labels or other data as custom field which helps you to identify parts of an application.
    Ensure that there are only components of one application in each namespace.
