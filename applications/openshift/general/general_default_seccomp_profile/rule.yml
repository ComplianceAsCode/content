title: 'Ensure Seccomp Profile Pod Definitions'

description: |-
    Enable <tt>default</tt> seccomp profiles in your pod definitions.

rationale: |-
    Seccomp (secure computing mode) is used to restrict the set of system calls
    applications can make, allowing cluster administrators greater control over
    the security of workloads running in the cluster. Kubernetes disables
    seccomp profiles by default for historical reasons. You should enable it to
    ensure that the workloads have restricted actions available within the
    container.

ocil: |-
   In OpenShift 4, CRI-O is the supported runtime. CRI-O runs unconfined by
   default in order to meet CRI conformance criteria.  On RHEL CoreOS, the
   default seccomp policy is associated with CRI-O and stored in
   <tt>/etc/crio/seccomp.json</tt>.  The default profile is applied when the user asks
   for the runtime/default profile via annotation to the pod and when the
   associated SCC allows use of the specified seccomp profile.

   Configuration of allowable seccomp profiles is managed through OpenShift
   Security Context Constraints.
