title: 'Use Security Context Constrains as Compensating Controls for Privileged Containers'

description: |-
    Security Context Constraints (SCCs) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) can be used as
    compensating controls to mitigate the use of privileged containers. By default,
    the <tt>restricted</tt> SCC is granted to all authenticated users by default. The
    <tt>restricted</tt> SCC prevents privileged pods from running. Administrators may create
    less restrictive SCCs based on individual container needs. For example, if a container requires
    running as the root user, the <tt>anysuid</tt> SCC can be used, which will not expose additional
    access granted by running privileged containers.

    Refer to the <i>Managing Security Context Constraints</i> chapter of the OpenShift Cluster Administration
    documentation for implementation guidance:

    https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/admin_guide/manage_scc.html

rationale: |-
    Usage of SCCs and RBAC may mitigate the risks of using privileged containers by restricting
    workloads to minimal system calls and resource access.

ocil: |-
    Determine all SCCs that allow privileged containers:
    <pre>$ oc get scc -ocustom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,ALLOWS_PRIVILEGED:.allowPrivilegedContainer</pre>

    Review users and groups assigned to SCCs allowing privileged containers:
    <pre>$ oc describe sccs <i>scc-id</i></pre>

    Adjust or assign SCCs or create custom SCCs as needed to minimize privileges.
