title: 'Enable seccomp'

description: |-
    Seccomp (secure computing mode) is used to restrict the set of system calls applications can make,
    allowing cluster administrators greater control over the security of workloads running in
    the OpenShift Container Platform.

    By default OpenShift is delivered with seccomp disabled, allowing all workloads to run
    unconfined and issue all system calls.

    To configure seccomp profiles, follow the instructions in the OpenShift Cluster
    Administration documentation:

    https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/admin_guide/seccomp.html

rationale: |-
    Failure to enable seccomp will allow containers to issue any and all system calls
    available in the environment.

    Verify that Security Context Constraints (SCCs) have been configured with seccomp:
    <pre>$ oc get scc -ocustom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,SECCOMP-PROFILES:.seccompProfiles</pre>

# Since this is operational guidance and not a configuration check,
# a CCE should not be assigned.
