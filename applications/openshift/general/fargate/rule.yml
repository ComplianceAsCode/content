title: 'Consider Fargate for Untrusted Workloads'

description: |-
  It is Best Practice to restrict or fence untrusted workloads when running in
  a multi-tenant environment.

rationale: |-
  AWS Fargate is a technology that provides on-demand, right-sized compute
  capacity for containers. With AWS Fargate, you no longer have to provision,
  configure, or scale groups of virtual machines to run containers. This
  removes the need to choose server types, decide when to scale your node
  groups, or optimize cluster packing.

  You can control which pods start on Fargate and how they run with Fargate
  profiles, which are defined as part of your Amazon EKS cluster.

  Amazon EKS integrates Kubernetes with AWS Fargate by using controllers that
  are built by AWS using the upstream, extensible model provided by Kubernetes.
  These controllers run as part of the Amazon EKS managed Kubernetes control
  plane and are responsible for scheduling native Kubernetes pods onto Fargate.
  The Fargate controllers include a new scheduler that runs alongside the
  default Kubernetes scheduler in addition to several mutating and validating
  admission controllers. When you start a pod that meets the criteria for
  running on Fargate, the Fargate controllers running in the cluster recognize,
  update, and schedule the pod onto Fargate.

  Each pod running on Fargate has its own isolation boundary and does not share
  the underlying kernel, CPU resources, memory resources, or elastic network
  interface with another pod.

  <b>Audit:</b>
  Check the existence of Fargate profiles in the Amazon EKS cluster by using:

  <tt>aws --region ${AWS_REGION} eks list-fargate-profiles --cluster-name ${CLUSTER_NAME}</tt>
  Alternatively, to audit for the presence of a Fargate profile node run the
  following command:
  <tt>kubectl get nodes</tt>
  The response should include a NAME entry starting with "fargate-ip" for
  example:
  <tt>NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION
  fargate-ip-192-168-104-74.us-east-2.compute.internal Ready 2m15s v1.14.8-eks</tt>

  <b>Remediation:</b>

  Create a Fargate profile for your cluster

  Before you can schedule pods running on Fargate in your cluster, you must define a Fargate
  profile that specifies which pods should use Fargate when they are launched. For more
  information, see AWS Fargate profile.

  Note
  If you created your cluster with eksctl using the <tt>--fargate</tt> option,
  then a Fargate profile has already been created for your cluster with
  selectors for all pods in the <tt>kube-system</tt> and default namespaces.
  Use the following procedure to create Fargate profiles for any other
  namespaces you would like to use with Fargate.

  via eksctl CLI

  Create your Fargate profile with the following eksctl command, replacing the
  variable text with your own values. You must specify a namespace, but the
  labels option is not required.
  <tt>eksctl create fargateprofile --cluster cluster_name --name
  fargate_profile_name --namespace kubernetes_namespace --labels key=value</tt>

  via AWS Management Console

  To create a Fargate profile for a cluster with the AWS Management Console

  <ol>
    <li>Open the Amazon EKS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home#/clusters.</li>
    <li>Choose the cluster to create a Fargate profile for.</li>
    <li>Under Fargate profiles, choose Add Fargate profile.</li>
    <li>On the Configure Fargate profile page, enter the following information
    and choose. For Name, enter a unique name for your Fargate profile. For Pod
    execution role, choose the pod execution role to use with your Fargate
    profile. Only IAM roles with the eks-fargate-pods.amazonaws.com service principal
    are shown. If you do not see any roles listed here, you must create one. For more
    information, see Pod execution role. For Subnets, choose the subnets to use
    for your pods. By default, all subnets in your cluster's VPC are selected.
    Only private subnets are supported for pods running on Fargate; you must
    deselect any public subnets. For Tags, you can optionally tag your Fargate
    profile. These tags do not propagate to other resources associated with the
    profile, such as its pods.</li>
    <li>5. On the Configure pods selection page, enter the following
    information and choose Next. list text hereFor Namespace, enter a namespace
    to match for pods, such as <tt>kube-system</tt> or default. list text
    here(Optional) Add Kubernetes labels to the selector that pods in the
    specified namespace must have to match the selector. For example, you could
    add the label <tt>infrastructure: fargate</tt> to the selector so that only pods in
    the specified namespace that also have the <tt>infrastructure: fargate</tt>
    Kubernetes label match the selector. </li>
    <li>On the Review and create page, review the information for your Fargate
    profile and choose Create.</li>
  </ol>
