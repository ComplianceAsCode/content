title: Ensure that Cluster Version Operator verifies integrity

description: |-
  Integrity of the OpenShift platform is handled to start by the cluster version operator.
  Cluster Version Operator will by default GPG verify the integrity of the release 
  image before applying it. This rule check if there is an unverified cluster image.

rationale: |-
  Unverified cluster image will compromise the system integrity. Integrity check prevent 
  a malicious actor from using a unauthorized system image, hence it will ensure the
  image has not been tampered with, or corrupted.
