title: 'Configure etcd Log Storage'

description: |-
    To ensure the <tt>etcd</tt> service is storing logs separate
    from data, set
    <tt>ETCD_WAL_DIR</tt> to <tt>/var/lib/etcd/member/wal</tt>
    in <tt>/etc/etcd/etcd.conf</tt> on the master node:
    <pre>ETCD_WAL_DIR=/var/lib/etcd/member/wal</pre>

rationale: |-
    etcd log files should be stored in a separate location from the etcd data.
    This not only ensures data integrity but also helps to prevent IO degradation.

ocil_clause: 'the etcd logs are not configured in a separate location'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ grep ETCD_WAL_DIR /etc/etcd/etcd.conf</pre>
    The output should return <tt>/var/lib/etcd/member/wal</tt>.
