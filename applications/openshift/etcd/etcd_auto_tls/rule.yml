title: 'Disable etcd Self-Signed Certificates'

description: |-
    To ensure the <tt>etcd</tt> service is not using self-signed
    certificates, edit the <tt>etcd</tt> configuration file
    <tt>/etc/etcd/etcd.conf</tt> from the master node and set
    <tt>ETCD_AUTO_TLS</tt> to <tt>false</tt>:
    <pre>ETCD_AUTO_TLS=false</pre>

rationale: |-
    Without cryptographic integrity protections, information can be
    altered by unauthorized users without detection. Using self-signed
    certificates ensures that the certificates are never validated
    against a certificate authority and could lead to compromised
    and invalidated data.
