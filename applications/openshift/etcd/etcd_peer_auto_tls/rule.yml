title: 'Disable etcd Peer Self-Signed Certificates'

description: |-
    To ensure the <tt>etcd</tt> service is not using self-signed
    certificates, run the following command:
    <pre>$ oc get cm/etcd-pod -n openshift-etcd -o yaml</pre>
    The etcd pod configuration contained in the configmap should not
    contain the <tt>--peer-auto-tls=true</tt> flag.

rationale: |-
    Without cryptographic integrity protections, information can be
    altered by unauthorized users without detection. Using self-signed
    certificates ensures that the certificates are never validated
    against a certificate authority and could lead to compromised
    and invalidated data.
