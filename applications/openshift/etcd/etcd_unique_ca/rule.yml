title: 'Configure A Unique CA Certificate for etcd'

description: |-
    A unique and different CA certificate should be created for <tt>etcd</tt>.
    To ensure the <tt>etcd</tt> service is using a unique certificate,
    , set <tt>ETCD_TRUSTED_CA_FILE</tt> to <tt>/etc/etcd/ca.crt</tt>
    in <tt>/etc/etcd/etcd.conf</tt> on the master node that does NOT match
    the OpenShift CA certificate:
{{%- if product == "ocp4" %}}
    <pre>ETCD_TRUSTED_CA_FILE=/etc/ssl/etcd/ca.crt</pre>
{{% else %}}
    <pre>ETCD_TRUSTED_CA_FILE=/etc/etcd/ca.crt</pre>
{{%- endif %}}

rationale: |-
    A unique CA certificate that is utilized by etcd and is different from
    OpenShift ensures that the etcd data is still protected in the event that
    the OpenShift certificate is compromised.

    Inspect the certificate file that is returned and verify that it
    does not match the OpenShift CA certificate.
