title: 'Configure A Unique CA Certificate for etcd'

description: |-
    A unique and different CA certificate should be created for <tt>etcd</tt>.
    To ensure the <tt>etcd</tt> service is using a unique certificate,
    , set <tt>ETCD_TRUSTED_CA_FILE</tt> to <tt>/etc/etcd/ca.crt</tt>
    in <tt>/etc/etcd/etcd.conf</tt> on the master node that does NOT match
    the OpenShift CA certificate:
    <pre>ETCD_TRUSTED_CA_FILE=/etc/etcd/ca.crt</pre>

rationale: |-
    A unique CA certificate that is utilized by etcd and is different from
    OpenShift ensures that the etcd data is still protected in the event that
    the OpenShift certificate is compromised.
