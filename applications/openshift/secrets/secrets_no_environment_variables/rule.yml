title: 'Do Not Use Environment Variables with Secrets'

description: |-
    Secrets should be mounted as data volumes instead of environment
    variables.

rationale: |-
    Environment variables are subject and very susceptible to
    malicious hijacking methods by an adversary, as such,
    environment variables should never be used for secrets.

severity: medium
