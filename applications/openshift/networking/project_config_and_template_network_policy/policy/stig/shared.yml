  {{{ full_name }}} must enforce approved authorizations for controlling
  the flow of information between interconnected systems and services
  based on organization-defined information flow control policies.

vuldiscussion: |-
  OpenShift provides several layers of protection to control the flow of
  information between the container platform components and user services. Each
  user project is given a separate namespace and OpenShift enforces RBAC
  policies controlling which projects and services users have access to. In
  addition, NetworkPolicies are used to control the flow of requests to and
  from externally integrated services to services hosted on the container
  platform. It is important to define a default Network Policy that will be
  applied automatically to new projects to prevent unintended requests. These
  policies can be updated by the project's administrator (with the appropriate
  RBAC permissions) to apply a policy that is appropriate to the service(s)
  within the project namespace.

check: |-
  Verify that a default project template is defined

  > oc get project.config.openshift.io/cluster \
  -o jsonpath="{.spec.projectRequestTemplate.name}"

  View the default NetworkPolicy

  > oc get templates/project-request -n openshift-config \
  -o jsonpath="{.objects[?(.kind=='NetworkPolicy')]}{'\n'}"

  If the default project template is not defined, or there are no
  NetworkPolicy definitions, this is a finding

fixtext: |-
  Configure a default network policy as necessary to protect the flow of
  information by performing the following steps.

  1. Create a bootstrap project template (if not already created)

  > oc adm create-bootstrap-project-template -o yaml > template.yaml

  2. Edit the template and add NetworkPolicy object definitions before
  the parameters section. For example, the following section defines two
  policies one to allow requests from the same namespace, the other to
  allow from the openshift ingress routing service.

  - apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: NetworkPolicy
    metadata:
      name: allow-from-same-namespace
    spec:
      podSelector:
      ingress:
      - from:
        - podSelector: {}
  - apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: NetworkPolicy
    metadata:
      name: allow-from-openshift-ingress
    spec:
      ingress:
      - from:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              network.openshift.io/policy-group: ingress
      podSelector: {}
      policyTypes:
      - Ingress
  parameters:

  3. Apply the project template to the cluster by running the following
  command:

  > oc create -f template.yaml -n openshift-config

  4. Set the default cluster project request template

  > oc patch project.config.openshift.io/cluster --type=merge \
  -p '{spec":{"projectRequestTemplate":{"name": "<PROJECT_REQUEST_TEMPLATE>"}}}'
