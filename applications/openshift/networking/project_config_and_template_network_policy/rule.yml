title: 'Ensure that project templates autocreate Network Policies'

description: |-
    Configure a template for newly created projects to use default network
    policies and make sure this template is referenced from the default
    project template.

    The OpenShift Container Platform API server automatically provisions
    new projects based on the project template that is identified by
    the <tt>projectRequestTemplate</tt> parameter in the clusterâ€™s project
    configuration resource.

    As a cluster administrator, you can modify the default project template
    so that new projects created would satisfy the chosen compliance
    standards.

    For more information on configuring default network policies, follow
    {{{ weblink(link="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/networking/network_policy/default-network-policy.html",
    text="the relevant documentation") }}}.

rationale: |-
    Running different applications on the same Kubernetes cluster creates a risk of one
    compromised application attacking a neighboring application. Network segmentation is
    important to ensure that containers can communicate only with those they are supposed
    to. When a network policy is introduced to a given namespace, all traffic not allowed
    by the policy is denied.

    Editing the default project template to include NetworkPolicies in
    all new namespaces ensures that all namespaces include at least some
    NetworkPolicy objects.

    Ensuring that the project configuration references
    a project template that sets up the required objects for new projects ensures
    that all new projects will be set in accordance with centralized settings.

{{% set api_path = '/apis/template.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/openshift-config/templates' %}}

ocil: |-
    Verify that a Template exists in the <tt>openshift-config</tt> namespace
    that includes at least one NetworkPolicy Kind in the list of .objects:
    <pre>oc get -nopenshift-config template -ojson |  jq -r '{{{ jqfilter }}}'</pre>
    If there is at least one matching template, the above query would
    return true.

    Verify that the project config named <tt>cluster</tt> references the
    projectRequestTemplate that defines NetworkPolicies:
    <pre>oc get project.config.openshift.io/cluster -ojsonpath="{.spec.projectRequestTemplate.name}"</pre>
