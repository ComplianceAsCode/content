title: 'Ensure Project Namespaces Use Network Policies'

description: |-
    Network policies should be configured for each project to isolate
    traffic on the network.

rationale: |-
    Running different applications on the same Kubernetes cluster creates a risk of one
    compromised application attacking a neighboring application. Network segmentation is
    important to ensure that containers can communicate only with those they are supposed
    to. When a network policy is introduced to a given namespace, all traffic not allowed
    by the policy is denied. However, if there are no network policies in a namespace all
    traffic will be allowed into and out of the pods in that namespace.

severity: high

ocil_clause: 'the NetworkPolicy plugin is not configured or network policies are not in use'

ocil: |-
    Verify on OpenShift namespaces that network policies are in use:
    <pre>$ oc get networkpolicy --all-namespaces</pre>
