title: 'Ensure that application Namespaces have Network Policies defined.'

description: |-
    Use network policies to isolate traffic in your cluster network.

rationale: |-
    Running different applications on the same Kubernetes cluster creates a risk of one
    compromised application attacking a neighboring application. Network segmentation is
    important to ensure that containers can communicate only with those they are supposed
    to. When a network policy is introduced to a given namespace, all traffic not allowed
    by the policy is denied. However, if there are no network policies in a namespace all
    traffic will be allowed into and out of the pods in that namespace.

severity: high

ocil_clause: 'Namespaced Network Policies needs review'

ocil: |-
    Verify on OpenShift namespaces that network policies are in use:
    <pre>$ oc get networkpolicy --all-namespaces</pre>
    Ensure that each namespace defined in the cluster has at least one NetworkPolicy.
