title: 'Limiting Network Bandwidth in Pods'

description: |-
    Network bandwidth, SHOULD be appropriately reserved and limited.

ocil: |-
    Network bandwidth is limited at the pod level and can be determined separately according
    to incoming and outgoing network bandwidth.
    For more information about limiting network bandwidth on the pod level please refer to the Red Hat documentation:
    {{{ weblink(link="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.17/nodes/pods/nodes-pods-configuring.html#nodes-pods-configuring-bandwidth_nodes-pods-configuring") }}}

    Out of the documetation use the example for the network bandwidth configuration of a pod: 
    <pre>
    kind: Pod
    apiVersion: v1
    metadata:
      name: hello-openshift
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/ingress-bandwidth: 2M
        kubernetes.io/egress-bandwidth: 1M
    spec:
        containers:
          - image: openshift/hello-openshift
            name: hello-openshift
    </pre>

ocil_clause: 'Limiting Pod network bandwidth on OCP 4'

rationale: |-
    Extend pod configuration with network bandwidth annotations to prevent
    a bad actor or a malfunction in the pod to consume all the bandwidth in the cluster.
    A network bandwidth limitation on the pod level can mitigate the bearing onto the cluster.
