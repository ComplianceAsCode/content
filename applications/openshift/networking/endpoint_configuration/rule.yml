title: 'Ensure Private Endpoint Access'

description: |-
  Disable access to the Kubernetes API from outside the node network if it is
  not required.

rationale: |-
  In a private cluster, the master node has two endpoints, a private and public
  endpoint. The private endpoint is the internal IP address of the master,
  behind an internal load balancer in the master's VPC network. Nodes
  communicate with the master using the private endpoint. The public endpoint
  enables the Kubernetes API to be accessed from outside the master's VPC
  network.

  Although Kubernetes API requires an authorized token to perform sensitive
  actions, a vulnerability could potentially expose the Kubernetes publically
  with unrestricted access. Additionally, an attacker may be able to identify
  the current cluster and Kubernetes API version and determine whether it is
  vulnerable to an attack. Unless required, disabling public endpoint will help
  prevent such threats, and require the attacker to be on the master's VPC
  network to perform any attack on the Kubernetes API.
