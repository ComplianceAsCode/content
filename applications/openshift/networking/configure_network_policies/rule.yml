title: 'Ensure Network Policies are Configured'

description: |-
    OpenShift supports Kubernetes NetworkPolicy using a Kubernetes
    Container Network Interface (CNI) plug-in. The Kubernetes NetworkPolicy
    plugin is preferred because Kubernetes Network Policies provide more granular control.

rationale: |-
    Properly configured network policies ensure traffic between OpenShift
    tenants is isolated.

severity: high

ocil_clause: 'the NetworkPolicy plugin is not configured or network policies are not in use'

ocil: |-
    Verify on OpenShift that the NetworkPolicy plugin is being used:
    <pre>$ oc get networkpolicy</pre>

    A network policy should be properly configured to create network segmentation.
