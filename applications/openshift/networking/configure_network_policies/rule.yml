title: 'Ensure that the CNI in use supports Network Policies'

description: |-
    There are a variety of CNI plugins available for Kubernetes. If the CNI in
    use does not support Network Policies it may not be possible to effectively
    restrict traffic in the cluster. OpenShift supports Kubernetes NetworkPolicy
    using a Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) plug-in.

rationale: |-
    Kubernetes network policies are enforced by the CNI plugin in use. As such
    it is important to ensure that the CNI plugin supports both Ingress and
    Egress network policies.

severity: high

ocil_clause: 'Support for Network Policies needs review'

ocil: |-
    Verify on OpenShift that the NetworkPolicy plugin is being used:
    <pre>$ oc explain networkpolicy</pre>
    The resulting output should be an explanation of the NetworkPolicy resource.
