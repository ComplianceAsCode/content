  Verify that the CNI supports NetworkPolicies:
  > oc get network cluster -oyaml -ojsonpath='{.spec.networkType}'

  The result should list a CNI plugin that supports NetworkPolicies,
  currently the plugins that do support NetworkPolicies are OpenShiftSDN,
  OVN and Calico.

  If the cluster does not return a CNI that supports NetworkPolicies,
  this is a finding.

  Migration to a supported CNI plugin is not automated.
