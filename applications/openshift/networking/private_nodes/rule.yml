title: 'Ensure Cluster Private Nodes'

description: |-
  Disable public IP addresses for cluster nodes, so that they only have private
  IP addresses. Private Nodes are nodes with no public IP addresses.

rationale: |-
  Disabling public IP addresses on cluster nodes restricts access to only
  internal networks, forcing attackers to obtain local network access before
  attempting to compromise the underlying Kubernetes hosts.

ocil_clause: 'clusters are created with private nodes'

ocil: |-
  To enable Private Nodes, the cluster has to also be configured with a private
  master IP range and IP Aliasing enabled. Private Nodes do not have outbound
  access to the public internet.

  If you want to provide outbound Internet access for your private nodes, you
  can use Cloud NAT or you can manage your own NAT gateway.
