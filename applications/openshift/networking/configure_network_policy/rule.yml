title: 'Ensure Network Policy is Enabled'

description: |-
  Use Network Policy to restrict pod to pod traffic within a cluster and
  segregate workloads.

rationale: |-
  By default, all pod to pod traffic within a cluster is allowed. Network
  Policy creates a pod- level firewall that can be used to restrict traffic
  between sources. Pod traffic is restricted by having a Network Policy that
  selects it (through the use of labels). Once there is any Network Policy in a
  namespace selecting a particular pod, that pod will reject any connections
  that are not allowed by any Network Policy. Other pods in the namespace that
  are not selected by any Network Policy will continue to accept all traffic.

  Network Policies are managed via the Kubernetes Network Policy API and
  enforced by a network plugin, simply creating the resource without a
  compatible network plugin to implement it will have no effect. EKS supports
  Network Policy enforcement through the use of Calico.

ocil_clause: 'network policy is enabled'

ocil: |-
  Network Policy requires the Network Policy add-on. This add-on is included
  automatically when a cluster with Network Policy is created, but for an
  existing cluster, needs to be added prior to enabling Network Policy.

  Enabling/Disabling Network Policy causes a rolling update of all cluster
  nodes, similar to performing a cluster upgrade. This operation is
  long-running and will block other operations on the cluster (including
  delete) until it has run to completion.

  If Network Policy is used, a cluster must have at least 2 nodes of type
  <tt>n1-standard-1</tt> or higher. The recommended minimum size cluster to run
  Network Policy enforcement is 3 <tt>n1-standard-1</tt> instances.

  Enabling Network Policy enforcement consumes additional resources in nodes.
  Specifically, it increases the memory footprint of the <tt>kube-system</tt>
  process by approximately 128MB, and requires approximately 300 millicores of
  CPU.
