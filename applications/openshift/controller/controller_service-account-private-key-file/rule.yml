title: 'Ensure that the --service-account-private-key-file argument is set'

description: |-
    To explicitly set a service account private key file on the
    Controller, edit the Controller Manager pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml</tt> on the
    master node(s) and set the <tt>--service-account-private-key-file</tt>
    parameter to the private key file for service accounts. For example:

    <pre>--service-account-private-key-file=<i>filename</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    To ensure that keys for service account tokens can be rotated as needed,
    a separate public/private key pair should be used for signing service account
    tokens. The private key should be specified to the controller manager with
    <tt>--service-account-private-key-file</tt> as appropriate.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: '<tt>--service-account-private-key-file</tt> is not set as appropriate'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager</pre>

    Verify that the <tt>--service-account-private-key-file</tt>
    argument is set as appropriate.
