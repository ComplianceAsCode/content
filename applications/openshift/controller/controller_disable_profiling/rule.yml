title: 'Verify Controller Profiling is not Exposed to the Web'

description: |-
    Profiling endpoints are exposed at each master port and secured via Role-Based
    Access Control (RBAC). By default profiling is accessible only to users bound to
    <tt>cluster-admin</tt> or <tt>cluster-debugger</tt> roles, limiting access to authorized
    users only.

    Should <tt>OPENSHIFT_PROFILE</tt> be set to <tt>web</tt>, reflecting a change from
    the secure defaults, this profiling data will be exposed via a web interface on the
    systems localhost interface.

    To ensure profiling data is not exposed over a web interface, ensure
    <tt>OPENSHIFT_PROFILE</tt> is not set to <tt>web</tt> in <tt>/etc/origin/master/master.env</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Profiling data may include sensitive system information which could be exploited.

    Verify that <tt>OPENSHIFT_PROFILE</tt> is not set to <tt>web</tt> by running the following command:
    <pre>$ grep OPENSHIFT_PROFILE /etc/origin/master/master.env</pre>

    Verify that <tt>OPENSHIFT_PROFILE=web</tt> is NOT returned.
