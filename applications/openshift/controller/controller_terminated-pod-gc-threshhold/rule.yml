title: 'Ensure that the --terminated-pod-gc-threshold argument is set'

description: |-
    To activate garbage collector on pod termination, edit the Controller
    Manager pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml</tt> on the
    master node and set the <tt>--terminated-pod-gc-threshold</tt> to an
    appropriate threshold. For example:

    <pre>--terminated-pod-gc-threshold=10</pre>

rationale: |-
    Garbage collection is important to ensure sufficient resource availability
    and avoiding degraded performance and availability. In the worst case,
    the system might crash or just be unusable for a long period of time. The
    default setting for garbage collection is 12,500 terminated pods which
    might be to high for your system to sustain. Based on your system resources
    and tests, choose an appropriate threshold value to activate garbage
    collection.

ocil_clause: '<tt>--terminated-pod-gc-threshold</tt> is not set as appropriate'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager</pre>

    Verify that the <tt>--terminated-pod-gc-threshold</tt> argument is set
    as appropriate.
