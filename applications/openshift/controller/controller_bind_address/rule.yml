title: 'Ensure Controller bind-address argument is set'

description: |-
    To ensure the Controller Manager service is bound to secure loopback
    address, edit the Controller Manager pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</tt> on the
    master node(s) and ensure the correct value for the <tt>bind-address</tt>
    parameter. For example:
    <pre>kubernetesMasterConfig:
      controllerArguments:
        bind-address:
          - '192.168.1.101'</pre>


warnings:
  - functionality: |-
      The associated value must be reachable by the rest of the cluster, and by
      CLI/web clients. If blank all interfaces will be used (<tt>0.0.0.0</tt> for IPv4
      and ``::`` for IPv6).

rationale: |-
    The Controller Manager API service (which runs on a port specified by the
    <tt>secure-port</tt> argument) is used for health and metrics
    information and is available without authentication or encryption. As such it
    should only be bound to a localhost interface, to minimize the cluster's
    attack surface.

ocil_clause: |-
    <tt>bind-address</tt> is not configured to a secure IP address

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep bind-address /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</pre>

    Verify that the <tt>bind-address</tt> argument is set to a secure
    IP address.
