title: 'Ensure that the --root-ca-file argument is set'

description: |-
    To ensure pods verify the API Server's serving certificate before
    establishing connections, edit the Controller Manager pod specification
    file <tt>/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml</tt>
    on the master node(s) and set the <tt>--root-ca-file</tt> parameter
    to the certificate bundle file. For example:

    <pre>--root-ca-file=<i>/path/to/file</i></pre>

rationale: |-
    Processes running within pods that need to contact the API Server must
    verify the API Server's serviing certificate. Failing to do so risks
    the environment encountering man-in-the-middle attacks.

    Providing the root certificate for the API Server's serving certificate
    to the controller manager with the <tt>--root-ca-file</tt> argument allows
    the controller manager to inject the trusted bundle into pods so that they
    can verify TLS connections to the API Server.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: |-
    <tt>--root-ca-file</tt> argument does not exist or is not set to a certificate
    bundle file containing the root certificate for the API Server's serving
    certificate.

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager</pre>

    Verify that the <tt>--root-ca-file</tt> argument exists and is set
    to a certificate bundle file containing the root certificate for the
    API Server's serving certificate.
