title: 'Enable terminated-pod-gc-threshold for the Controller Manager'

description: |-
    To ensure the garbage collector is activated upon pod termination,
    edit the Controller Manager pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</tt> on the
    master node(s) and set the <tt>terminated-pod-gc-threshold</tt> to
    <tt>true</tt>. For example:
    <pre>kubernetesMasterConfig:
      controllerArguments:
        terminated-pod-gc-threshold:
          - true</pre>

rationale: |-
    Garbage collection is important to ensure sufficient resource availability
    and avoiding degraded performance and availability. In the worst case,
    the system might crash or just be unusable for a long period of time. The
    default setting for garbage collection is 12,500 terminated pods which
    might be to high for your system to sustain. Based on your system resources
    and tests, choose an appropriate threshold value to activate garbage
    collection.

severity: low

ocil_clause: '<tt>terminated-pod-gc-threshold</tt> is not enabled'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep terminated-pod-gc-threshold /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</pre>

    Verify that the <tt>terminated-pod-gc-threshold</tt> argument is not set
    to <tt>false</tt>.

    If the configuration file does not explicitly set
    <tt>terminated-pod-gc-threshold</tt>, and the grep command returns no
    text, the default value of <tt>true</tt> is being used.
