title: 'Ensure that the RotateKubeletServerCertificate argument is set'

description: |-
    To enforce kublet server certificate rotation on the Controller Manager,
    edit the Controller Manager pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml</tt> on the
    master node(s) and set the <tt>--feature-gates</tt> parameter to include
    <tt>RotateKubeletServerCertificate=true</tt>. For example:

    <pre>--feature-gates=...,RotateKubletServerCertificate=true,...</pre>

rationale: |-
    <tt>RotateKubeletServerCertificate</tt> causes the kubelet to both request
    a serving certificate after bootstrapping its client credentials and rotate the
    certificate as its existing credentials expire. This automated periodic rotation
    ensures that there are no downtimes due to expired certificates and thus
    addressing the availability in the C/I/A security triad.

    NOTE: This recommendation only applies if you let kubelets get their
    certificates from the API Server. In case your certificates come from an
    outside Certificate Authority/tool (e.g. Vault) then you need to take care
    of rotation yourself.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: |-
    <tt>RotateKubeletServerCertificate=true</tt> argument is not present in the
    <tt>--feature-gates</tt> options

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager</pre>

    Verify that the <tt>RotateKubletServerCertificate</tt> argument exists
    and is set to <tt>true</tt>.
