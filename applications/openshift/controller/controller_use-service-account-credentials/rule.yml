title: 'Ensure that the --use-service-account-credentials argument is set'

description: |-
    To configure individual service account credentials for each controller,
    edit the Controller Manager pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml</tt> on the
    master node(s) and set <tt>--use-service-account-credentials</tt>
    to <tt>true</tt>. For example:

    <pre>--use-service-account-credentials=true</pre>

rationale: |-
    The controller manager creates a service account per controller in
    <tt>kube-system</tt> namespace, generates a credential for it,
    and builds a dedicated API client with that service account credential
    for each controller loop to use. Setting the
    <tt>--use-service-account-credentials</tt> to <tt>true</tt> runs each
    control loop within the contoller manager using a separate service
    account credential. When used in combination with RBAC, this ensures
    that the control loops run with the minimum permissions required to
    perform their intended tasks.

severity: low

ocil_clause: '<tt>--use-service-account-credentials</tt> is not set to <tt>true</tt>'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager</pre>

    Verify that the <tt>--use-service-account-credentials</tt> argument is set to <tt>true</tt>.
