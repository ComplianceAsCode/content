title: 'Configure the Service Account Private Key for the Controller Manager'

description: |-
    To ensure the API Server utilizes its own key pair, set the <tt>privateKeyFile</tt>
    parameter to the public key file for service accounts in the <tt>openshift-kube-controller-manager</tt> configmap on the master
    node(s):
    <pre>
    "extendedArguments": {
    ...
      "service-account-private-key-file": [
        "/etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/secrets/service-account-private-key/service-account.key"
      ],
    ...
    </pre>

rationale: |-
    By default if no private key file is specified to the
    API Server, the API Server uses the private key from the TLS serving
    certificate to verify service account tokens. To ensure that the keys
    for service account tokens could be rotated as needed, a separate
    public/private key pair should be used for signing service account
    tokens.

ocil: |-
    To verify that <tt>service-account-private-key-file</tt> is configured correctly,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ oc get configmaps config -n openshift-kube-controller-manager -ojson | jq -r '.data["config.yaml"]' | jq -r '.extendedArguments["service-account-private-key-file"]'</pre>
    The output should return a configured private key file.
