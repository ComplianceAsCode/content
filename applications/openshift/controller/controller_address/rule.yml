title: 'Ensure that the --address argument is set'

description: |-
    To ensure the Controller Manager service is bound to secure loopback
    address, edit the Controller Manager pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml</tt> on the
    master node(s) and ensure the correct value for the <tt>--address</tt>
    parameter.

rationale: |-
    The Controller Manager API service which runs on port 10252/TCP by default
    is used for health and metrics information and is available without
    authentication or encryption. As such it should only be bound to a localhost
    interface, to minimize the cluster's attack surface.

severity: low

ocil_clause: |-
    <tt>--address</tt> is not configured to a secure loopback IP address

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager</pre>

    Verify that the <tt>--address</tt> argument is set to a secure
    loopback IP address (for example, <tt>127.0.0.1</tt>).
