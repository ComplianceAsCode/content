title: 'Ensure Infrastructure Nodes are Distributed Across Three Failure Zones'

description: |- 
    Distributing Kubernetes infrastructure nodes across failure zones enhances security by mitigating
    the risk of a single point of failure and reducing the impact of infrastructure service
    inavailability or attacks targeting a specific zone.

rationale: |-
    Distributing Kubernetes infrastructure nodes across failure zones is crucial for enhancing overall 
    system resilience and security. By spreading infrastructure components across different zones, 
    the system becomes more fault-tolerant, reducing the risk of widespread outages due to failures or 
    attacks in a single zone. 
    For infrastructure nodes, two failure zones are often deemed sufficient due to the nature of 
    infrastructure services, which typically don't rely on quorum-based applications like etcd. 
    Infrastructure services such as Ingress load balancers, logging or monitoring systems usually
    operate independently across zones without requiring coordination for data consistency or failover. 
    Failure zones are marked on nodes using a well-known label called "topology.kubernetes.io/zone". 
    This label is automatically assigned to each node by cloud providers but might need to be managed
    manually in other environments

ocil: |-
    Run the following command to determine the failure zones of the infrastructure nodes, indicated by
    the label .
    <pre>$ oc get nodes --selector "node-role.kubernetes.io/infra" -o custom-columns='NAME:.metadata.name,ZONE:.metadata.labels.topology\.kubernetes\.io/zone'</pre>
    Make sure that three distinct zones are listed.
