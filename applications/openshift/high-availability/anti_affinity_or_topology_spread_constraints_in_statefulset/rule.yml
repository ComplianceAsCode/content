title: 'Ensure Statefulsets have either Anti-Affinity Rules or Topology Spread Constraints'

description: |-
    Distributing Kubernetes pods across nodes and availability zones using pod topology spread
    constraints and anti-affinity rules enhances high availability, fault tolerance, performance,
    and security by balancing workloads, reducing single points of failure, and ensuring compliance
    and data protection.

    There might be statefulsets, that do not require high availability or spreading across nodes.
    To limit the number of false positives, this rule only checks statefulsets with a replica count
    of more than one. For statefulsets with one replica, neither anti-affinity rules nor topology
    spread constraints provide any value.

    To exclude other statefulsets from this rule, you can create a regular expression for statefulset
    names: <tt>var_statefulsets_without_high_availability</tt>. This will ignore statefulsets matching
    those names in all namespaces.

rationale: |-
    Distributing Kubernetes pods across nodes and availability zones using pod topology spread
    constraints and anti-affinity rules is essential for enhancing high availability, fault
    tolerance, and security.
    This approach ensures that a single node or AZ failure does not lead to total application
    downtime, as workloads are balanced and resources are efficiently utilized.

ocil: |-
    Run the following command to determine anti-affinity rules and topology spread constraints of
    all statefulsets:
    <pre>$ oc get statefulsets -A -o json | jq '{{{ jqfilter }}}'</pre>
    Make sure that either suitable anti-affinity rule or topology spread constraints are configured
    for all workloads that require high availability.
