title: 'Verify Group Who Owns The Worker Proxy Kubeconfig File'

description: |-
  To ensure the Kubernetes ConfigMap is mounted into the sdn daemonset pods with the
  correct ownership, make sure that the <tt>sdn-config</tt> ConfigMap is mounted using
  a ConfigMap at the <tt>/config</tt> mount point and that the <tt>sdn</tt> container
  points to that configuration using the <tt>--proxy-config</tt> command line option.
  Run:
  <pre> oc get -nopenshift-sdn ds sdn -ojson | jq -r '.spec.template.spec.containers[] | select(.name == "sdn")'</pre>
  and ensure the <tt>--proxy-config</tt> parameter points to 
  <tt>/config/kube-proxy-config.yaml</tt> and that the <tt>config</tt> mount point is
  mounted from the <tt>sdn-config</tt> ConfigMap.

rationale: |-
  The kubeconfig file for kube-proxy provides permissions to the kube-proxy service.
  The proxy kubeconfig file contains information about the administrative configuration of the
  OpenShift cluster that is configured on the system. Protection of this file is
  critical for OpenShift security.

  The file is provided via a ConfigMap mount, so the kubelet itself makes sure that the
  file permissions are appropriate for the container taking it into use.

  Run the following command:
  <pre>
   $ for i in $(oc get pods -n openshift-sdn -l app=sdn -oname)
     do
        oc exec -n openshift-sdn $i -- stat -Lc %U:%G /config/kube-proxy-config.yaml
