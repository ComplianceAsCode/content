title: 'Verify User Who Owns The Worker Proxy Kubeconfig File'

description: '{{{ describe_file_owner(file="/config/kube-proxy-config.yaml", owner="root") }}}'

rationale: |-
  The kubeconfig file for kube-proxy provides permissions to the kube-proxy service.
  The proxy kubeconfig file contains information about the administrative configuration of the
  OpenShift cluster that is configured on the system. Protection of this file is
  critical for OpenShift security.

  The file is provided via a ConfigMap mount, so the kubelet itself makes sure that the
  file permissions are appropriate for the container taking it into use.
