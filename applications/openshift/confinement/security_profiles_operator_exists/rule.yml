title: "Make sure the Security Profiles Operator is installed"

description: |-
    Security Profiles Operator provides a way to define secure computing (seccomp) profiles and
    SELinux profiles as custom resources that are syncrhonized to every node in a given namespace.

    Using security profiles can increase security at the container level in your cluster.
    Seccomp security profiles list the syscalls a process can make, and SELinux security profiles
    provide a label-based system that restricts access and usage of processes, applications, and
    files.

rationale: |-
  An application that runs with privileges can be attacked to have its privileges exploited.
  Confining applications limit the actions an attacker can perform when they are compromised.

  To check if the Security Profiles Operator is installed, run the following command:
  <pre>oc get sub -nopenshift-security-profiles security-profiles-operator-sub -ojsonpath='{.status.installedCSV}'</pre>
  the output should return the version of the CSV that represents the installed operator.
