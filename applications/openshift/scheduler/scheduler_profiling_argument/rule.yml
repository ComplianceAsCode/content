title: 'Disable Scheduler Profiling'

description: |-
    Profiling should be disabled if not needed. To disable profiling,
    edit the Scheduler pod specification file
    <tt>/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</tt> file on the master
    node and set the below parameter:
    <pre>kubernetesMasterConfig:
      schedulerArguments:
        profiling:
        - false</pre>

rationale: |-
    Profiling allows for the identification of specific performance
    bottlenecks. It generates a significant amount of program data that could
    potentially be exploited to uncover system and program details. If you are
    not experiencing any bottlenecks and do not need the profiler for
    troubleshooting purposes, it is recommended to turn it off to reduce the
    potential attack surface.

severity: low

ocil_clause: 'profiling is not being used and is not disabled'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the master node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep -A2 profiling /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml</pre>
    The output should return <tt>false</tt>.
