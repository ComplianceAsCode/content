title: Ensure that OpenShift Logging Operator is scanning the cluster

description: |-
  OpenShift Logging Operator provides ability to aggregate all the logs from the
  OpenShift Container Platform cluster, such as node system audit logs, application
  container logs, and infrastructure logs. OpenShift Logging aggregates these logs
  from throughout OpenShift cluster and stores them in a default log store. [1]

  [1]https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/logging/cluster-logging.html

rationale: |-
  OpenShift Logging Operator is able to collect, aggregate, and manage logs.

ocil_clause: 'OpenShift Logging Operator is not installed'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command to retrieve the clusterlogging objects in the system:
    <pre>$ oc get clusterloggings --all-namespaces</pre>
    Make sure the OpenShift Logging Operator is installed and there exists
    at least one active clusterlogging object in the cluster.
