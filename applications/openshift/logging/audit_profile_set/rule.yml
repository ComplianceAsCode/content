title: Ensure that the cluster's audit profile is properly set

description: |-
  <p>
  OpenShift can audit the details of requests made to the API server through
  the standard Kubernetes audit capabilities. 
  </p>

  <p>
  In OpenShift, auditing of the API Server is on by default. Audit provides a
  security-relevant chronological set of records documenting the sequence of
  activities that have affected system by individual users, administrators, or
  other components of the system. Audit works at the API server level, logging
  all requests coming to the server. Each audit log contains two entries:
  </p>

  <p>
  The request line containing:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>A Unique ID allowing to match the response line (see #2)</li>
    <li>The source IP of the request</li>
    <li>The HTTP method being invoked</li>
    <li>The original user invoking the operation</li>
    <li>The impersonated user for the operation (self meaning himself)</li>
    <li>The impersonated group for the operation (lookup meaning user's group)</li>
    <li>The namespace of the request or none</li>
    <li>The URI as requested</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  The response line containing:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The aforementioned unique ID</li>
    <li>The response code</li>
  </ul>

  <p>

  Logging is an important detective control for all systems, to detect potential
  unauthorised access.

ocil: |-
    Run the following command to retrieve the current audit profile:
    <pre>$ oc get apiservers cluster -ojsonpath='{.spec.audit.profile}'</pre>
    Make sure the profile returned matches the one that should be used.
