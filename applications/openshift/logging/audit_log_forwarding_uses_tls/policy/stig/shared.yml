  Verify that the Cluster Log Forwarder is using an encrypted transport:

  > oc get clusterlogforwarder -n openshift-logging

  For each Cluster Log Forwarder, run the following command to display the configuration

  > oc describe clusterlogforwarder <name> -n openshift-logging

  Review the configuration and determine if the transport is secure, such
  as tls:// or https://. If there are any transports configured that are
  not secured by TLS, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
  Edit the Cluster Log Forwarder configuration to configure TLS on the transport.

  > oc edit clusterlogforwarder <name> -n openshift-logging

  For detailed information regarding
  configuration of the Cluster Log Forwarder see
  https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/logging/cluster-logging-external.html

srg_requirement: |-
  The container platform must use FIPS validated cryptographic mechanisms to protect the integrity
  of log information.
