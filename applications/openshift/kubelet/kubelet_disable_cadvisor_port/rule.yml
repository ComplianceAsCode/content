title: 'kubelet - Disable cAdvisor Port'

description: |-
    The <tt>cAdvisor</tt> port should be disabled as it does not require
    any authentication to connect to the port.
    To disable the <tt>cAdvisor</tt> port, edit the kubelet configuration
    file <tt>/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml</tt>
    on the kubelet node(s) and set the below parameter:
    <pre>kubeletArguments:
      cadvisor-port:
      - '0'</pre>

rationale: |-
    Any form of authentication to ports anonymously should be disabled. An attacker
    could connect to the port and gain cluster information anonymously.

severity: high

ocil_clause: 'the cAdvisor port is not disabled'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the kubelet node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep -A1 cadvisor-port /etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml</pre>
    The output should return <tt>0</tt>.
