title: 'kubelet - Ensure AlwaysAllow Is Not Set'

description: |-
    By default, the kubelet allows all types of authentication requests including
    anonymous requests. The <tt>AlwaysAll</tt> option should not be used as it will
    allow all types of authentication requests.

    To require authorization requests, edit the kubelet configuration
    file <tt>/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml</tt>
    on the kubelet node(s) and set the below parameter:
    <pre>kubeletArguments:
      authorization-mode:
      - '<sub idref="var_kube_authorization_mode"/>'</pre>

rationale: |-
    When enabled, all type of authentication requests including anonymous requests are
    enabled regardless of what is configured on the API server. OpenShift Operators should
    rely on authentication to authorize access and disallow anonymous
    requests.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: 'the AlwaysAllow option is not configured'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the kubelet node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep -A1 authorization-mode /etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml</pre>
    The output should return <tt><sub idref="var_kube_authorization_mode"/></tt>.
