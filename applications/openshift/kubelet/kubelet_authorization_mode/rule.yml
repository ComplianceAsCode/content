title: 'Ensure authorization is set to Webhook'

description: |-
    Unauthenticated/unauthorized users should have no access to OpenShift nodes.
    The Kubelet should be set to only allow Webhook authorization.
    To ensure that the Kubelet requires authorization,
    validate that <tt>authorization</tt> is configured to <tt>Webhook</tt>
    in <tt>/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf</tt>:
    <pre>
    authorization:
      mode: Webhook
      ...
    </pre>

rationale: |-
    Ensuring that the authorization is configured correctly helps enforce that
    unauthenticated/unauthorized users have no access to OpenShift nodes.
