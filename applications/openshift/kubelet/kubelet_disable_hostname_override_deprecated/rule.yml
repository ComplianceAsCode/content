title: 'kubelet - Hostname Override handling'

description: |-
    Normally, OpenShift lets the kubelet get the hostname from either the
    cloud provider itself, or from the node's hostname. This ensures that
    the PKI allocated by the deployment uses the appropriate values, is valid
    and keeps working throughout the lifecycle of the cluster. IP addresses
    are not used, and hence this makes it easier for security analysts to
    associate kubelet logs with the appropriate node.
rationale: |-
    Allowing hostnames to be overridden creates issues around resolving nodes
    in addition to TLS configuration, certificate validation, and log correlation
    and validation.
{{%- if product == "ocp4"  %}}
    However, in some cases explicit overriding this parameter is
    necessary to ensure that the appropriate node name stays as it is in case of
    certain upgrade conditions. e.g. as is the case in AWS and OpenStack when migrating
    to external cloud providers.
