title: 'Kubelet - Ensure Event Creation Is Configured'

description: |-
    Security relevant information should be captured. The eventRecordQPS
    Kubelet option can be used to limit the rate at which events are gathered.
    Setting this too low could result in relevant events not being logged,
    however the unlimited setting of 0 could result in a denial of service on
    the kubelet. Processing and storage systems should be scaled to handle the
    expected event load. To set the <tt>eventRecordQPS</tt> option for the kubelet,
    create a <tt>KubeletConfig</tt> option along these lines:
    <pre>
    apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
    kind: KubeletConfig
    metadata:
       name: kubelet-config-$pool
    spec:
        machineConfigPoolSelector:
            matchLabels:
                pools.operator.machineconfiguration.openshift.io/$pool_name: ""
        kubeletConfig:
            eventRecordQPS: {{{ xccdf_value("var_event_record_qps") }}}
    </pre>


warnings:
    - functionality: |-
        The MachineConfig Operator does not merge <tt>KubeletConfig</tt>
        objects, the last object is used instead. In case you need to
        set multiple options for kubelet, consider putting all the custom
        options into a single <tt>KubeletConfig</tt> object.

rationale: |-
    It is important to capture all events and not restrict event creation.
    Events are an important source of security information and analytics that
    ensure that your environment is consistently monitored using the event
    data.

severity: medium


ocil_clause: 'event creation limits are not configured'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the kubelet node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep eventRecordQPS /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf</pre>
    The output should return <tt>{{{ xccdf_value("var_event_record_qps") }}}</tt>.
