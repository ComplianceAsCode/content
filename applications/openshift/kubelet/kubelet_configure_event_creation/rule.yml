title: 'kubelet - Do Not Limit Event Creation'

description: |-
    All events should be captured and not restricted as this helps in
    reconstucting the chain-of-events.

    To prevent log creation limiting, edit the kubelet configuration
    file <tt>/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml</tt>
    on the kubelet node(s) and set the below parameter:
    <pre>event-qps=0</pre>

rationale: |-
    All events should be captured and not restricted as this helps in
    reconstucting the chain-of-events.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: 'events are limited'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the kubelet node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep -A1 event-qps /etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml</pre>
    The output should return <tt>0</tt>.
