title: 'kubelet - Disable Privileged Containers'

description: |-
    To disable privileged containers, edit the kubelet configuration file
    <tt>/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml</tt> on the kubelet node(s) and
    set the below parameter:
    <pre>  kubeletArguments:
      allow-privileged
      - false</pre>

rationale: |-
    When enabled, privileged containers have unrestricted access and should be
    disabled. A privileged continer will run with security mechanisms disabled
    which will put the system at risk.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: 'privileged containers are not disabled'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the kubelet node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep -A1 allow-privileged /etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml</pre>
    The output should return <tt>false</tt>.
