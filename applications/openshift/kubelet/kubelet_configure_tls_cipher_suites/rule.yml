title: "Ensure that the Kubelet only makes use of Strong Cryptographic Ciphers"

description: |-
  Ensure that the Kubelet is configured to only use strong cryptographic ciphers.

rationale: |-
  TLS ciphers have had a number of known vulnerabilities and weaknesses,
  which can reduce the protection provided by them. By default Kubernetes
  supports a number of TLS ciphersuites including some that have security
  concerns, weakening the protection provided.
