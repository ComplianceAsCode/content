title: 'kubelet - Do Not Disable Streaming Timeouts'

description: |-
    Timouts for streaming connections should not be disabled as they help to prevent
    denial-of-service attacks.
    To configure streaming connection timeouts, edit the kubelet configuration
    file <tt>/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml</tt>
    on the kubelet node(s) and set the below parameter:
    <pre>kubeletArguments:
      streaming-connection-idle-timeout:
      - '<sub idref="var_streaming_connection_timeouts"/>'</pre>

rationale: |-
    Ensuring connections have timeouts helps to protect against denial-of-service attacks as
    well as disconnect inactive connections. In addition, setting connections timeouts helps
    to prevent from running out of ephemeral ports. 

severity: medium

ocil_clause: 'the streaming connection timeouts are not disabled'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the kubelet node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep -A1 streaming-connection-idle-timeout /etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml</pre>
