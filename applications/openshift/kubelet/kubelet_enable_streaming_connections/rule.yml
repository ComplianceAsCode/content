title: 'kubelet - Do Not Disable Streaming Timeouts'

description: |-
    Timouts for streaming connections should not be disabled as they help to prevent
    denial-of-service attacks.
    To configure streaming connection timeouts, edit the kubelet configuration
    file <tt>/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf</tt>
    on the kubelet node(s) and set the below parameter:
    <pre>streamingConnectionIdleTimeout: {{{ xccdf_value("var_streaming_connection_timeouts") }}}</pre>

rationale: |-
    Ensuring connections have timeouts helps to protect against denial-of-service attacks as
    well as disconnect inactive connections. In addition, setting connections timeouts helps
    to prevent from running out of ephemeral ports.

severity: medium

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the kubelet node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep streamingConnectionIdleTimeout /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf</pre>
    The output should return <tt>{{{ xccdf_value("var_streaming_connection_timeouts") }}}</tt>.
