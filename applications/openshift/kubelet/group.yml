title: 'Kubernetes Kubelet Settings'

description: |-
    The Kubernetes Kubelet is an agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It
    makes sure that containers are running in a pod.

    The kubelet takes a set of PodSpecs that are provided through various
    mechanisms and ensures that the containers described in those PodSpecs are
    running and healthy. The kubelet doesnâ€™t manage containers which were not
    created by Kubernetes.
