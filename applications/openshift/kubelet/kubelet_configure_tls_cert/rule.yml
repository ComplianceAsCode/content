title: 'Ensure That The kubelet Client Certificate Is Correctly Set'

description: |-
    To ensure the kubelet TLS client certificate is configured, edit the
    kubelet configuration file <tt>/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml</tt>
    and configure the <tt>cert-dir</tt> path for the kubelet certificates.
    For example:
    <pre>  cert-dir:
      - /etc/origin/node/certificates</pre>
    A corresponding certificate should exist in the <tt>cert-dir</tt>. For
    example:
    <pre>/etc/origin/node/certificates/kubelet-client-current.pem</pre>

rationale: |-
    Without cryptographic integrity protections, information can be
    altered by unauthorized users without detection.
