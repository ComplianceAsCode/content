title: 'kubelet - Prevent Kernel Settings Modification'

description: |-
    By default, the kubelet has the ability to configure the kernel's settings and
    parameters potentially creating a security incident.
    To prevent the kubelet from changing kernel parameters, edit the kubelet configuration
    file <tt>/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml</tt>
    on the kubelet node(s) and set the below parameter:
    <pre>protect-kernel-defaults=true</pre>

rationale: |-
    Preventing the kubelet from modifying kernel parameters or tunables will ensure that
    system stays in its existing tuned and hardened state. Allowing kubelets to configure
    the kernel settings not only generates actionable audit records but also could open
    the system up to new vectors of attack.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: 'the kubelet cannot modify or tune kernel perameters and configurations'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the kubelet node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep -A1 protect-kernel-defaults /etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml</pre>
    The output should return <tt>true</tt>.
