title: 'kubelet - Configure the Client CA Certificate'

description: |-
    By default, the kubelet is not configured with a CA certificate which
    can subject the kubelet to man-in-the-middle attacks.

    To configure a client CA certificate, edit the kubelet configuration
    file <tt>/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml</tt>
    on the kubelet node(s) and set the below parameter:
    <pre>servingInfo:
      clientCA: client-ca.crt</pre>

rationale: |-
    Not having a CA certificate for the kubelet will subject the kubelet to possible
    man-in-the-middle attacks especially on unsafe or untrusted networks.
    Certificate validation for the kubelet allows the API server to validate
    the kubelet's identity. 

severity: medium

ocil_clause: 'no client CA certificate has been configured'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the kubelet node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep client-ca.crt /etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml</pre>
    The output should something similar to <tt>client-ca.crt</tt>.
