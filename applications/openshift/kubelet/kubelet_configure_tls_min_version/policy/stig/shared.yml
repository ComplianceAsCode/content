srg_requirement: |-
  {{{ full_name }}} must use TLS 1.2 or greater for
  secure communication.

vuldiscussion: |-
  The authenticity and integrity of the container platform and communication
  between nodes and components must be secure. If an insecure protocol
  is used during transmission of data, the data can be intercepted and
  manipulated. The manipulation of data can be used to inject status changes
  of the container platform, causing the execution of containers or reporting
  an incorrect healthcheck. To thwart the manipulation of the data during
  transmission, a secure protocol (TLS 1.2 or newer) must be used. Further
  guidance on secure transport protocols can be found in NIST SP 800-52.

checktext: |-
  Verify that the Kubelet TLS Security Profile is not set to old, or a custom
  profile that does not enforce TLS 1.2 or above.
  > oc get KubeletConfigs -o \
  jsonpath='{range .items[]} Name: {.metadata.name} Profile: {.spec.tlsSecurityProfile}{"\n"}'

  If the above returns a TLS profile of "Old", this is a finding.

  If the above returns a TLS profile of "Custom" and the minTLSVersion
  is not set to "VersionTLS12" or greater, this is a finding.

  Edit the KubeletConfig and set the TLS Security Profile to Intermediate
