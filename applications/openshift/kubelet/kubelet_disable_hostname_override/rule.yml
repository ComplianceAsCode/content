title: 'kubelet - Disable Hostname Override'

description: |-
    To prevent the hostname from being overrided, edit the kubelet systemd service file
    <tt>/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service</tt> on the kubelet node(s) and
    remove the <tt>--hostname-override</tt> flag if it exists.

rationale: |-
    Allowing hostnames to be overrided creates issues around resolving nodes
    in addition to TLS configuration, certificate validation, and log correlation
    and validation.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: 'the hostname cannot be overrided'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the kubelet node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep hostname-override /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service</pre>
    The output should return no output.
