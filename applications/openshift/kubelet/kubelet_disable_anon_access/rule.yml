title: 'kubelet - Disable Anonymous Access'

description: |-
    By default, anonymous access to the kubelet is enabled. This
    configuration check ensures that anonymous requests to the kubelet
    are disabled.

    Edit the kubelet configuration file <tt>/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml</tt>
    on the kubelet node(s) and set the below parameter:
    <pre>kubeletArguments:
      anonymous-auth:
      - 'false'</pre>

rationale: |-
    When enabled, requests that are not rejected by other configured
    authentication methods are treated as anonymous requests. OpenShift Operators should
    rely on authentication to authorize access and disallow anonymous
    requests.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: 'anonymous access is not disabled'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the kubelet node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep -A1 anonymous-auth /etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml</pre>
    The output should return <tt>false</tt>.
