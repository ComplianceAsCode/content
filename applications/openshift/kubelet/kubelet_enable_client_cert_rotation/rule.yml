title: 'kubelet - Enable Client Certificate Rotation'

description: |-
    To enable the kubelet to rotate client certificates, edit the kubelet configuration
    file <tt>/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml</tt>
    on the kubelet node(s) and set the below parameter:
    <pre>RotateKubeletClientCertificate=true</pre>

    Allowing the kubelet to auto-update the certificates ensure that there is no downtime
    in certificate renewal as well as ensures confidentiality and integrity.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: 'the kubelet cannot rotate client certificate'

    <pre>$ sudo grep -B1 RotateKubeletClientCertificate /etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml</pre>
    The output should return <tt>true</tt>.
