title: 'kubelet - Allow Automatic Firewall Configuration'

description: |-
    The kubelet has the ability to automatically configure the firewall to allow
    the containers required ports and connections to networking resources and destinations
    parameters potentially creating a security incident.
    To allow the kubelet to modify the firewall, edit the kubelet configuration
    file <tt>/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml</tt>
    on the kubelet node(s) and set the below parameter:
    <pre>kubeletArguments:
      make-iptables-util-chains:
      - 'true'</pre>

rationale: |-
    The kubelet should automatically configure the firewall settings to allow access and
    networking traffic through. This ensures that when a pod or container is running that
    the correct ports are configured as well as removing the ports when a pod or
    container is no longer in existence. 

severity: medium

ocil_clause: 'the kubelet cannot modify the firewall settings'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command on the kubelet node(s):
    <pre>$ sudo grep -A1 make-iptables-util-chains /etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml</pre>
    The output should return <tt>true</tt>.

warnings:
    - management: |-
        IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR ANY REASON to manually configure firewall ports for running
        pods and containers as this not only can create conflicts with firewall rules but can
        also introduce inconsistences into the allowed/disabled ports on the firewall.
