    {{{ full_name }}} must use TLS 1.2 or greater for secure container
    image transport from trusted sources.

vuldiscussion: |-
    The authenticity and integrity of the container image during the
    container image lifecycle is part of the overall security posture of
    the container platform. This begins with the container image creation
    and pull of a base image from a trusted source for child container
    image creation and the instantiation of the new image into a running
    service. If an insecure protocol is used during transmission of
    container images at any step of the lifecycle, a bad actor may inject
    nefarious code into the container image. The container image, when
    instantiated, then becomes a security risk to the container platform,
    the host server, and other containers within the container platform. To
    thwart the injection of code during transmission, a secure protocol
    (TLS 1.2 or newer) must be used. Further guidance on secure transport
    protocols can be found in NIST SP 800-52.

checktext: |-
   Verify that no insecure registries are configured:

   $ oc get image.config.openshift.io/cluster -o json | jq '.spec | (.allowedRegistriesForImport[])? | select(.insecure==true)'

   If the command produces any output, this is a finding.

fixtext: |-
  Remove any insecureRegistries configured using the following command by editing the registry configuration:
  $ oc edit image.config.openshift.io/cluster
