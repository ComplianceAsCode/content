title: "Allowed registries are configured"

description: |-
    The configuration <tt>registrySources.allowedRegistries</tt> determines the
    permitted registries that the OpenShift container runtime can access for builds
    and pods. This configuration setting ensures that all registries other than
    those specified are blocked.

rationale: |-
    Allowed registries should be configured to restrict the registries that the
    OpenShift container runtime can access, and all other registries should be
    blocked.
