title: "Configure ImagePruner so that images that are no longer needed are automatically removed"

description: |-
  <p>
  Images from the internal registry that are no longer required by the system due to age, status,
  or exceed limits are automatically pruned. Cluster administrators can configure the Pruning Custom Resource, or suspend it. 
  </p>
  <p>
  For more information on configuring the ImagePruner, consult the
  OpenShift documentation:
  {{{ weblink(link="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/latest/html/building_applications/pruning-objects") }}}
  </p>


rationale: |-
  <p>
  Obsolete and stale images need to be removed from the registry to ensure
  the container platform maintains a secure posture. While the storing of
  these images does not directly pose a threat, they do increase the likelihood
  of these images being deployed.
  </p>
  <p>
  Removing stale or obsolete images and only keeping the most recent versions
  of those that are still in use removes any possibility of vulnerable images being deployed.

  Ensure that the imagepruner is configured and is not in a suspended state.

  The output should be non-empty and the <tt>.spec.suspend</tt> field should not be set to false.
