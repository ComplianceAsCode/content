title: "Allowed registries for import are configured"

description: |-
    The configuration <tt>allowedRegistriesForImport</tt> limits the container
    image registries from which normal users may import images. This is important
    to control, as a user who can stand up a malicious registry can then import
    content which claims to include the SHAs of legimitate content layers.

rationale: |-
    Allowed registries for import should be specified to limit the registries 
    from which users may import images.
