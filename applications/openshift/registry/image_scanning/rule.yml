description: |-
  Scan images being deployed to Amazon EKS for vulnerabilities.

  Vulnerabilities in software packages can be exploited by hackers or malicious
  users to obtain unauthorized access to local cloud resources. Amazon ECR and
  other third party products allow images to be scanned for known
  vulnerabilities.

  Please follow AWS ECS or your 3rd party image scanning provider's guidelines
  for enabling Image Scanning.

  Remediation:

  To utilize AWS ECR for Image scanning please follow the steps below:

  To create a repository configured for scan on push (AWS CLI)

  <tt>aws ecr create-repository --repository-name <i>$REPO_NAME</i> --image-scanning- configuration scanOnPush=true --region <i>$REGION_CODE</i></tt>

  To edit the settings of an existing repository (AWS CLI)

  <tt>aws ecr put-image-scanning-configuration --repository-name <i>$REPO_NAME</i> -- image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true --region <i>$REGION_CODE</i></tt>

  Use the following steps to start a manual image scan using the AWS Management Console.

  1. Open the Amazon ECR console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories.
  2. From the navigation bar, choose the Region to create your repository in.
  3. In the navigation pane, choose Repositories.
  4. On the Repositories page, choose the repository that contains the image to scan.
  5. On the Images page, select the image to scan and then choose Scan.
