  {{{ full_name }}} must use a centralized user management solution to
  support account management functions.

vuldiscussion: |-
  OpenShift supports several different types of identity providers.  In order to add users and grant access to OpenShift, an identity provider must be configured. Some of the identity provider types, such as HTPassword, only provide simple user management and are not intended for production. Other types are public services, like GitHub. These provider types are not appropriate as they are managed by public service providers and therefore are unable to enforce the organizations account management requirements.

  Use either the LDAP or the OpenIDConnect Identity Provider type to configure OpenShift to use the organizations centrally managed IdP that is able to enforce the organization's policies in regard to user identity management.

  Verify the authentication operator is configure to use either an LDAP or a OpenIDConnect provider by executing the following:

  oc get oauth cluster -o jsonpath="{.spec.identityProviders[*].type}{'\n'}"

  If the output lists any other type besides LDAP or OpenID, this is a finding.

  Configure OpenShift to use an appropriate Identity Provider. Do not use HTPasswd. Use either LDAP(AD), OpenIDConnect or an approved identity provider.

  Steps to configure LDAP provider:
  1. Create Secret for BIND DN password by executing the following:

  oc create secret generic ldap-secret --from-literal=bindPassword=<secret> -n openshift-config 

  2. Create config map for LDAP Trust CA by executing the following:
 
  oc create configmap ca-config-map --from-file=ca.crt=/path/to/ca -n openshift-config

  3. Create LDAP Auth Config Resource YAML:
  Using your preferred text editor, create a file named ldapidp.yaml using the example content. (replacing config values as appropriate)
 
  apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
  kind: OAuth
  metadata:
    name: cluster
  spec:
    identityProviders:
    - name: ldapidp 
      mappingMethod: claim 
      type: LDAP
      ldap:
        attributes:
          id: 
          - dn
          email: 
          - mail
          name: 
          - cn
          preferredUsername: 
          - uid
        bindDN: <"bindDN">
        bindPassword: 
          name: ldap-secret
        ca: 
          name: ca-config-map
        insecure: false 
        url: <URL> 

  4. Apply LDAP config to cluster by executing the following:
  
  oc apply -f ldapidp.yaml
 
  NOTE: For more information on configuring an LDAP provider refer to the documentation: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/identity_providers/configuring-ldap-identity-provider.html
 
  Steps to configure OpenID provider:
 
  1. Create Secret for Client Secret by executing the following:
 
  oc create secret generic idp-secret --from-literal=clientSecret=<secret> -n openshift-config
 
  2. Create config map for OpenID Trust CA by executing the following:
 
  oc create configmap ca-config-map --from-file=ca.crt=/path/to/ca -n openshift-config

  3. Create OpenID Auth Config Resource YAML.
  Using your preferred text editor, create a file named oidcidp.yaml using the example content. (replacing config values as appropriate)

  apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
  kind: OAuth
  metadata:
    name: cluster
  spec:
    identityProviders:
    - name: oidcidp
      mappingMethod: claim
      type: OpenID
      openID:
        clientID: <clientID>
        clientSecret:
          name: oidc-idp-secret
        claims:
          preferredUsername:
          - preferred_username
          name:
          - name
          email:
          - email
        ca:
          name: ca-config-map
        issuer: <URL>
  
  4. Apply OpenID config to cluster by executing the following:
 
  oc apply -f ldapidp.yaml
 
  NOTE: For more information on configuring an OpenID provider refer to the documentation: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/identity_providers/configuring-oidc-identity-provider.html
