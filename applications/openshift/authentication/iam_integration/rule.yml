title: 'Manage Users with AWS IAM'

description: |-
  Amazon EKS uses IAM to provide authentication to your Kubernetes cluster
  through the AWS IAM Authenticator for Kubernetes. You can configure the stock
  kubectl client to work with Amazon EKS by installing the AWS IAM
  Authenticator for Kubernetes and modifying your kubectl configuration file to
  use it for authentication.

rationale: |-
  On- and off-boarding users is often difficult to automate and prone to error.
  Using a single source of truth for user permissions reduces the number of
  locations that an individual must be off-boarded from, and prevents users
  gaining unique permissions sets that increase the cost of audit.

  <b>Audit:</b>

  To Audit access to the namespace $NAMESPACE, assume the IAM role
  yourIAMRoleName for a user that you created, and then run the following
  command:

  <tt>$ kubectl get role -n <i>$NAMESPACE</i></tt>
  The response lists the RBAC role that has access to this Namespace.

  <b>Remediation:</b>
  
  Refer to the 'Managing users or IAM roles for your cluster' in Amazon EKS
  documentation.
