title: 'Limit Access to the Host Network Namespace'

description: |-
    Containers should not be allowed access to the host's network
    namespace. To prevent containers from getting access to a host's
    network namespace, the appropriate Security Context Constraints (SCCs)
    should set <tt>allowHostNetwork</tt> to <tt>false</tt>.

rationale: |-
    A container running in the host's network namespace could
    access the host network traffic to and from other pods
    potentially allowing an attacker to exploit pods and network
    traffic.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: 'allowHostNetwork is set to true or too many SCCs have allowHostNetwork enabled'

ocil: |-
    Inspect each SCC returned from running the following command:
    <pre>$ oc get scc</pre>
    Review each SCC and determine that <tt>allowHostNetwork</tt> is either
    completely disabled, or that <tt>allowHostNetwork</tt> is only enabled to
    a small set of containers and SCCs.
