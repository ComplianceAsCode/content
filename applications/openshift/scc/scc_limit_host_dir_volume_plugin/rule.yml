title: 'Limit Containers Ability to use the HostDir volume plugin'

description: |-
    Containers should be allowed to use the <tt>hostPath</tt> volume type unless
    necessary. To prevent containers from using the host filesystem
    the appropriate Security Context Constraints (SCCs) should set
    <tt>allowHostDirVolumePlugin</tt> to <tt>false</tt>.

rationale: |-
    <tt>hostPath</tt> volumes allow workloads to access the host filesystem
    from the workload. Access to the host filesystem can be used to
    escalate privileges and access resources such as keys or access
    tokens.

ocil_clause: 'allowHostDirVolumePlugin usage in SCCs needs review'

ocil: |-
    Inspect each SCC returned from running the following command:
    <pre>$ oc get scc</pre>
    Review each SCC for those that have <tt>allowHostDirVolumePlugin</tt>
    set to <tt>true</tt>.  Next, examine the outputs of the following commands:
    <pre>$ oc describe roles --all-namespaces</pre>
    <pre>$ oc describe clusterroles</pre>
    For any role/clusterrole that reference the
    <tt>securitycontextconstraints</tt> resource with the <tt>resourceNames</tt>
    of the SCCs that have <tt>allowHostDirVolumePlugin</tt>, examine the associated
    rolebindings to account for the users that are bound to the role. Review the
    account to determine if <tt>allowHostDirVolumePlugin</tt> is truly required.
