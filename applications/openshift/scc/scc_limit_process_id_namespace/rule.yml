title: 'Limit Access to the Host Process ID Namespace'

description: |-
    Containers should not be allowed access to the host's process
    ID namespace. To prevent containers from getting access to a host's
    process ID namespace, the appropriate Security Context Constraints (SCCs)
    should set <tt>allowHostPID</tt> to <tt>false</tt>.

rationale: |-
    A container running in the host's PID namespace can inspect
    processes running outside the container which can be used to
    escalate privileges outside of the container.

severity: medium

references:
    cis: 5.2.2

ocil_clause: 'allowHostPID is set to true or too many SCCs have allowHostPID enabled'

ocil: |-
    Inspect each SCC returned from running the following command:
    <pre>$ oc get scc</pre>
    Review each SCC and determine that <tt>allowHostPID</tt> is either
    completely disabled, or that <tt>allowHostPID</tt> is only enabled to
    a small set of containers and SCCs.
