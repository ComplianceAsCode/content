title: 'Limit Containers Ability to Escalate Privileges'

description: |-
    Containers should be limited to only the privileges required
    to run and should not be allowed to escalate their privileges.
    To prevent containers from escalating privileges,
    the appropriate Security Context Constraints (SCCs)
    should set <tt>allowPrivilegeEscalation</tt> to <tt>false</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Privileged containers have access to more of the Linux Kernel
    capabilities and devices. If a privileged container were
    compromised, an attacker would have full access to the container
    and host.

ocil_clause: 'allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to true or too many SCCs have allowPrivilegeEscalation enabled'

ocil: |-
    Inspect each SCC returned from running the following command:
    <pre>$ oc get scc</pre>
    Review each SCC and determine that <tt>allowPrivilegeEscalation</tt> is either
    completely disabled, or that <tt>allowPrivilegeEscalation</tt> is only enabled to
    a small set of containers and SCCs.
