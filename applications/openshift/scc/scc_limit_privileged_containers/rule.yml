title: 'Limit Privileged Container Use'

description: |-
    Containers should be limited to only the privileges required
    to run. To prevent containers from running as privileged containers,
    the appropriate Security Context Constraints (SCCs) should set
    <tt>allowPrivilegedContainer</tt> to <tt>false</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Privileged containers have access to all Linux Kernel
    capabilities and devices. If a privileged container were
    compromised, an attacker would have full access to the container
    and host.

severity: medium

    cis: 5.2.1

ocil_clause: 'allowPrivilegedContainer is set to true or too many SCCs have allowPrivilegedContainer enabled'

ocil: |-
    Inspect each SCC returned from running the following command:
    <pre>$ oc get scc</pre>
    Review each SCC and determine that <tt>allowPrivilegedContainer</tt> is either
    completely disabled, or that <tt>allowPrivilegedContainer</tt> is only enabled to
    a small set of containers and SCCs.
