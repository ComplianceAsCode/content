title: 'Limit Access to the Host IPC Namespace'

description: |-
    Containers should not be allowed access to the host's Interprocess Commication (IPC)
    namespace. To prevent containers from getting access to a host's
    IPC namespace, the appropriate Security Context Constraints (SCCs)
    should set <tt>allowHostIPC</tt> to <tt>false</tt>.

rationale: |-
    A container running in the host's IPC namespace can use IPC
    to interact with processes outside the container potentially
    allowing an attacker to exploit a host process thereby enabling an
    attacker to exploit other services.

ocil_clause: 'allowHostIPC usage in SCCs needs review'

ocil: |-
    Inspect each SCC returned from running the following command:
    <pre>$ oc get scc</pre>
    Review each SCC for those that have <tt>allowHostIPC</tt> set to <tt>true</tt>.
    Next, examine the outputs of the following commands:
    <pre>$ oc describe roles --all-namespaces</pre>
    <pre>$ oc describe clusterroles</pre>
    For any role/clusterrole that reference the
    <tt>securitycontextconstraints</tt> resource with the <tt>resourceNames</tt>
    of the SCCs that have <tt>allowHostIPC</tt>, examine the associated
    rolebindings to account for the users that are bound to the role. Review the
    account to determine if <tt>allowHostIPC</tt> is truly required.
