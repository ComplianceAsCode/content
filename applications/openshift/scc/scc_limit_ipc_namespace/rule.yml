title: 'Limit Access to the Host IPC Namespace'

description: |-
    Containers should not be allowed access to the host's Interprocess Commication (IPC)
    namespace. To prevent containers from getting access to a host's
    IPC namespace, the appropriate Security Context Constraints (SCCs)
    should set <tt>allowHostIPC</tt> to <tt>false</tt>.

rationale: |-
    A container running in the host's IPC namespace can use IPC
    to interact with processes outside the container potentially
    allowing an attacker to exploit a host process thereby enabling an
    attacker to exploit other services.

ocil_clause: 'allowHostIPC is set to true or too many SCCs have allowHostIPC enabled'

ocil: |-
    Inspect each SCC returned from running the following command:
    <pre>$ oc get scc</pre>
    Review each SCC and determine that <tt>allowHostIPC</tt> is either
    completely disabled, or that <tt>allowHostIPC</tt> is only enabled to
    a small set of containers and SCCs.
