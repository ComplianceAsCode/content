title: 'Verify User Who Owns The OpenShift PKI Private Key Files'

description: |-
  {{{ describe_file_owner(file="/etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/*/*/*/*.key", owner="root") }}}

rationale: |-
  OpenShift makes use of a number of certificates as part of its operation.
  You should verify the ownership of the directory containing the PKI
  information and all files in that directory to maintain their integrity.
  The directory and files should be owned by root:root.

# Note that this recursively checks for files, and the form is as follows:
#
#  /etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/.*/.*/.*/.*\.key
#
# Taking as an example:
#
#  /etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/kube-apiserver-pod-3/secrets/kubelet-client/tls.key
#
# - /etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/ is the base path
# - 'kube-apiserver-pod-3' This initial versioned resourced directory (e.g. pod version)
# - 'secrets' The type of resource (e.g. configmap or secret)
# - 'kubelet-client' the mount name
# - 'tls.key' the file
