title: 'Verify User Who Owns The OpenShift PKI Certificate Files'

description: |-
  {{{ describe_file_owner(file="/etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/*/*/*/tls.crt", owner="root") }}}

rationale: |-
  OpenShift makes use of a number of certificates as part of its operation.
  You should verify the ownership of the directory containing the PKI
  information and all files in that directory to maintain their integrity.

# Note that this recursively checks for files, and the form is as follows:
#
#  /etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/.*/.*/.*/tls\.key
#
# Taking as an example:
#
#  /etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/kube-controller-manager-pod-7/secrets/serving-cert/tls.crt
#
# - /etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/ is the base path
# - 'kube-controller-manager-pod-7' This initial versioned resourced directory (e.g. pod version)
# - 'secrets' The type of resource (e.g. configmap or secret)
# - 'serving-cert' the mount name
# - 'tls.crt' the cert file
