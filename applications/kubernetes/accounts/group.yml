title: 'OpenShift - Account and Access Control'

description: |-
    In traditional Unix security, if an attacker gains
    shell access to a certain login account, they can perform any action
    or access any file to which that account has access. The same
    idea applies to cloud technology such as OpenShift. Therefore,
    making it more difficult for unauthorized people to gain shell
    access to accounts, particularly to privileged accounts, is a
    necessary part of securing a system. This section introduces
    mechanisms for restricting access to accounts under
    OpenShift.
