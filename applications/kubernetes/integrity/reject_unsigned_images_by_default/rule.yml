title: Ensure the Container Runtime rejects unsigned images by default

platforms:
  - ocp4-node

description: |-
  <p>
  The OpenShift Platform allows for verifying the signature of a container
  image before pulling it. this is done via the policy.json file [1]
  which needs to be configured via the Machine Config Operator [2].
  </p>
  <p>
  Ensure that the default policy is "reject" in <tt>/etc/containers/policy.json</tt>,
  which should look as follows:

  <pre>
    {
      "default": [{"type": "reject"}],
      "transports":
      ...
    }
  </pre>

  Addition of allowed registries must be an explicit action to ensure that only
  containers from allowed registries are used.

rationale: |-
  By ensuring that the container runtime verifies the integrity of container images
  before pulling them one is able to prevent a malicious actor from introducing
  unauthorized images into the deployment.

  Subsequently, run the following command:

  <pre>cat /etc/containers/policy.json</pre>

  Make sure that the default policy to verify container images is set to reject.
  This should look as follows:

  <pre>
    {
      "default": [{"type": "reject"}],
      "transports":
      ...
    }
  </pre>
