title: 'Manage Image Provenance Using ImagePolicyWebhook'

description: |-
    OpenShift administrators can control which images can be imported, tagged, and run in a cluster.
    There are two facilities for this purpose: (1) Allowed Registries, allowing administrators to
    restrict image origins to known external registries; and (2) ImagePolicy Admission plug-in which lets
    administrators specify specific images which are allowed to run on the OpenShift cluster.

    Configure an Image policy per the Image Policy chapter in the OpenShift documentation:
    {{{ weblink(link="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/openshift_images/image-configuration.html") }}}

rationale: |-
    Image Policy ensures that only approved container images are allowed to be ran on the OpenShift platform.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: 'an image policy is not configured'

ocil: |-

    returned from the following command:
