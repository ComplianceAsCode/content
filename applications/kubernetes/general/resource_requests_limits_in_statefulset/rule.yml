title: Ensure that all statefulsets has resource limits

description: |-
  When deploying an application, it is important to tune based on memory and CPU consumption,
  allocating enough resources for the application to function properly. Images provided by
  OpenShift Dedicated behave properly within the confines of the memory they are allocated.
  However, any applicaiton images must pay attention to the specific resources required to
  ensure they are available.

  If the node where a Pod is running has enough of a resource available, it's possible (and allowed)
  for a container to use more resource than its request for that resource specifies.
  However, a container is not allowed to use more than its resource limit.

# todo : better if we can keep openshift document link for this reference,

rationale: |-
  Resource requests/limits provide constraints that limit aggregate resource consumption
  per container. This helps prevent resource starvation. When deploying your
  application, it is important to tune based on memory and CPU consumption,
  allocating enough resources for the application to function properly.

    Run the following command to retrieve a list of statefulsets that does not have resource requests and limits:
    <pre>$  oc get statefulset.apps --all-namespaces -o json  | jq '{{{ jqfilter }}}'</pre>
    Make sure that there is output nothing in the result.
