title: Ensure that cluster-wide proxy is set

description: |-
  <p>
  Production environments can deny direct access to the Internet and instead have
  an HTTP or HTTPS proxy available.
  </p>
  <p>
  The Proxy object is used to manage the cluster-wide egress proxy. Setting this
  will ensure that containers get the appropriate environment variables set
  to ensure traffic goes to the proxy per organizational requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
  For more information, see {{{ weblink(link="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/networking/enable-cluster-wide-proxy.html",
                                        text="the relevant documentation.") }}}
  </p>

rationale: |-
  External networks tend to be outside of organizational control. By ensuring
  that egress traffic goes through an authorized proxy, one is able to ensure
  that expected and safe traffic is coming out, and malicious actors
  aren't leaking sensitive information, or calling back from a central command
  center to get further instructions upon intrusion.
