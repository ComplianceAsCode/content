title: Enable audit Logs

description: |-
  The audit logs are part of the EKS managed Kubernetes control plane logs that
  are managed by Amazon EKS. Amazon EKS is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a
  service that provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS
  service in Amazon EKS. CloudTrail captures all API calls for Amazon EKS as
  events. The calls captured include calls from the Amazon EKS console and code
  calls to the Amazon EKS API operations.

rationale: |-
  Exporting logs and metrics to a dedicated, persistent datastore such as
  CloudTrail ensures availability of audit data following a cluster security
  event, and provides a central location for analysis of log and metric data
  collated from multiple sources.

  Perform the following to determine if CloudTrail is enabled for all regions:
  Via the Management Console
  <ol>
    <li>Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the EKS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/eks</li>
    <li>Click on Cluster Name of the cluster you are auditing</li>
    <li>Click Logging</li>
    <li>Ensure all 5 choices are set to Enabled</li>
  </ol>
  If any of the choices are disabled, this is a finding.

  Via the CLI
  <tt>aws --region "<i>${REGION_CODE}</i>" eks describe-cluster --name "<i>${CLUSTER_NAME}</i>" --query 'cluster.logging.clusterLogging[?enabled==true].types'</tt>
  If no results are returned, this is a finding.
