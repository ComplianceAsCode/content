title: Ensure roles are defined in the cluster

description: |-
  <p>
  RBAC is a critical feature in terms of security for Kubernetes and
  OpenShift. It enables administrators to segment the privileges
  granted to a service account, and thus allows us to limit the
  access to resources that they get. By defining roles appropriately
  one is able to codify organizational policy. [1]

  </p>

rationale: |-
  By defining RBAC roles, one is able to limit the permissions
  given to a Service Account, and thus limit the blast radius
  that an account compromise would have.
