title: 'Kubernetes Settings'

description: |-
  Each section of this guide includes recommendations for hardening Kubernetes
  distributions. For each hardening recommendation, information on how to
  implement the control and how to verify or audit the control is provided. In
  some cases, remediation information is also provided.

  Some recommendations in this guide are in place by default. The audit
  information for these settings is provided to verify the cluster
  administrator has not made changes that would be less secure then the
  defaults. A small number of items require configuration.

  Finally, there are some recommendations that require decisions by the system
  operator, such as audit log size, retention, and related settings.
