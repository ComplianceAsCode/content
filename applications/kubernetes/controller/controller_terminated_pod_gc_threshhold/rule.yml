title: 'Enable terminated-pod-gc-threshold for the Controller Manager'

description: |-
    To ensure the garbage collector is activated upon pod termination,
    set the <tt>terminated-pod-gc-threshold</tt> option to <tt>12500</tt>
    or a value greater than zeroin the <tt>openshift-kube-controller-manager</tt>
    configmap on the master node(s):
    <pre>
    "extendedArguments": {
    ...
      "terminated-pod-gc-threshold": [
        "12500"
      ],
    ...
    </pre>

rationale: |-
    Garbage collection is important to ensure sufficient resource availability
    and avoiding degraded performance and availability. In the worst case,
    the system might crash or just be unusable for a long period of time. The
    default setting for garbage collection is 12,500 terminated pods which
    might be to high for your system to sustain. Based on your system resources
    and tests, choose an appropriate threshold value to activate garbage
    collection.

ocil: |-
    To verify that <tt>terminated-pod-gc-threshold</tt> is configured correctly,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ oc get configmaps config -n openshift-kube-controller-manager -ojson | jq -r '.data["config.yaml"]' | jq -r '.extendedArguments["terminated-pod-gc-threshold"]'</pre>
    The returned value of <tt>terminated-pod-gc-threshold</tt> should be greater than zero.
