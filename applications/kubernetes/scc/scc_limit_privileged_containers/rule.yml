title: 'Limit Privileged Container Use'

description: |-
    Containers should be limited to only the privileges required
    to run. To prevent containers from running as privileged containers,
    the appropriate Security Context Constraints (SCCs) should set
    <tt>allowPrivilegedContainer</tt> to <tt>false</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Privileged containers have access to all Linux Kernel
    capabilities and devices. If a privileged container were
    compromised, an attacker would have full access to the container
    and host.

ocil_clause: 'allowPrivilegedContainer usage in SCCs needs review'

ocil: |-
    Inspect each SCC returned from running the following command:
    <pre>$ oc get scc</pre>
    Review each SCC for those that have <tt>allowPrivilegedContainer</tt> set to <tt>true</tt>.
    Next, examine the outputs of the following commands:
    <pre>$ oc describe roles --all-namespaces</pre>
    <pre>$ oc describe clusterroles</pre>
    For any role/clusterrole that reference the
    <tt>securitycontextconstraints</tt> resource with the <tt>resourceNames</tt>
    of the SCCs that have <tt>allowPrivilegedContainer</tt>, examine the associated
    rolebindings to account for the users that are bound to the role. Review the
    account to determine if <tt>allowPrivilegedContainer</tt> is truly required.
