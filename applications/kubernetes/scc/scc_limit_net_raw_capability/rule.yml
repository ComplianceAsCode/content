title: 'Limit Use of the CAP_NET_RAW'

description: |-
    Containers should not enable more capabilites than needed as this
    opens the door for malicious use. <tt>CAP_NET_RAW</tt> enables a container
    to launch a network attack on another container or cluster. To disable the
    <tt>CAP_NET_RAW</tt> capability, the appropriate Security Context Constraints (SCCs)
    should set <tt>NET_RAW</tt> in <tt>requiredDropCapabilities</tt>.

rationale: |-
    By default, containers run with a default set of capabilities as assigned
    by the Container Runtime which can include dangerous or highly privileged
    capabilities. If the CAP_NET_RAW is enabled, it may be misused
    by malicious containers or attackers.

ocil_clause: 'NET_RAW use in SCCs needs review'

ocil: |-
    Inspect each SCC returned from running the following command:
    <pre>$ oc get scc</pre>
    Review each SCC for those that do not have <tt>NET_RAW</tt> or <tt>ALL</tt> set under <tt>requiredDropCapabilities</tt>.
    Next, examine the outputs of the following commands:
    <pre>$ oc describe roles --all-namespaces</pre>
    <pre>$ oc describe clusterroles</pre>
    For any role/clusterrole that reference the
    <tt>securitycontextconstraints</tt> resource with the <tt>resourceNames</tt>
    of the SCCs that do not drop <tt>NET_RAW</tt> or <tt>ALL</tt>, examine the
    associated rolebindings to account for the users that are bound to the role.
    Review each SCC and determine that either <tt>NET_RAW</tt> or <tt>ALL</tt>
    is either included as a list entry under <tt>requiredDropCapabilities</tt>,
    or that either <tt>NET_RAW</tt> or <tt>ALL</tt> is only enabled to a small
    set of containers and SCCs.
