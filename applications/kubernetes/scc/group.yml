title: 'Security Context Constraints (SCC)'

description: |-
    Similar to the way that RBAC resources control user access,
    administrators can use Security Context Constraints (SCCs)
    to control permissions for pods. These permissions include
    actions that a pod, a collection of containers, can perform
    and what resources it can access. You can use SCCs to define
    a set of conditions that a pod must run with in order to be
    accepted into the system.
