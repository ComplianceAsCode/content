title: 'Disable Autofill Form Assistance'

description: |-
    Firefox provides tools to auto-fill forms from prefilled information.
    This can be disabled by setting <tt>browser.formfill.enable</tt> to
    <tt>false</tt>.

rationale: |-
    In order to protect privacy and sensitive data, Firefox provides
    the ability to configure Firefox such that data entered into forms
    is not saved. This mitigates the risk of a website gleaning private
    information from prefilled information.

    To verify that Autofill Form Assistance is disabled,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'browser.formfill.enable' <i>FIREFOX_INSTALL_DIR</i>/*.cfg</pre>
    The output should return:
    <pre>lockPref("browser.formfill.enable", false);</pre>
