title: 'Supported Version of Firefox Installed'

description: |-
    If the system is joined to the Red Hat Network, a Red Hat Satellite Server,
    or a yum server, run the following command to install updates:
    <pre>$ sudo yum update</pre>
    If the system is not configured to use one of these sources, updates (in the form of RPM packages)
    can be manually downloaded and installed using <tt>rpm</tt>.

rationale: |-
    Use of versions of an application which are not supported by the vendor
    are not permitted. Vendors respond to security flaws with updates and
    patches. These updates are not available for unsupported version which
    can leave the application vulnerable to attack.

ocil_clause: 'it is not updated'

ocil: |-
    If the system is joined to the Red Hat Network, a Red Hat Satellite Server, or
    a yum server which provides updates, invoking the following command will
    indicate if updates are available:
    <pre>$ sudo yum check-update</pre>
    If the system is not configured to update from one of these sources,
    run the following command to list when each package was last updated:
    <pre>$ rpm -qa -last</pre>
    Compare this to Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSA) listed at
    {{{ weblink(link="https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/active/") }}}
    to determine if the system is missing applicable updates.
