title: 'Enable Shared System Certificates'

description: |-
    The Shared System Certificates store makes NSS, GnuTLS, OpenSSL, and Java
    share a default source for retrieving system certificate anchors and blacklist
    information. Firefox has the capability of using this centralized store for its
    CA certificates. If the Shared System Certificates store is disabled, it can
    be enabled by running the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo update-ca-trust enable</pre>

rationale: |-
    The DOD root certificate will ensure that the trust chain is
    established for server certificates issued from the DOD CA.

    To verify that the central system cerificate authority store is enabled,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ ls -l /etc/alternatives/libnssckbi.so.x86_64</pre>
    The output should return something similar to:
    <pre>lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 34 Apr 30 09:19 /etc/alternatives/libnssckbi.so.x86_64 -&gt; /usr/lib64/pkcs11/p11-kit-trust.so</pre>
