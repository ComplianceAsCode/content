title: 'The DoD Root Certificate Exists'

    The DoD root certificate should be installed in the Shared System Certificates store
    for Firefox to be able to access the DoD certificate. To install the root certificated
    into the Shared System Certificates store, copy the DoD root certificate into
    <tt>/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors</tt>. Once the file is copied, run the following
    command:
    <pre>$ sudo update-ca-trust extract</pre>

rationale: |-
    The DOD root certificate will ensure that the trust chain is
    established for server certificates issued from the DOD CA.
