title: 'Disable User Ability To Autofill Passwords'

description: |-
    Firefox automatically allows users to save passwords to be auto-filled
    into password forms. This can be disabled by setting
    <tt>signon.autofillForms</tt> to <tt>false</tt>.

rationale: |-
    While on the internet, it may be possible for an attacker to view
    the saved password files and gain access to the user's accounts on
    various hosts.

    To verify that password autofill is disabled,
    run the following command:
    <pre>$ grep 'signon.autofillForms' <i>FIREFOX_INSTALL_DIR</i>/*.cfg</pre>
    The output should return:
    <pre>lockPref("signon.autofillForms", false);</pre>
