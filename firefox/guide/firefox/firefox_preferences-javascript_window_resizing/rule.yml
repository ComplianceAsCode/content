title: 'Disable JavaScript''s Moving Or Resizing Windows Capability'

description: |-
    JavaScript can configure and make changes to the web browser's appearance by
    specifically moving and resizing browser windows. This can be disabled by
    setting <tt>dom.disable_window_move_resize</tt> to <tt>true</tt>.

rationale: |-
    JavaScript can make changes to the browserâ€™s appearance. This activity
    can help disguise an attack taking place in a minimized background window.

    The output should return:
    <pre>lockPref("dom.disable_window_move_resize", "true");</pre>
