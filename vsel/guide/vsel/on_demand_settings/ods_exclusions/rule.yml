title: 'The McAfee VirusScan Enterprise for Linux 1.9.x/2.0.x On-Demand scanner must only be configured with exclusions that are documented and approved by the ISSO/ISSM/AO'

description: |-
    When scanning for malware, excluding specific files will increase the risk of a malware-infected file going undetected. 
    
    To check that VSEL settings are configured correctly, connect to the McAfee VirusScan Enterprise for Linux (VSEL) Monitor (WEB interface) 
    of the Linux system being reviewed from a desktop browser window and logon with the nails user account.
    
    In the VSEL WEB Monitor, review tasks under <tt>View</tt>, <tt>Scheduled Tasks</tt>.
    With the System Administrator's assistance, determine which task is intended as the regularly scheduled scan task.
    Click on the task, and then click <tt>Modify</tt>.
    Under <tt>2. What to Scan</tt>, click <tt>Next</tt>.
    Under <tt>3. Choose Scan Settings</tt>, <tt>Paths Excluded From Scanning</tt>.
    
    If any paths other than the following paths are excluded, and the exclusions have not been documented and approved by the ISSO/ISSM/AO, this is a finding.
    
    <tt>/var/log</tt>
    <tt>/_admin/Manage_NSS</tt>
    <tt>/mnt/system/log</tt>
    <tt>/media/nss/.*/(\._NETWARE|\._ADMIN)</tt>
    <tt>/.*\.(vmdk|VMDK|dbl|DBL|ctl|CTL|log|LOG|jar|JAR|war|WAR|dtx|DTX|dbf|DBF|frm|FRM|myd|MYD|myi|MYI|rdo|RDO|arc|ARC)</tt>
    <tt>/cgroup</tt>
    <tt>/dev</tt>
    <tt>/proc</tt>
    <tt>/selinux</tt>
    <tt>/sys</tt>

rationale: |-
    By configuring anti-virus software without any exclusions, the scanner has a higher success rate at detecting and eradicating malware.
