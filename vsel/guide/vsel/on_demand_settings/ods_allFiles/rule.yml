title: 'The McAfee VirusScan Enterprise for Linux 1.9.x/2.0.x On-Demand scanner must be configured to scan all file types'

description: |-
    When scanning for malware, excluding specific file types will increase the risk of a malware-infected file going undetected.  

    To check that VSEL settings are configured correctly, you have to examine the config file
    available under <tt>/var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/ods.cfg</tt>.
    If this config file contains the line <tt>nailsd.profile.ODS.allFiles: true</tt>,
    all file types will be scanned.

rationale: |-
    By configuring anti-virus software to scan all file types, the scanner has a higher success rate at detecting and eradicating malware.
