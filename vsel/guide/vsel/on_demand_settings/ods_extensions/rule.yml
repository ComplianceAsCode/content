title: 'The McAfee VirusScan Enterprise for Linux 1.9.x/2.0.x On-Demand scanner must be configured to include all local drives and their sub-directories'

description: |-
    When scanning for malware, excluding specific file types will increase the risk of a malware-infected file going undetected. By configuring anti-virus software to scan all file types, the scanner has a higher success rate at detecting and eradicating malware.

    To check that VSEL settings are configured correctly, you have to examine the config file
    available under <tt>/var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/ods.cfg</tt>.
    If this config file contains a line with "extensions.mode" with values set to anything other than <tt>extensions.mode: all</tt>, 
    associated scans may ignore certain file extensions.

rationale: |-
    Excluding file types from scans introduces the possibility for infected files to go undetected by the scanner.

    To verify that various extensions are not ignored by the scanner, 
    check the respective VSEL config file
    <pre>/var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/ods.cfg</pre> contains lines with <pre>extensions.mode: all</pre>:
    <pre>grep 'extensions.mode: all' /var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/ods.cfg</pre>
