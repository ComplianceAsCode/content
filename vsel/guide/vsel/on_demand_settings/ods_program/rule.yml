title: 'The McAfee VirusScan Enterprise for Linux 1.9.x/2.0.x On-Demand scanner must be configured to find potentially unwanted programs'

description: |-
    Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs) include Spyware, Adware, Remote Administration Tools, Dialers, Password Crackers, Jokes, and Key Loggers. 
    While PUPs do not typically have any infection capability on their own, they rely on malware or other attach mechanisms to be installed onto target hosts, 
    after which they will collect and transfer data from the host to an external host and/or will be used as attach mechanisms.

    To check that VSEL settings are configured correctly, you have to examine the config file
    available under <tt>/var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/ods.cfg</tt>.
    If this config file contains the line <tt>nailsd.profile.ODS.program: true</tt>,
    potentially unwanted programs will be scanned.

rationale: |-
    Configuring the anti-virus software to attempt to clean the file first will allow for the possibility of a false positive. 
    In most cases, however, the secondary action of delete will be used, mitigating the risk of the PUPs being installed and used maliciously.

    the <pre>ods.cfg</pre> doesn't contain the <pre>nailsd.profile.ODS.program: true</pre> line

ocil: |-
    To verify that potentially unwanted programs will be scanned, 
    check the respective VSEL config file
    <pre>/var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/ods.cfg</pre> contains the <pre>nailsd.profile.ODS.program: true</pre> line:
    <pre>grep 'nailsd.profile.ODS.program: true' /var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/ods.cfg</pre>.
