title: 'The McAfee VirusScan Enterprise for Linux 1.9.x/2.0.x On-Demand scanner must be configured to decode MIME encoded files.'

description: |-
    Malware is often packaged within an archive. In addition, archives might have other archives within. 

    To check that VSEL settings are configured correctly, you have to examine the config file
    available under <tt>/var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/ods.cfg</tt>.
    If this config file contains the line <tt>nailsd.profile.ODS.mime: true</tt>,
    potentially unwanted programs will be scanned.

rationale: |-
    Not scanning archive files introduces the risk of infected files being introduced into the environment.
