    It is imperative to protect Linux systems from malware introduced from removable media by ensuring they are scanned before use.
    
    Consult with the System Administrator of the Linux system being reviewed.
    
    Verify procedures are documented which require the manual scanning of all media used for system maintenance before media is used.
    
    If a procedure is not documented requiring the manual scanning of all media used for system maintenance before media is used, 
    this is a finding.

rationale: |-
    Removable media such as CD/DVDs allow a path for malware to be introduced to a Linux System.
