title: 'The nails user and nailsgroup group must be restricted to the least privilege access required for the intended role'

description: |-
    The McAfee VirusScan Enterprise for Linux software runs its processes under the nails user, which is part of the nailsgroup group. 
    The WEB GUI is also accessed using the nails user. 
    
    To check that nails and nailsgroup are configured correctly, access the Linux system console command line as root.
    Execute the following commands. This command will pipe the results to text files for easier review. 
    
    <tt>find / -group nailsgroup >nailsgroup.txt</tt>
    <tt>find / -user nails >nails.txt</tt>
    
    Execute the following commands to individually review each of the text files of results, pressing space bar to move to each page 
    until the end of the exported text. 
    
    <tt>more nailsgroup.txt</tt>
    <tt>more nails.txt</tt>
    
    When reviewing the results, verify the nailsgroup group and nails user only own the following paths.
    The following paths assume an INSTALLDIR of <tt>/opt/NAI/LinuxShield</tt> and a RUNTIMEDIR of <tt>/var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield</tt>. 
    If alternative folders were used, replace the following paths accordingly when validating.
    
    <tt>/var/opt/NAI</tt> and sub-folders
    <tt>/opt/NAI</tt> and sub-folders
    <tt>/McAfee/lib</tt>
    <tt>/var/spool/mail/nails</tt>
    <tt>/proc/#####</tt> (where ##### represents the various process IDs for the VSEL processes.)
    
    If any other folder is owned by either the nailsgroup group or the nails user, this is a finding.

rationale: |-
    Ensuring the nails user/nailsgroup group only has access to the required functions necessary for its 
    intended role will mitigate the possibility of the nails user/nailsgroup group from being used to perform malicious destruction to the 
    system in the event of a compromise.
