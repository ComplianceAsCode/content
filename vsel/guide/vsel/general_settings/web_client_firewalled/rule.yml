title: 'Access to the McAfee VirusScan Enterprise for Linux 1.9.x/2.0.x Web UI must be enforced by firewall rules'

description: |-
    The McAfee VirusScan Enterprise for Linux WEB GUI is the method for configuring the McAfee VSEL on a non-managed Linux system. 
    The WEB GUI on the system could be used maliciously to gain unauthorized access to the system. 
    
    To check that the WEB GUI is restricted, review the iptables configuration and confirm that access is restricted to authorized hosts

rationale: |-
    By restricting access to interface by implementing firewall rules, the risk of unauthorized access will be mitigated.
