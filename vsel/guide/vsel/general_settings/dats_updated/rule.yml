title: 'The anti-virus signature file age must not exceed 7 days'

description: |-
    Anti-virus signature files are updated almost daily by anti-virus software vendors. These files are made available to anti-virus 
    clients as they are published. Keeping virus signature files as current as possible is vital to the security of any system.
    
    To check that anti-virus signature files are updated, you have to login to the VSEL Web Monitor.
    In the VSEL WEB Monitor, under <tt>View</tt>, select <tt>Host Summary</tt>.
    In the <tt>Host Summary</tt>, verify the <tt>DAT Date:</tt> is within the last 7 days.

rationale: |-
    By configuring a system to attempt an anti-virus update on a daily basis, the system is ensured of maintaining an anti-virus signature 
    age of 7 days or less. If the update attempt were to be configured for only once a week, and that attempt failed, the system would be 
    immediately out of date.
