title: 'The McAfee VirusScan Enterprise for Linux 1.9.x/2.0.x On-Access scanner must be configured to Quarantine if first action fails when a virus or Trojan is detected'

description: |-
    Malware may have infected a file that is necessary to the user. By configuring the anti-virus software to first attempt cleaning the infected file, availability to the file is not sacrificed. 
    If a cleaning attempt is not successful, however, quarantining the file is the only safe option to ensure the malware is not introduced onto the system or network.

    To check that VSEL settings are configured correctly, you have to examine the config file
    available under <tt>/var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/nailsd.cfg</tt>.
    If this config file contains the line <tt>nailsd.profile.OAS.action.App.secondary: Quarantine</tt>,
    files that cannot be cleaned will be quarantined, preserving the file data.

rationale: |-
    Malware may have infected a file that is necessary to the user.

    To verify that files that cannot be cleaned will be quarantined, 
    check the respective VSEL config file
    <pre>/var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/nailsd.cfg</pre> contains the <pre>nailsd.profile.OAS.action.App.secondary: Quarantine</pre> line:
    <pre>grep 'nailsd.profile.OAS.action.App.secondary: Quarantine' /var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/nailsd.cfg</pre>.
