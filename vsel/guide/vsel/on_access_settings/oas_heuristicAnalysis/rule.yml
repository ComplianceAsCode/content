title: 'The McAfee VirusScan Enterprise for Linux 1.9.x/2.0.x On-Access scanner must be configured to find unknown program viruses'

description: |-
    Due to the ability of malware to mutate after infection, standard anti-virus signatures may not be able to catch new strains or variants of the malware. 
    Typically, these strains and variants will share unique characteristics with others in their virus family.  

    To check that VSEL settings are configured correctly, you have to examine the config file
    available under <tt>/var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/nailsd.cfg</tt>.
    If this config file contains the line <tt>nailsd.profile.OAS.heuristicAnalysis: true</tt>,
    unknown virus programs will be scanned.

rationale: |-
    By using a generic signature to detect the shared characteristics, using wildcards where differences lie, the generic signature can detect viruses 
    even if they are padded with extra, meaningless code. This method of detection is Heuristic detection.

    To verify that unknown virus programs will be scanned, 
    check the respective VSEL config file
    <pre>/var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/nailsd.cfg</pre> contains the <pre>nailsd.profile.OAS.heuristicAnalysis: true</pre> line:
    <pre>grep 'nailsd.profile.OAS.heuristicAnalysis: true' /var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/nailsd.cfg</pre>.
