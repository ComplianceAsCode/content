title: 'The McAfee VirusScan Enterprise for Linux 1.9.x/2.0.x On-Access scanner must be configured to decompress archives when scanning'

description: |-
    Malware can be hidden within archived files and passed from system to system undetected unless the archive is decompressed and each file scanned. 
    By disabling the archive scanning capability, archives such as .tar and .tgz files will not be decompressed and any infected files in the archives would go undetected. 

    To check that VSEL settings are configured correctly, you have to examine the config file
    available under <tt>/var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/nailsd.cfg</tt>.
    If this config file contains the line <tt>nailsd.profile.OAS.decompArchive: true</tt>,
    compressed archives will be decompressed before being scanned.

rationale: |-
    Decompression can slow performance, however; any virus-infected file inside an archive cannot become active until it has been extracted.

    To verify that compressed archives will be decompressed before being scanned, 
    check the respective VSEL config file
    <pre>/var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/nailsd.cfg</pre> contains the <pre>nailsd.profile.OAS.decompArchive: true</pre> line:
    <pre>grep 'nailsd.profile.OAS.decompArchive: true' /var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/nailsd.cfg</pre>.
