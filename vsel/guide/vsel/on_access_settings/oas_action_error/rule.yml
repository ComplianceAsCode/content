title: 'The McAfee VirusScan Enterprise for Linux 1.9.x/2.0.x On-Access scanner must be configured to deny access to the file if an error occurs during scanning'

description: |-
    Anti-virus software is the most commonly used technical control for malware threat mitigation.

    To check that VSEL settings are configured correctly, you have to examine the config file
    available under <tt>/var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/nailsd.cfg</tt>.
    If this config file contains the line <tt>nailsd.profile.OAS.action.error: Block</tt>,
    any file resulting in an error reading the file will be blocked.

rationale: |-
    Real-time scanning of files as they are read from disk is a crucial first line of defense from malware attacks.
