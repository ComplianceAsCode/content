title: 'The McAfee VirusScan Enterprise for Linux 1.9.x/2.0.x must be configured to enable On-Access scanning'

description: |-
    For anti-virus software to be effective, it must be running at all times, beginning from the point of the system's initial startup. 
    Otherwise, the risk is greater for viruses, Trojans, and other malware infecting the system during that startup phase.

    To check that VSEL settings are configured correctly, you have to examine the config file
    available under <tt>/var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/nailsd.cfg</tt>.
    If this config file contains the line <tt>nailsd.oasEnabled: true</tt>,
    the antivirus software will be running at initial startup of the system.

    To verify that the antivirus software will be running at initial startup of the system, 
    check the respective VSEL config file
    <pre>/var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/nailsd.cfg</pre> contains the <pre>nailsd.oasEnabled: true</pre> line:
    <pre>grep 'nailsd.oasEnabled: true' /var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/nailsd.cfg</pre>.
