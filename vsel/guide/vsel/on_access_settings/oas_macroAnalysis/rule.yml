title: 'The McAfee VirusScan Enterprise for Linux 1.9.x/2.0.x On-Access scanner must be configured to find unknown macro viruses'

description: |-
    Interpreted viruses are executed by an application. Within this subcategory, macro viruses take advantage of the capabilities of 
    applications' macro programming language to infect application documents and document templates, while scripting viruses infect 
    scripts that are understood by scripting languages processed by services on the OS.  

    To check that VSEL settings are configured correctly, you have to examine the config file
    available under <tt>/var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/nailsd.cfg</tt>.
    If this config file contains the line <tt>nailsd.profile.OAS.macroAnalysis: true</tt>,
    unknown macro viruses will be scanned.

rationale: |-
    Many attackers use toolkits containing several different types of utilities and scripts that can be used to probe and attack hosts.
    Scanning for unknown macro viruses will mitigate zero-day attacks.

    To verify that unknown macro viruses will be scanned, 
    check the respective VSEL config file
    <pre>/var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/nailsd.cfg</pre> contains the <pre>nailsd.profile.OAS.macroAnalysis: true</pre> line:
    <pre>grep 'nailsd.profile.OAS.macroAnalysis: true' /var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/nailsd.cfg</pre>.
