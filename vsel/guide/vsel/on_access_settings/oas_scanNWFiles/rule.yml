title: 'The McAfee VirusScan Enterprise for Linux 1.9.x/2.0.x On-Access scanner must be enabled to scan mounted volumes when mounted volumes point to a network server without an anti-virus solution installed'

description: |-
    It is imperative to protect Linux systems from malware introduced from those other network systems by either ensuring the remote systems are protected or by scanning files from those systems when they are accessed.

    To check that VSEL settings are configured correctly, you have to examine the config file
    available under <tt>/var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/nailsd.cfg</tt>.
    If this config file contains the line <tt>nailsd.profile.OAS.scanNWFiles: true</tt>,
    files on network mounts are scanned.

rationale: |-
    Mounting network volumes to other network systems introduces a path for malware to be introduced.
