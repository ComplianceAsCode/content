title: 'The McAfee VirusScan Enterprise for Linux 1.9.x/2.0.x On-Access scanner must be configured to scan files when being read from disk'

description: |-
    Anti-virus software is the most commonly used technical control for malware threat mitigation. 

    To check that VSEL settings are configured correctly, you have to examine the config file
    available under <tt>/var/opt/NAI/LinuxShield/etc/nailsd.cfg</tt>.
    If this config file contains the line <tt>nailsd.profile.OAS.scanOnRead: true</tt>,
    files will be scanned when read from disk.

rationale: |-
    Real-time scanning of files as they are read from disk is a crucial first line of defense from malware attacks.
