These templates are designed to make generation of OVAL tests
which have repetitive structure easier.

For example:
	$ ./create_services_disabled.py services_disabled.csv
will produce all the OVAL checks (in a shorthand format)
to disable services, and store them in the output directory.

The CSV input files should contain all the relevant information
for each check.  Files should be compared to existing OVAL checks
for consistency before copying to the main checks directory.


A Makefile exists to activate all the scripts here and ease comparison
with existing checks. For example, to run all scripts to generate
OVAL checks from the available templates:
	$ make templates

To compare the newly-generated files in the output directory to the existing
checks, run:
	$ make compare

Then, if the changes are agreeable, the following command can be run to copy the
newly generated files to the main checks directory:
	$ make copy

To list files that have been manually created (and may potentially be
templated), run:
	# make find-untemplated

Note, however, that some checks may have been intentionally hand-edited.
For example, some sysctl checks (such as for IPv6) may include additional
tests so that they pass if the IPv6 module is disabled.  Never blindly
copy over existing checks.
