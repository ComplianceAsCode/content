<title>Required Java Settings</title>
<description>To support a secured and compliant configuration, a number of 
settings need to be modified from there default configuration and locked so 
that they are prevented from being changed.</description>

<Rule id="deployment_config_exists" severity="medium">
<title>A configuration file must be present to deploy properties for JRE.</title>
<description>
The deployment.config file is used for specifying the location and execution of 
system-level properties for the Java Runtime Environment.  By default no 
deployment.config file exists; thus, no system-wide deployment.properties file exists.  
Without the deployment.config file, setting particular options for the Java 
control panel is impossible.

<Rule id="deployment_config_configured" severity="medium">
<title>The configuration file must contain proper keys and values to deploy settings correctly.</title>
<description>
This configuration file must hold values of the location of the deployment.properties file as 
well as the enforcement of these properties.  Without a proper path for the properties file, 
deployment would not be possible.  If the path specified does not lead to a properties file 
the value of the 'deployment.system.config. mandatory' key determines how to handle the situation.  
If the value of this key is true, JRE will not run if the path to the properties file is invalid.

<Rule id="deployment_properties_exists" severity="medium">
<title>A properties file must be present to hold all the keys that 
establish properties within the Java control panel.</title>
<description>
The deployment.properties file is used for specifying 
keys for the Java Runtime Environment. Each option in the Java control 
panel is represented by property keys. These keys adjust the options 
in the Java control panel based on the value assigned to that key. 
By default no deployment.properties file exists; thus, no system-wide 
exists. Without the deployment.properties file, setting particular 
options for the Java control panel is impossible.

<Rule id="untrusted_sources" severity="medium">
<title>The dialog to enable users to grant permissions to execute signed 
content from an un-trusted authority must be disabled.</title>
<description>
Java applets exist both signed and unsigned.  Even for signed applets, there 
can be many sources, some of which may be purveyors of malware.  Applet sources 
considered trusted can have their information populated into the browser, 
enabling Java to validate applets against trusted sources.
</description>
<rationale>Permitting execution of signed Java applets from un-trusted sources 
may result in acquiring malware, and risks system modification, invasion of 
privacy, or denial of service.

<Rule id="validation_crl" severity="medium">
<title>The setting for users to check publisher certificates for revocation 
must be enabled.</title>
<description>
A certificate revocation list is a directory which contains a 
list of certificates that have been revoked for various reasons. Certificates 
may be revoked due to improper issuance, compromise of the certificate, 
and failure to adhere to policy. Therefore, any certificate found on a CRL 
should not be trusted. Permitting execution of an applet published with a 
revoked certificate may result in spoofing, malware, system modification, 
invasion of privacy, and denial of service.

<Rule id="validation_ocsp" severity="medium">
<title>The option to enable online certificate validation must be enabled.</title>
<description>
Online certificate validation provides a real-time option to 
validate a certificate. When enabled, if a certificate is presented, the 
status of the certificate is requested. The status is sent back as 'current', 
'expired', or 'unknown'. Online certificate validation provides a greater 
degree of validation of certificates when running a signed Java applet. 
Permitting execution of an applet with an invalid certificate may result 
in malware execution , system modification, invasion of privacy, and denial 
of service.

<title>The version of the JRE running on the system must be the most current available.</title>
<description>
The JRE is being continually updated by the vendor in order to address identified 
security vulnerabilities.  Running an older version of the JRE can introduce security 
vulnerabilities to the system.
