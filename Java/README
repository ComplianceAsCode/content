Directory Structure of scap-security-guide
------------------------------------------

The input directory contains source files that generate SCAP content, such as
XCCDF and OVAL.  Since a single large XML file is an impractical format for
multiple authors to collaborate on editing SCAP content, efforts are made to
keep logically related guidance and checking content in individual files.

The transforms directory contains resources that enable the files inside the
input directory (or output directory) to be combined and reformatted into
valid SCAP formats or human-readable formats.

The output directory is used as a storage area for items generated by the files
in the inputs directory.  It should be empty in the repository, and built on
users' individual systems (and rely on its .gitignore file to keep such files
out).  The output directory contains transitional output (which may only exist
in order to be further transformed) as well as final output.

The references directory should contain documents which are specified as
references from within the SCAP content, or documents that are "seeds," viz.
documents whose prose will be translated into SCAP formats, as well as other
examples of SCAP content.

The utils directory contains helper scripts and other items that are useful to
developers but are not essential to producing the project's output.

The dist directory contains final outputs, which could be shipped in an RPM for
consumption by end-users.  Updating the Makefile to copy an item from the
outputs directory to the dist directory indicates that an item is considered a
final output.
