<title override="true">C2S for Red Hat Enterprise OpenShift Container Platform 3 Master Node</title>
<description override="true">This profile demonstrates compliance against the
U.S. Government Commercial Cloud Services (C2S) baseline.

This baseline was inspired by the Center for Internet Security
(CIS) Kubernetes Benchmark, v1.2.0 - 01-31-2017.

For the SCAP Security Guide project to remain in compliance with
CIS' terms and conditions, specifically Restrictions(8), note
there is no representation or claim that the C2S profile will
ensure a system is in compliance or consistency with the CIS
baseline.
