  <title>DRAFT Guide to the Secure Configuration of Red Hat OpenStack</title>
  <description>This guide is designed to provide comprehensive discussion of security-relevant configuration settings for Red Hat OpenStack. Providing system administrators with such information enables them to securely configure systems under their control in a variety of network roles. This guide also provides policy makers with a comprehensive catalog of settings, from which security baselines can be constructed. The XCCDF format enables granular selection and adjustment of settings, and their association with OVAL and OCIL content provides an automated checking capability. Transformations of this document, and its associated automated checking content, are capable of providing baselines that meet a diverse set of policy objectives.</description>
  <notice id="terms_of_use">Do not attempt to implement any of the settings in this guide without first testing them in a non-operational environment. The creators of this guidance assume no responsibility whatsoever for its use by other parties, and makes no guarantees, expressed or implied, about its quality, reliability, or any other characteristic.</notice>
