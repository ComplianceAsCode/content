not clearly relate.

<Rule id="update_process">
<title>A process for prompt installation of OS updates must exist.</title>
<rationale>
This is a manual inquiry about update procedure.
</rationale>
<ocil>
Ask an administrator if a process exists to promptly and automatically apply OS
software updates.  If such a process does not exist, this is a finding.
</ocil> 
<description>
Procedures to promptly apply software updates must be established and
executed. The Red Hat operating system provides support for automating such a
process, by running the yum program through a cron job or by managing the
system and its packages through the Red Hat Network or a Satellite Server.
